"Burns, Sandra","try to avoid this class as much as you can. Yes you might think the class is easy and why am I complaining but Proffessor burns is terrible at teaching, has absolutely no helpful feedback when it comes to her WEEKLY quizzes and worst part is she doesnt even teach. Her method of teaching is 8 practice problems of the same topic everyday. Stay away. | She wasn't the best professor, but she wasn't the worst. Her classes are boring and there are quizzes almost every week. But she does want to help you as much as she can. She has a lot of review sessions and office hours if you are having trouble. | Prof Burns was really nice and understanding. I hate math and she made the workload more manageable. It's up to you if you want the A and if you put the effort in you will get it. She's very lenient with curves and extra points too. | Most irritating class I have ever taken from start to finish. Professor is not helpful whatsoever and barely responds to emails. Not transparent with the content that is on quizzes/exams, throws random things in these exams that you have not gone over, doesn't give enough time to learn material, does not teach in a way that is effective at all. | Horrible professor, she has no idea how to teach or structure a class. She ignores you when you ask questions. She gives quizzes and exams with too many questions that could possibly be answered in the time she gives you. she gives no explainations for anything she does in her class, and gives no homework for practice. stay away from her class | Professor Burns is a very sweet professor who cares about her students. She wants you to pass the class however, she confuses herself a lot during class. Before the final, she had three review sessions, I went to the last one on the day of the final and got a B. You need to work hard for your grade show up for the review and do the homework. | She only teaches one way, and if it's not her way you're wrong. When yo ask her questions she answers them the same way she first described them so it's no help. Everyone does poorly on her test and she even says they're hard, but she chooses to not make them any easier. She doesn't know how to work Sakai so good luck seeing your grades. | she seemed to be taking her time in case other ppl didn't understand subject matter but its middle school math literally repeated. she goes so slow, but I think this is the dept's fault not hers. dreaded this class every day, such a waste of time and money but it had to get done. she does confuse herself sometimes like a previous poster said. | she is very sweet and cares for her students but she sometimes confuses herself a lot in class and it can sometimes send the class backward, therefore, unable to complete the lesson of the day. She will help you as long as she sees your trying. | Great teacher. just show up to class, participate and work on homework assignments to pass the quizzes/tests. Work hard for the exams and final especially but all the notes she gives are pretty clear and go ask for extra help if needed. She usually curves the exams and doesn't check homework but it's up to u for practice | Professor Burns, while sweet, is very condescending and treats her students not like they're in college but like they're completely incapable of their own thought. | Such a sweet lady, always wan ted to stay after to help. Gives great reviews before exams and does not check homework. | She was a great teacher, really set on helping you do the best that you can. Attendance is mandatory, she takes it everyday, and seems to grade you better if you show up & participate. Lots of homework, but doesn't check. Does a good job preparing you for your exam with same questions. | She is extremely smart and knows Math very well. She always tried to explain Math concepts in different ways for people that didn't understand. She made Math enjoyable. Such a sweet person and always willing to stay after and help. If you study, do homework, and ask questions if you don't understand, there is no exception but to receive an A. | Professor Burns is the nicest lady ever! She was extremely helpful and wanted everyone to pass. She always stayed after to help people. She gave lots of practice work to prepare us for exams. I like how she would give out old exams with solved solutions to show how equations were solved. Loved her class! | Adorable old woman. I almost feel like she dumb-ed down the class, but it made it much easier to understand [plus my class was full of idiots anyways]. Sometimes, she makes mistakes or is confused, but she really simplifies what you have to do. Went from failing the class before to passing awesomely with her. Take her! | she is very nice and doesn't hold back when you need help but sometimes she's a little lost and makes mistakes and the class has to point them out. she's a nice person though and very sweet, not hard to pass | Alright, Professor Burns is a nice woman. She is helpful and very sweet.She does however have her head in the clouds and doesn't know what she is doing sometimes. Shes skips off to LaLa Land on occasion and is a little confusing. Overall is helpful though and if you go to class and pay attention you should do well."
"Patel, Saiju","professor patel is genuinely a great professor. she uploads the lecture notes onto canvas and her office hours are extremely helpful. however, her exams are somewhat challenging as she wants you to actually learn and understand the material so that you are better prepared for future math courses. i would recommend her to anyone taking calc. | Just don't take her. Look for a professor that can actually teach rather than the professor that fills up your schedule perfectly. She's not worth the grade you'll get. | Never take her class, its terrible | She goes over lecture really fast and it didn't really give my brain time to process. There's like 3-6 assignments a week and they kinda help with the work and quiz that's in recitation. Currently retaking with another prof to get a better grade bc i couldn't go to second part. Also if you see a mistake in your exam TELL HER. | AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. I literally saw the class getting smaller each week due to multiple people dropping everyday. | Great professor! Really cares about her students. In class quizzes at the end of semester. Tough grader but drops 5 lowest quiz & HW grades. Recitation quiz weekly (5 questions) HW is very easy. Study, do the work, & show up for class, no reason you won't succeed. All notes posted on canvas & makes sure you understand the material. 100% recommend. | I loved that this professor posted the lecture notes on Canvas for every class. | literally these people are so overdramatic. this was the only professor ive ever had that gave SO many resources to help the students. she actually teaches the class and makes sure people are understanding. given, there are a lot of cengage hw assignments but they are literally worth 1% of your grade so you dont have to do them?? just go to class. | Great professor, went through every problem super carefully and made things easy to understand. I've never been good at math but I finally understood math because of this class. It is really important to study outside of class and she gives lots of homework and like a quiz every week but as long as you try even a little bit you'll be fine. | make sure you know everything before you come to class. SHE DOES NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING! | BAD PROFESSOR!!!!!!! | drop or withdrawal this class AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN! | The worst professor I've met in my whole life! DON'T CHOOSE HER AS YOUR PROFESSOR!!!! | Every class or recitation there is a quiz! Homework hidden in Cengage. Horrible Professor. | Gave 3 question quizzes every week and gave about 3 homework assignments as well. Each quiz went over a different unit. There is no partial grading, there is no extra credit, and your work must be done in a specific way for her to mark correct. Furthermore, the lectures are very fast paces and have little substance. Zoom-only office hours. | Patel is a horrible professor. She does not teach, she goes through problems extremely quickly without any explanation as to why. Everything I learned throughout the semester came purely from watching youtube videos on how to do the problems she was ""teaching"". She also gets corrected for her answers being completely wrong at least 3 times a class. | Avoid | If you show up to her office hours and make attempts to reach out to her I feel like she becomes more willing to help you out (I also took 111 with her). ATTENDANCE MATTERS, can lose points toward your grade, and homework and quizzes are multiple. Does require you to be flexible with your learning style and doing any practice she gives helps. | Do not take this class if you struggle with testing. The entire class is graded on test taking ability and lectures are extremely anxiety provoking. There is no extra credit opportunity and professor does not respect mental health issues. | Just don't take her. Poor communication, rude to students and does not care if you do well or not. Imposes strange rules and has a strict ""no make up"" policy no matter the circumstances. Trust me. You are better off without her. I would give a zero if I could. | good professor, she wants you to succeed. The material is challenging and she goes VERY fast, but if you tell her to slow down she does, she doesn't mean to teach so fast. Do all review sheets and her hardest questions, and exams will feel easier. Attendance very mandatory. | Prof. Patel is a great professor for those looking to obtain a good foundation for the fundamental materials used in higher level math courses. Her course definitely requires work outside of class so practice. | Definitely a class you have to put effort in, don't expect to never show up and pass - nothing to do w the Prof tho thats just Precalc2. If you want to do well though take Patel because the lectures cover the material so well. She does everything to set you up for success so tbh if you do bad its only your own fault. | I have honestly never had a worse math professor/teacher than this woman. She is horrible at teaching math, I have a pretty strong background in math and struggled to understand her teaching methods. I stopped going to lectures even though she grades attendance because it was easier to teach myself rather than listen to her for 80 min. | I usually do not write reviews for professors but she truly did not respect me as a student IMO. She is a very tough grader, and she takes of points for no reason on quizzes. And if you ask why you got points off she is very stern, and makes you feel bad for asking. I wish I had taken this course with someone else, try not to take it with her. | She went very fast and I couldn't understand. It was a struggle to understand all the information. She thinks everyone knows whats happening. Would not recommend taking her | Do not take this Professor. She's nice but her lectures are so hard to understand. 6 homework assignments a week and quizzes almost every class with no review before hand. Quizzes are 3 questions and with no partial credit. The only extra credit all semester is correcting the exam study guide, so we don't even know if our study material is correct. | Quizzes are only 2-3 questions/she does not give partial credit. The study guides from different math courses and tells us numbers of problems instead of making one with all the questions in one doc. She also gives 1 point credit on exams if u point out mistakes on one of her study guides so u never know if it is right or not. Horrible & very judgy | I took her over the summer for Calc 1 and most, if not all the students, were simply just dissatisfied with her lack of understanding the students needs. Students even had to reach out to the course coordinator for her to take action. Took points off for the slightest mistake and was a tough grader. Try to take a different professor if you can. | Professor Patel was one of the best math professors I've had. She explains lessons perfectly and clearly. Go to ALL her classes and attend office hours if you have to. Ask questions and do the homework + textbook questions. She gives you all the tools you need to succeed, and you will, but you have to put in the effort. | DO NOT TAKE PRE-CALC with prof Patel if you don't have a strong backround in math. She was not a horrible teacher but not good either, it seemed like she wanted everyone to pass but she is not good at explaining topics well and sometimes. I had to attempt to teach myself the lessons after the second exam because she wasn't helpful at all. | I was a little worried going into this class after looking at other ratings, but I honestly found Prof. Patel to be a pretty good lecturer. The exams are a difficult and a lot of homework is given, but lots of review is also provided. It seemed that she really wanted us to understand material during lecture and answered questions enthusiastically. | attendance is mandatory , once you get 4 absences your grade drops a letter. significantly harder exams then other professors. she is a good person though, and is understanding as long as your present in class | Mrs. Patel was a great professor. As long as you came to class consistently and went to her office hours she would help you as much as you needed. Math 026 is not a great class because of the curriculum but she makes it better. She makes the test prep a bit difficult but it pays off when you get your exam grades back. | Just do the homework and that quizzes are almost identical. Use the reviews she posts and you'll be good for the exams | She was pretty average. Not great but not too bad. I would definitely take her class again. | Honestly she's not the best, but also not the worst. She gets pretty upset when you ask questions even though she encouraged us to do that, but then also gets upset when we're quiet. Her teaching style isn't bad tho. Pretty straight to the point and uses lots of examples so she can teach diff methods. She wasn't AMAZING, but I would take her again. | Professor Patel is okay, she isn't the most nice or understanding. It personally took a while for me to get used to her teaching style and the online format but after I got used to it I did better in her class. Be prepared for a lot of homework and quizzes. You really need to have a solid understanding of the material to do well in the class. | I dont understand half of these reviews. Sure she was strict but she was encouraging and caring. She wanted students to succeed. I felt super prepared for the final, was a breeze. And this is coming from someone who got Cs on the first two midterms. | Good teacher! She definitely challenges her students, but in a good way. Honestly though if you never took Pre Calc prior to this class, its gonna be extremely difficult. | Never has a professor nearly driven me to drop college entirely. This course was so extremely difficult for all the wrong reasons: overcomplicated methods, a lack of communication with students, and ZERO communication between herself and the recitation officer. Not to mention the weekly quizzes were exponentially more difficult than the homework. | The professor was not even willing to accept her mistakes, not grade fairly, never going to take her class again, really disappointed. | Professor Patel is pretty 50/50 in my opinion. At times she can be very helpful and understanding (even goes as far to give extra credit for assignments). But she can also be a bit tedious when it comes to grading tests and quizzes and prefers he own methods rather than the recitation instructors'. The online lectures seem impossible to learn in. | She's extremely difficult. I went to office hours constantly, and always went to class. I don't know if it was because I had her fully online but there was no way of learning from her teaching style, I had to fully teach myself. You can't ask questions because she'll get mad at you and she'll get mad at you for not asking questions too. Not good. | Dr. Patel's homework is quite easy. The quizzes extremely hard. It feels like an entirely different chapter. She also goes so fast in lectures and gets mad when students ask questions and mad when they don't. Terrible prof. Take anyone else. | I' m not sure how she is in-person, but her online courses are bad. She goes through the course really fast and gets upset when people don't understand or don't follow. She glosses over the steps when she teaches. IMO the recitation prof was a lot better. | Makes very simple things extremely complicated | She is one of the less difficult professors in the math department. She explains concepts in an understandable way but she takes her time on each question so you wouldnt be able to finish on time on an exam if you did her methods. Summer calc class was open notes but super hard. Tried my best but I dont think Ill even end with a C. :( | could have easily got an A in this class but the way she grades exams is very weird. The first exam is a sum up of algebra and some pre calc intro concepts and the second exam plus the final cover more intense topics. She has a way with teaching but is awful when it comes to grading, she abides by her own rules which I find disappointing. | Failed this class freshman year and had to retake it. She was a way better professor than my first. Exams are hard but she gives you practice exams to study off of. Kind of hard tot tell what she is saying sometimes. Quizzes I mostly failed since they are only like 3 questions each. I stopped going to lectures after the midterm. | Professor Patel was not helpful at all. I got excused absences from the school and she didn't accept them. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I had to withdraw because her lectures felt like forever long | I found that the way Professor Patel presented the material was easy for me to grasp. I did well on the homework and quizzes, but the exams were my downfall. The math at Rutgers is much too hard. No index card with formulas was allowed, formulas were not supplied on the exam, graphing calculators were not allowed either. | I failed calc in the fall and then retook it over the summer. She was such an upgrade compared to my prof in the fall. She is a tough grader, but she does that because she wants her students to be up to par with how the math department wants us to do the work on the final. She really pushes her students to be the best they can be. | She is AWFUL. I don't know how people gave her a good review because she's one of the reasons I failed Precalc Part 1. She takes off points for every single little thing. If it's not done her way or her methods then it's wrong and you'll fail. She taught math in a very conceptual way which made it hard to understand simple problems. | We had to teach everything to ourselves she didn't cover the topics that were going to be on the departmental exam, she would start quizzes 5 mins before class started at 8AM so if you were on time you couldn't take them. She didn't explain to us how the grading scheme worked and told us none of us were good enough to take calculus. | She teaches at a very fast pace. She literally grades everything which is awful. She assigns a lot of problems for homework and then checks them for accuracy. Some answers are in the back of the textbook but don't worry she knows that and takes off points if there isn't any work shown or how its ""supposed"" to be solved. She never cancels class. | Really just a great professor. Her lectures were interesting and she explains concepts very well. She prepares you for exams very well and the hw and quizzes are manageable. | I had Professor Patel for Precalc Part 1 and wish I could take her again for Part 2, she is amazing and will help any student who goes to her as long as you make the time. Each exam she sends out links to packets and book problems that you should practice and turns the last class to a review session. She's a great professor | If you're taking math 111, take Patel. She is very thorough and is by far the best math professor I've ever had. The class in general is hard, so if you want to learn something, you should take it with her. If you go to her office hours, you'll definitely pass the class. She is so kind and motivational and believes in every one of her students. | She isn't the worst, she can be funny at times. Focus on how she likes things set up or you'll lose points on problems. She can make quiz/exam questions harder than homework, you just have to apply yourself and put the effort. You should definitely attend class to not get lost. Drops 2 lowest quiz grades. Wants students to pass. | Not a great math teacher for precalc. Wasnt able to understand her and had to figure out a lot of material on my own. Quizzes class about 1-3 times per week. | Honestly she is the best Calc professor out here. Don't go by reviews she is really the best calc professor. She is going to go tough cuz she want u to pass. go to office hours to get clear understanding. honeslty take her | She takes the time to explain everything in explicit detail and lists the steps word for word, rather than just doing the math and hoping everyone follows along. She is definitely one of the better math professors here. | One of the toughest math professors I've ever had. Is a tough grader. Will take points off for the smallest details! She is never available for her office hours and her office hours are only for 30 minutes. Will never take her again. Her teaching method is horrible. | Took her over the summer. Gave out the hardest math quizzes and exams you could ever imagine. She claimed that she's willing to help you, but when I had tried asking for help outside of the classroom (in her office or by e-mail), she would not properly respond to me. Also didn't seem to care much. Would not recommend if you want to save your GPA. | She loves to help her students, and this is highly valued as she'll stop class to help you understand ANYTHING, even the foundational basics. She cares, & genuinely encourages her students to go to her office ours for extra help. Lectures are important, go to all, take good notes, study hard, ask questions, attend office hours & you'll pass. | If you are talking 115 (or even 111), take PATEL! So many kids who failed the class but took her with me said she is much better! Class is as you hear; very fast and quiz heavy. She does care about her students and is always available after class for webassign help. I am usually shy but connected with her better than my other professors! Good luck! | The 115 for mat of precalc is very fast, it goes by one chapter in two lectures easily, so you really don't have time to understand the concepts unless you practice practice and practice from the book!! She might make mathematical mistakes from time-time but if you catch them then you are paying Attention ! Always PRACTICE and go to office hours!!! | Make sure you have a SOLID understanding of Intermediate Algebra, she moves quickly but it pretty good at explaining concepts if you pay close attention. Often makes errors though when doing problems. | She's great!! It's tough material but Professor Patel makes it very clear. If you pay attention and do what she says, you WILL pass."
"Schwartz, Sharon","I really didnt like her as her comments made towards students were typically inappropriate. She is very much like a middle school teacher but grades as if this is grad school. There isnt enough things to be graded on, only exams and quizzes making it hard to get a decent grade. No extra credit. | The first day of class, she told her students that within her many years of teaching this course at Rutgers, she has never seen an A in that class. She rarely sees B's, and that C's and D's were common for her class. She taught and explained the material well but the quizzes and tests were much harder than what was actually taught in class. | As long as you take good notes, read over them, and attend class, you should do well. If you need any additional help, she is usually accessible. Doing the homework helped me but it is not mandatory. You will have three exams and quizzes every now and then. | Schwartz is a great professor. She explains the concepts very well, but if you skip class, you're basically screwed. Unless you're naturally good at algebra, DO THE HOMEWORK. Seriously, you'd be surprised how much it helps prepare you for the quizzes and tests. On that note, they are slightly difficult so make sure you understand the material. | Professor Schwartz is a good lecturer, but the work done in class is nothing like on the test. Problems are very simplified in class and she does no words problems at all, BUT word problems are on every test. | I have always struggled with math and this class has been a turning point for me. Professor Schwartz explains concepts really well. Her notes are clear and she always takes time to answer questions from her homework. Her office hours are extremely helpful. She will emphasize problems from class/homework that will be on exams. | She prides herself on her notes, but it would help if she put what chapter each subject was. Only collected homework when she saw most kids were absent. Easy A if you pay attention and do the homework and come to class. She tries to scare you with the final but study and you will pass. | I absolutely HATE math. I cannot stand it, it is the one thing I thought I would never understand. Professor Schwartz gets it. She explains math in a way that students who are not good at grasping the concepts, understand. By far the best semester of math I have ever had because of her. | Good teacher, explains concepts well, but its opposed to what seems to be any form of technology. NO laptops, Nothing higher than a middle school grade scientific calculator, does NOT post any homework assignments, schedules or notes on Sakai. Seems a bit closed minded, but as far as teaching math itself she gets the job done. | Just the Most amazing teacher I've ever had for math. Explains topics better than any high school teacher and college professor in North America. Sharon is my girl and teaches the best, most educational class in Rutgers. | She is an EXCELLENT TEACHER. She teaches very clearly, You can't miss anything. She lets you know how you're doing. Homework assignments are simple and not overwhelming. Attendance is mandatory but You'll want to go. Awesome Teacher!! Nice, takes her time. I advice EVERYONE to take her. SERIOUSLY, I don't think anyone could surpass her. | Great Professor. One of the best math teachers I've ever had. Explains everything super throughly, so if you pay attention you'll never get confused. Gives the best and most organized notes, and offers a lot of help. She's a little old fashioned, but she's friendly and nice. Trust me, you should take her."
"Perkowski, James","It's clear from simply sitting in class that Dr. Perkowski cares about his students' understanding and success. Calculus is not the easiest material and I struggled to grasp it, but he was incredibly approachable in explaining. Isn't too accessible outside of class, but always stayed later and never rushed us with the weekly quiz. | I like Prof Perkowski as a person he is very funny and kind but I'm sorry he is horrible at teaching...The way he does recitation is very unorganized and confuses a lot of students. He does often make mistakes but I don't blame him we're all human. It's very hard to reach him outside of class and sometimes he doesn't show up for office hours | I had him for my PreCalc recitation this fall and he was a great teacher. Gives very good notes on quizzes so you understand what you did wrong. makes little jokes throughout class, and cares about everyone's safety and wellbeing with the pandemic. | would not recommend this professor never answers emails never knows what he is doing, you have a quiz every single class period exams are very hard is not accessible outside of class overall WORST class ever taken here at Rutgers | His teaching style is very unique and it wasn't for me. I want to say his grading is strict but I don't really have a reference to compare with. If you are able to control yourself and not get bored during his lecture you will pass. I had to basically just use the textbook to get through the course since I couldn't understand his methods of solving | He is not a good teacher and makes many mistakes while teaching. Doesnt respond to emails. | To say the least, this professor wasn't my favorite. He is very inaccessible outside of class and doesn't answer his emails. His lectures mainly consist of him doing practice problems that he does not explain properly and then him making mistakes on said practice problems. Avoid taking this class if you can. | Uhh, so I didn't think he was THAT bad. But I probably wouldn't take him again. He knows his stuff, but isn't the best teacher. He also doesn't respond to emails which is a huge problem sometimes. However, I would always present my questions after class, and he was receptive, which helped a lot. | Awful teacher. Makes so many mistakes each class even though he has the answers right in front of him. Doesnt explain anything or respond to emails. Whatever you do dont take him. One time he gave up on a problem because he didnt know how to do it like your the professor. | Probably the worst teacher Ive ever had in general. Makes so many mistakes when doing practice problems. He does practice problems and doesnt explain anything, youre just along for the ride. Even after doing homework and attending every single lecture you need to put in HOURS of studying to pass a class that should not be hard. | Professor is unorganized and isn't aware of his own syllabus. When I seeked helped or extra credit, he said that I would pass my final and that was it. I mentioned that tutoring wasn't helping as much, and he didn't give a response. I basically taught myself, this course isn't supposed to be hard! | I studied for 2 weeks straight for my test and still failed. He doesn't respond to emails and doesn't know what he is teaching. He literally gave up on a problem because he didn't know how to do it. If you want to pass Pre-calc don't take him. | He seems to be a very nice man but his style of teaching is very complicated and unorganized. When you sign up for this class you sign up to teach yourself. The class material probably wouldnt be that hard if I had somebody teaching me properly but with this professor, Itll be a miracle if I pass the class. | He is nice and accommodating at times but he is terrible at teaching. His lectures were boring and unorganized ( terrible handwriting) in addition to constant mistakes. The exams he makes are not similar to the material he teaches at all! There are quizzes every other lecture that take up to 30 mins. He does not answer emails at all. Avoid!! | One of the worst professors I have had at RU. Took my first math class at RU with him and it was a horrible experience. He doesn't know how to teach and supper boring. The worst thing is he made a lot of mistakes during the lectures. Avoid at all costs! | Cool prof, likes to make jokes but he makes careless mistakes on the board. If you took algebra in high school you'll be fine, but its easy to make foolish mistakes on his quizzes and tests. He gives partial credit and tries to answer questions. Overall an okay teacher. Just do the homework and try to get the textbook so material is easier to learn"
"Collins, Eliot","Once you get past the tough and boring exterior, you can learn to really like prof Collins. He makes you work for your grade and does not TEACH math. He does practice examples on the board and you are expected to take notes and teach yourself at home. If you failed ur placement test and are stuck in the class just do ur work and you'll get an A | Ok teacher. He teaches from the book but he's quite helpful and caring. When I needed help or emailed he responded promptly and took time to speak with me after class. He is a bit quirky but, that makes him less intimating. Overall, do HW and study before tests, Elementary is easy if you practice! | Professor Collins reads directly from the text book every single class and actually uses those exact questions from the book on his exams. His tests are super easy but never multiple choice. He is such a nice guy but teaching just is not his thing. | Absolutely need to go to class and do all the homeworks and reviews if you want to pass. I was very diligent in the beginning seeing all the kids in my class that seemed like they weren't going to take this class seriously because it was Elementary Algebra, luckily it paid off. You don't need to study for the amount of hours he says, just do all hw | Nice guy, wants people to do well even though precalc and algebra aren't easy to get a good grade in. he's also kind of funny | He helps you whenever you need help, because i have a lot of difficulty at math. i like that hes very patient, and he is a cutie when it comes to helping you out. A little weird , but its okay, he means well. | He's a nice guy, but don't expect to learn anything. Copies examples straight from the book onto the board and solves the problem, but doesn't really explain how to do it yourself. The book doesn't help with that either. He goes off on random tangents, talking about politics or his family, or his other job. I'd avoid him if possible. | At first he comes off a little stiff, but once you get into it he does really know his stuff and he is very helpful. It also helps that he is a really quirky guy. He made taking Elements of Algebra not a chore :) | okay hes a really nice guy but cant really teach for his life. he's not helpful and i can never understand what he's talking about. the class doesnt count for anything though so whatever. | horrible teacher. teaches straight from the book. had this class at night with nothing before it. i would sleep all day, go to class refreshed and still fall asleep. very self centered. talks about the 18 different jobs he has all the time. is just plain horrible. | No Comments | blah | he's nice, but random.. his methods are strange and always different. he's hard to follow. | this guy likes to hear himself talk and voice his opinion on stuff that doesnt even relate to class. no one cares what he thinks. he talks down to you like you are a child. he doesnt teach, just simply puts the examples from the book on the board. you basically have to teach yourself the whole semester. | This guy is boring and he is bald but hes the only bald guy without a shine. Im dissapointed in his teaching and he talks way too much about his son and his views on life and his marathons. Ill give him props for being able to run 26 miles in one race. | he has to be the WORST! he is soooo boring and it is so hard to not fall asleep in his class! he talks about his son ALL the time! i dont care about his friggin son! just teach me and let me out!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! | This Prof, is a total nightmare, and really quite negetive although the material is easy. It would be a lot better if he was positive, but in the end harmless. | Professor Collins is really down to earth. He seems to try a lot to be friendly, and to be fair. The material is super easy so he really doesn't have much to teach, but he seems to teach it clearly enough to follow. | i have this dude for Elem Alg and OMG.. its SOO BORING.. he comes in..teaches straight out of the book,i keep falin asleep,& all he cares about is the EXAM&getting questions right and**** like that.. he acualy takes atendance.. hello this is COLLEGE..... | he's ok not great and not bad | He stutters constantly"
"Romano, Alfred","Mr Romano is hands down the best math teacher I've ever had in all my 4 years of highschool. I took his Calc honors class and I think getting him as my math teacher was the best part of my year. I feel extremely welcome in his class and he makes a big effort to remember his students names. Keep up the good work Mr. Romano! | Mr. Romano is the best!!!!!! He was my Calculus-1 Honors teacher and he was the best math teacher I've ever had. He always writes good feedback on tests, but it is so important to include notation in your work. He cracks so many jokes and makes his class enjoyable. | egg-headed lecturer with little to no knowledge. Someone has got to keep his ego in check, out here teaching elementary algebra thinking he's allat. We all know he barely got by with his degree, so he reciprocates his experience. peculiar individual. | Amazing professor. Made material very easy to learn, and gave us a lot of advice and help on how to succeed in his class and at Rutgers. He is also very witty and makes class quite fun. Definitely would take another one of his classes. | I like this professor. He's nice but kind of serious. It also help me more knowledge for many math problems and he teaches really good. I work really hard on my quizzes and exams but I need to tried my best and go to office hours so that way I could understand better. | Professor Romano was great at explaining new concepts and encouraged learning. Not a warm and fuzzy type, but is still nice enough. Attendance is counted, and I highly recommend attending class because you won't know what you're doing otherwise. Quizzes are easy, tests are a little harder but he provides a study guide. | You'd think this class would be easy, but I was constantly anxious the entire semester. I had to teach myself everything because anytime I asked questions, he made me feel like an idiot. I went to one office hours once and cried for two hours after contemplating changing my major. SKIP THIS, PROFESSOR!!! | This professor had me teaching myself at home everyday. He is also not understanding. | This teacher does not care about his students! | This professor is extremely rude, he literally calls students out if theyre struggling and will say in front of everyone that the class is doing poorly instead of rendering help. Actually has even lied to a student who attended office hours about giving a test and offered little to no help, so youd have to teach yourself, skip this professor. | Had him for algebra. Decent teacher, pretty much your typical HS math teacher. A few people in my class feel he's condescending but he says things in jest and some take it too seriously. The class is actually kind of difficult. Be prepared to learn something in class and be expected to do homework and study for a quiz on it within 3 days. | I hated this guy. I had him for Elementary Algebra and expected this class to be really easy, but it was not. First of all, he's kind of rude. He's made some students feel stupid for asking questions. He also said this was his worst semester of students. He assigns a TON of homework from the textbook too, but at least he's ok at explaining things."
"Mukherjee, Arun","Professor Mukherjee is overall a great professor, he knew what he was talking about and helps go over anything you need help on. | Very clear and quizzes and exams are easy as long as you pay attention and know the material. Definitely recommend! | Very good professor, his lectures are clear and his quizzes and exams are easy as long as you study or know the information | Took him last year. As many have said here, one of the sweetest and kindest professors you will encounter and have here. His lectures are clear and concise, his explanations are simple enough to understand, and is willing to meet with you outside of class to help you understand the material. Take him, do the work, and you will pass. | His lectures are fairly boring but he is an extremely sweet professor. He accepts late homework and is always willing to help. If you learn through examples, I definitely recommend taking him. | Most helpful professors I have ever had. He moves quickly because there is a lot of material to cover with not a lot of time. Utilize his office hours because he will give you one on one help if necessary. His tests are very simple, as long as you pay attention during lecture. Would recommend taking him for math if you have to choose. | The sweetest professor I've ever had at Rutgers. He answers all your questions and is just so so so nice. He knows his stuff but will go over problems until you fully understand. I wish I could have him for all my math courses! | One of the nicest professors I've ever had. Goes through the material a litlle quickly, but if you pay attention and put in the effort you should be successful. | He is so sweet and I enjoy being in class with him every Mondays and Thursdays. He will help you get through Math. | He's a sweet little guy who is more kind of reserved. He never ever looses his cool and is nice about things even when he fails you, its a F with a smile. He teaches quick because he knows his stuff and pretend math is not that difficult, for me it is the worst :/ | Nice guy but kind of confusing. He moves through the material very quick. Goes through about 4-5 sections a class. Gives off impression like he doesn't know whats going on. Material isnt too difficult but he's not so amazing at explaining. Quiz every 3-4 sections. Test every 3-4 full chapters. Total class rating 3/5."
"Khosla, Noopur","HEAVY accent. does not know how to use an indoor voice. teaching style wasn't for me personally but was helpful for some other people in the class. will get on you about showing up late. every class gave me a headache | She was really helpful in class and prepared us well for quizzes. She also gave me a lot of assistance during office hours! Recommend taking her class. | A bit stern but the way she teaches helped me become a better math student, quizzes were straight forward and explains questions deeply would highly recommend 10/10 | Her encouragement and constructive feedback have helped me become a better student. She preps us very well for quizzes and tests and is always open to answer any questions. | a bit hard to understand but overall okay | Had her for recitation for precalc; if you can't understand people with accents, she has a very heavy accent and talks fast so it can be hard to follow along. quizzes every week; best 10/13 count for final grade. doesn't allow phones or for you to listen to music; she will tell you to get off. she wants you to do the work so you're ready for quiz. | She's pretty good. A little tough but overall cares about students. | Took her as the recitation instructor for both math111 & math112 and she was great both times. goes into detail and teaches pretty clearly before the weekly quiz. She can be pretty dry and blunt and isn't TOO friendly but she's still pretty good. | So, she's not the BEST, but she's not terrible. I will say she has a pretty bad attitude at times, but I thought she was actually really good at explaining the problems and teaching you how to do different problems. I liked her enough that I'm taking her again this semester for precalc 112. She's a bit rude but IMO it was worth her teaching. | Terrible TA, whenever I came to class and asked questions she'd give a nasty look and give the worst possible explanation on how to do the problem. I'd leave class more confused than I was when I came in. She'd act all nice and encourage students to ask questions but she would never actually help you learn. Khan Academy is your best bet. | If you like yourself a tiny bit, then help yourself and just watch youtube videos instead of this joke. She is the worst professor I have ever seen at Rutgers. Her attitude is abysmal and she doesn't care about students at all! If you ask a question, she thinks you are insulting her. Wish I had another prof, but her class was the only one w/ space."
"Nazi, Ghassan","Straight-forward professor. Class time is maximized. Good with emails and super friendly to speak with after class. Simple quizzes once a week. I recommend staying on top of WebAssign assignments, doing each section in alignment with what topic you're learning, and not pushing them to the last minute. | Amazing professor would 100% take again | Actually one of the best math professors out there. He's super nice and chill and makes sures to help you. One time I got a bad quiz grade and Professor Nazi let me retake it. Overall he's actually a good and really nice professor. | Professor Nazi is a very good teacher. Expect a quiz/midterm every Wednesday and there is very few questions that are weighed heavy. There's usually 4 questions that are 5 points each with little to no partial credit. If you talk to him, he is more than understanding to clarify any confusions and give extra help. | I think Professor Nazi's class was easy to understand. I enjoy going to his class and getting ready to learn. He teaches in an easily understood way and helps give tricks on solving the problem. He is helpful even during quizzes and gives us hints when he knows we struggle on a certain topic. I would love to take another of his class. | Professor Nazi helped me understand math more clearly; he gave clear instructions on how to solve problems. I enjoyed his teaching style since it helped me comprehend concepts accessible outside the classroom. He is always willing to help his students. Overall, he is a great professor, and I would take another class with him again! | Prof Nazi is awesome. Attendance isn't mandatory however since it's only two lectures a week I highly recommend you make every single one or you will be behind. Weekly quizzes, however go to office hours and he will give you sample problems to ace every one. Two midterms and one final, if you put in the work you will pass with flying colors. | Professor Nazi is one of the best Professors at Rutgers. He is very accesible and super Nice! He cares about helping his students, and does a lot to help you prepare for all exams. He makes the quizzes easy. He also has an amazing teaching style that helps all the topics stick. 100% Recommended. He made math so much easier to understand for me! | He's really good teacher and explains all the material well. The midterms are very difficult but very similar to the study guides we received. I had to miss one of my midterms and he took over two weeks to get back to me. When he told me to come in he didn't have the midterm. My option was to have my midterm grade come out of my final so I failed. | He is a very nice person who is lenient and answers any questions a person might have. He also goes over topics clearly and smoothly. However, his exams are straight from purgatory itself. They are almost nothing like the reviews or past exams. The exams are very difficult so make sure you study if you are taking one of his courses. Good luck. | Not accessible outside of class(doesn't respond to emails), doesn't allow u to take missed Homeworks(or quizzes/tests), lectures way too fast, and Handwriting barely legible | Took this during COVID. Online synchronous - two lectures per week, hw due each week, 2 quizzes, 2 exams (midterm, final). He's a good teacher, and is kind, and doesn't care how many questions students ask, and makes sure they understand what they're confused with. TA graded harshly on homework so that's the only thing I didn't like. | He's a good professor, very lenient and gives plenty of examples. However, I would say he's fast paced at times and the examples he gives are not like the ones you see on the quizzes and exams. | Professor Nazi really wants his students to succeed. He gives very good explanations and provides a lot of examples. He is easily accessible for extra help, and he also provides very helpful review sessions for exams. | He is a great teacher although teaches a bit fast. He posts all his lectures online. Easy to access outside of class. Do not buy a textbook it is not needed he provides you with everything ! | Easy A. Attendance not mandatory but most classes there's a workshop or quiz that's graded, so show up. Really nice professor, and really cares about students. Always open to questions and gives clear answers. Go to exam reviews and you'll be fine. | Really good professor. Cares about students and makes time to answer questions. Will try to make the course as easy for you as he can. Definitely recommend for harder math courses | Good lectures, has good sense of humor. Showed up to every class early to take questions from students. Definitely a professor who wants everyone to pass. | Don't let my C+ in calc scare you, Prof. Nazi is the man! (I'm just lazy lol) He teaches a bit fast but he is still an amazing teacher who is very willing to help. He's funny, listens, and is VERY reasonable when it comes to what he puts on exams and how he prepares you. Best calc professor in my eyes! Just go to class, it makes such a difference | Professor Nazi is a really amazing lecturer. I had him for Calc 135 and his class was easy as long as you attended lecture and did all the work. He held review sessions for all the exams, and was easy to contact outside of class via email or through office hours. He made lectures fun and really cares about his students succeeding. | Calc I is definitely not easy class at Rutgers, but Professor Nazi did everything he could to make it easier to understand. His lectures were very insightful, and he held multiple review sessions before every exam. He cares about his students, and wants to help them succeed. | Honestly, he is the best Calc prof to have. Make sure you go to all his review sessions before the tests because he gives you example problems which are basically what is on the test with the numbers changed. Ask him questions and he will reveal exactly what is on the test. He is also very good and making you understand. Also has study guides. | Prof Nazi made Calc so enjoyable in my opinion. Despite what the other reviews say, I came straight from Pre-Calc in high school before taking this class and I still ended with a B+. However, it is important to put effort into the class. Show up to class and go to his office hours, he helps out A LOT. | Hands down best professor to take for Calculus at Rutgers. He cares a lot about his students and makes it a point to be accessible to help them succeed in the course. Textbook was not needed, definitely try to attend all/most lectures to do well on the exams. | Professor Nazi is a great guy and wants his students to succeed. Will go through problems until solutions are clear. If you put a little effort and time this should be an easy class. | Prof Nazi is an incredible. He makes himself available to students with office hours weekly & before exams. He also holds additional reviews before exams that many other profs don't. He truly cares about his students and is willing to go the extra mile. he will even help you over email and send solutions to the book that way. Take his class!! | Amazing lecturer if you have already taken AP Calculus in high school. You'll have no problem with this course. Just make sure to attend lecture as there are no online notes. I did not use the textbook at all. He gives plenty of practice problems. Very helpful review sessions. Very fast grader. | Professor Nazi is hands down the best Calculus Professor at Rutgers. He really cares about his students. The exams are not BS & are exactly like the problems he shows in class & he prepares you for it. GO TO HIS REVIEWS OUTSIDE OF LECTURE. You dont need the textbook as long as you practice that problems HE GIVES YOU during lecture & during review! | Professor Nazi is a good professor, no doubt about it. However, he is very fast-paced and is better for people who have already taken Calculus (preferably AP Calculus) in high school. I took Honors Calc and I still get a bit lost in his class despite paying attention to him. His exams are difficult too. Prepare by doing prob's beyond the textbook. | Class is very manageable. Material can be dense some times. Teaching is average. | He is the most amazing calc professor ever! Do not hesitate to take him! :) He made lectures so funny, even at 8:40 in the morning, and REALLY cares about his students doing well! Kudos to him for being the best math professor you will ever have!!"
"Safran, Steven","Overall very nice experience. By-the-books guy & he makes lectures engaging/easy to understand. Show up to class & pay attention & do the homework. Exams are like the reviews, and difficult problems aren't worth that much. He is always willing to offer help and responds fast. The class was easier than I thought it'd be, 100% best precalc 115 prof. | This rating is to the math department. Please Invest more in this pre calc course because webassign homework is just useless as the quiz and tests are not from it. TO SUCEED U LITERALLY ARE FORCED TO USE THAT ONLINE CONFUSING TEXTBOOK. PLEASE USE A PROPER SYSTEM LIKE PEARSON OR SOMETHING. Very unorganized and rushed class! A lot fail! Stay away! | Insanely disorganized. The 3rd midterm, he simply didn't print enough exams, asked a student to find more copies in his office and several people had to end up doing make up exams anyway because there weren't enough copies for everyone. Also disorganized in how he lectures, it felt like 80% rambling and 20% math. Learned more so from the textbook. | Do not take this class if you are somebody who does not like math, trust me. He teaches simple stuff in class but when you get to the HW, Quizzes, and test, it's a whole different ball game. | He's one of the most kind and caring professors I had as a first year. He is patient, makes his lectures engaging by occasionally sharing personal stories, and truly is rooting for all his students to do well. If you're struggling, know that he will be ready to listen and work with you to make a study plan! Definitely take him if you can :) | Professor Safran takes a neutral and stern yet fair approach for most of his sections. With his lectures filled with about 100 people, you must pay attention to and attend lectures to get crucial information for homework and sometimes quizzes and tests. Be sure to visit him during office hours for questions and to gain a relationship with him. | I had him in the summer so ymmv, Professor Safran was by far one of the best professors I have ever had at Rutgers. If you have a question he will go out of his way to explain it with no judgement. There was a ton of homework and quizzes and the class ate up huge chunks of my time just to study for it, but that's more of a 115 problem. Take Safran! | Best professor I've had at Rutgers!! Super nice and will help you until you understand the material. He gives chances to get extra points on quizzes and he is very understanding. Would recommend!! 10/10. | Best professor I've had at Rutgers. Great at teaching and explaining, incredibly nice, keeps lecture engaging. Gives a lot of homework but its forces you to learn the material really well. Course was time-consuming and deeply rewarding, but not that difficult if you put in enough time. You likely won't do well if you don't attend lecture. | He is straight forward teacher, with no beating around the bush. He does not go on tangents that often. From my experience, he is good at explaining to and patient when clarifying questions. overall good teacher. | I like his teaching style, he simplifies the topic and slowly makes them harder so we don't lose the general concept we've been taught. Often gives opportunity to earn extra points on recitation quizzes | He talked so incredibly slow it's hard to pay attention. Spends too much time on easy topics, and not enough on the really difficult ones + crams a lot of info in days before the final. Overall he was a great person, but teaching style was not the best, I learned most of it from youtube and friends. But there much worse professors for this course. | Coach Safran is overall a really good professor.There are 12 weekly quizzes that occur during the end of recitation, however your two lowest grades do get dropped. The quizzes are not difficult, however, you do need to understand the material in order to pass because sometimes there are some trick questions. | Very friendly and a great professor. He simplifies everything and makes it more understandable. Take him if you can. However, you HAVE to go to lecture if you want to pass, or else you're screwed. It's not too bad tho he makes it fun. If you focus in class you can easily pass the class. | I don't recommend taking him because he makes the lecture heavy and you will not get anything from the lecture. Quizzes are long and difficult and have complicated problems in tests. Also, you take a lot of topics in one lecture. | Class was pretty hard, but Coach Safran was great. You'd have to really set aside time outside of class to do well. Lots of homework and quizzes every week. | Quiz every single recitation. Quizzes and exams are very difficult and don't align with the skill level you are prepared for during class and homework. Lectures move fast but that makes sense. Only thing is he skips over a lot of crucial in between steps. Willing to help but the help isn't very helpful. | The hardest thing Ive ever take. He is a very bad professor. His tests are extremely hard and nothing like his review or lectures. Avoidddd him he is gonna let u hate yr life | Professor Safran, although he is kind and nice, his lectures were no help. My TA better explained it than the actually professor. His exams are nothing like the review and he gives vague answers to questions that are asked. | Coach Safran was such a wholesome teacher. He was so nice and i really like how he would get students involved on the regular, taking this class online while still being interactive really helped me in learning the material. He also goes at the the students pace, making sure we understand. One of the only good math professors i've had :) | Precalc at Rutgers is hard, but Safran made it easy. He was clear, knew what he was doing, and made the class go by quite fast because of his ability to interact with the students. The exams can be a bit difficult in terms of the wording, but nothing impossible. If you feel otherwise, Safran is fair and will listen to your concerns. | Mr. Safran, although a bit difficult in regards to tests, is an amazing professor. He works with students to make sure they excel in class, helps locate resources, and tries his best to always accommodate students needs. I would definitely take him again. | He was very good at breaking down concepts and giving students multiple ways to solve problems. I remember he helped me work through the hw after class when I didn't understand it once, so that was really helpful. Sometimes he got upset at petty things like students sleeping or coming in late. ""Folks, that's just the way it operates"" - Prof. Safran | Nice guy who wants to help, but he is inconsistent and ultimately requires you to teach yourself. Inconsiderate and overall just a miserable class | Professor Safran for Precalc is an overall good professor. Notes are everything, he knows how to present the material and make it that everyone could understand. | I took Prof Safran for spring 2020 semester and I was rally scared because I heard this was one of the most difficult classes at rutgers. While the class was difficult, Prof saran made it very bearable. He is such a sweet guy, who is always cracking jokes, and in a good mood. I really enjoyed his lectures and teaching style. I highly recommend him! | Yes,I know math is hard but as a transfer student who is taking precalc for second time, I can say that Safran's way of explaining the material is not so helpful for those who aren't into math. I used my old notes to pass. Safran is a nice old man except the fact that he crazily yelled at a student in front of 50(+) others for lookin his cellphone | Professor Safran is amazing. He wants everyone of his students to succeed and is always there to help. Super flexible with his office hours, staying after class to answer questions, and you can easily set up a meeting time for extra help as well. PreCalculus in general is a tough class at Rutgers, but he makes it a lot better. | Passed the class, but he made the class feel tense as he would say things such as ""you guys wont pass if you dont know"". It wasn't very helpful in improving the way we feel, which could help the way we learn. Also talks really quickly and hand writing is a mess... Anyone else honestly | Precalc is a really hard subject at Rutgers but I'm really happy I took it with Safran. Going to his office hours help a lot and once he knows your face and knows you're trying, he tries to help you. He always made jokes in class and tried to boost peoples moods. He really is a good but fast-paced teacher | Prof Safran does his best to teach one of the harder subjects at Rutgers. I went to every office hour and never regretted it because he truly cares and will walk you through each problem. I am not good at math so I finished with a D but if you have to take this class, take it with Safran! Go to class, office hours, and study! You have to work hard | Safran may not look like the nicest guy but he genuinely cares about his students. I never went to his office hours but people who did go said that going to him after class helped them boost their grade a lot. I took precalc in high school and I got an A but DO NOT under estimate Safran's class!!!! I thought I could ace his class too but I got a D. | Precalculus is a hard course at Rutgers. I definitely struggled in the beginning but with Safran's help, the curve and hard work I was able to pass. In order to do well in this class you have to attend class and definitely go to office hours. He is always available and willing to help. He is also funny so his class becomes more enjoyable. | This pre calc class is known to be difficult, but he is the best teacher to have for it. He is always willing to help and is accessible outside of class. Overall he gives great lectures and is pretty funny. He also gave me a motivational pep talk once, and I think that is part of the reason I didn't fail the class. STUDY A LOT | He is the best math teacher. He has made precalc so much easier than expected. He is very kind and provides many resources and ways to help improve. Precalc will be easier with him as your professor. Definitely utilize his office hours because he rewards people that put in the extra work. | In Precalc 115, Safran teaches fast to make sure everything's covered. He asks a lot of questions and picks on random students in class to make sure everyone's paying attention and understands what's going on. He's cracks a good amount of jokes and is overall a great professor. I wouldn't want anyone else at RU to teach me math. | Pre-calc is a hard subject and Safran is a decent way to get through it in one semester. He is pretty approachable but he has a very good way of intimidating you. Just put in the work outside of class and don't let his comments affect you. | I thought he was really good. Requires decent amount of work. he clearly knows what he is talking about. Get help if you need it. Good at explaining. I thought class was easy cause I'm good at math but if I'm being objective for average student its probably a little tough but doable. Attend each class. Favorite quote""Thats how it does uhhh operate"" | Ok not sure where the hate is coming from. Scary at first but you'll see he is a very nice human actually. The class is tough; however, he is great at explaining. Go to class, pay attention. Office hours are important. I think the TA's (Milman) were even more valuable. He slightly tweaks concepts for the exams. If you trulyunderstandityoull do well | Worst class i have ever taken. Went to every lecture, did all the homework, did well on quizzes, yet i failed all of the exams. He just makes the exams impossible. Many people failed in my class. He is really intimidating and makes exam questions nothing like what you have done in class before... save your GPA and don't take him... | He doesn't call himself Coach for nothing. Professor Safran really coaches and guides students through the depths of precalculus. The class is extremely difficult and moves at a very accelerated pace, but Prof Safran really makes an effort to make himself available to students. Take advantage of office hours, you'll need them! | Love him so much! My favorite professor at Rutgers so far. Cares so much about his students and will take the time out of his day to ensure that you are on the right track and understand everything. Although precalc 115 is hard in general, he tries to make it as easy as possible. Attend lectures and do the homework and you'll be set! | I love professor Safran. I failed PC115 last semesters with Lindboe and now I have him and im doing amazing! Hes a great person and cares about how you do in the class. I recommend if youre struggling go to his office hours. | This class is very VERY hard .. but without this professor I do not think I would stand a chance .. This course is expedited (2 classes in 1) and he flies thru chapters .. assigns a ton of homework (webassign 3-4 per week) .. but overall he truly cares and wants you to succeed .. quizzes are tough / exams are brutal .. work hard and u can pass tho | Honestly really cares about you doing well. Go to extra help the class and curriculum is Hard in itself but he is a really good teacher. He gets the base of the problem works on material starting from deep within and works his way out to give you the best understanding. He's also hilarious and makes class interesting. Great guy | Wow. Professor warns students in the beginning that only 2-4% of people receive As in his class. Pre Calc is a tough class at Rutgers, but this class was nearly impossible. Lectures are clear and fairly easy, but homework, quizzes, and exams are incredibly difficult. He truly does care &is willing to help, but I would avoid this class at all costs. | Coach Safran cares about his students and helps out as much as he can. Precalc is one of the toughest courses at Rutgers, but he helps you understand the material. Make sure to do the homework. If you do well on quizzes, you should be fine on exams. He likes calling on people in class, so be prepared to answer basic math questions. | Coach Safran (as he likes to be called) is a caring man who will help you to understand the concepts of PreCalc in anyway he can. The lectures are helpful for the homework and quizzes. If you do well on quizzes more than likely you'll do well on the exam. Lectures are interactive and coach expects fast answers to basic math questions | His lectures were super interactive and very clear + to the point. In the lecture he goes through problems that will probably come on the hw and the quiz. Very accessible in office hours and super sweet in them too. If you want to pass, attend every lecture and go to office hours. It definitely is work but honestly made math enjoyable. | This professor really puts in the effort and is really accessible. Pre calc requires you work hard and study but if you do that, he'll do everything to help you be successful. He drops your worst 2 quiz grades and announces exam dates which prepare you very well for the final. | Professor Safran is one of the best professors that I've had at Rutgers. Precalc is a tough course at Rutgers but he makes it fun and shows that he really does want all of his students to do well. Attending all lectures and going to office hours will definitely help your grade. | Prof Safran is very helpful. He is good at teaching, he will answer all of your questions and if you can't make it to office hours he will make time for you to make sure you understand the material. He tells the dates of the quizzes and exams in advance and drops the lowest quiz. He asks questions to make sure everyone participates and understands | A couple of first impressions: if you don't like being put on spot i recommend not taking the class with him. He points to random students for answers and it's a pressured environment. This may be a good or bad thing depending on the type of person you are. He's also very messy n disorganized. Personally, I like traditional lectures. | This guy made fun of a student who clearly had asthma my class. A real piece of work. | Professor Safran is amazing! His method of teaching helps students who just cannot 'do' math. He prepares you well for the quizzes and exams and final. He cares a lot about his students and tries to work around schedule's of students by opening office hours almost every day. Go to office hours if you have any problem since he goes over them slowly. | Professor Safran is one of the most amazing professors at Rutgers. His lectures are very interesting and he encourages class participation. He is always accessible outside class and is very helpful with the homework during his office hours. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS! Overall, he's a fair grader and a very respected professor at Rutgers. | Took him for 5 weeks in the summer. 60 on my first exam, 75 on my second, and an A on my final. Failed almost all of my quizzes. Went to office hours constantly--he's willing to teach and work with you if you're willing to show you care. the exams are easier than the quizzes, so master them &youll be good. he wants you to succeed | The class itself is challenging but Prof Safran is great. Very approachable, great at explaining the material, and always willing to help you when you need it. The work is tough but really didn't mind this class at all -- very well respected professor. | Took precalc in highschool. Took it again. The class was easy enough and he was a really cool teacher. Was very thorough with examples and didn't make teaching complicated. Just study and you'll do fine. | Took his precalc part I over the summer. Definitely had to work hard and study even though I took precalc in high school. He was very respected with a great personality and made the class interesting. He was a really great professor I recommend him. | Professor Safran is one of my favorite professors. He is willing to help students out, you just have to make the effort and go to office hours. I also love how he teaches. He has great stories and he's really funny. This class will be a piece of cake if you do all your work and actually communicate with him. | Safran is the man. Great professor and always willing go give help. His office hours really helped me. Like any pre calc 135 class expect work. Definitely need to put in effort in this class | The pace of the class is very fast, but if you pay attention and go to every lecture you'll pass. GO TO OFFICE HOURS, he really wants to help the students be successful and if you work for the grade you can get an A. | Absolutely love him, hands down best math professor I have ever had. He's not an easy A or an easy professor, but if you do your work practice and study you can easily pass this class. He is amazing at explaining everything, he actually teaches you the material you won't have to teach yourself. | Safran was amazing! He is really there for you when you need help, and makes sure everyone understands. If you don't put in the effort to do well, he won't try and help you. Overall had a great fall semester with him, even if I didn't get the grade I would have liked! | Professor Safran manages to teach the course in a very understandable manner. He gives students all of the tools needed to do well. As long as a student goes to class, takes notes, and seeks one on one help, a reasonable grade will be earned. He wants his students to succeed and he will help you out if you just ask. | This class is very fast paced and you have to be willing to put the work in. Professor Safran is very helpful and I recommend going to his office hours if you are struggling. Exam difficulty is moderate but if you study, you should do fine. | If you think you can handle pre cal and have never taken it before , do not take safran avoid him you will fail. he explains a easy problem then hits you with an extremely difficult one on the exam. he will not explain he will skip steps and he will not give you the attention a person who has not taken precal before needs. | Professor Safran is a REALLY good teacher! I was worried registering for the accelerated Pre-Cal because its known to be super tough but if your good at algebra and your willing to put in the EXTRA work, you'll succeed. I highly recommend going to his office hours and if there is something you don't understand do not be afraid to ASK FOR HELP! | If you have to take math 115 at Rutgers, take it with him. Go this lectures, go to the front row, take notes and do his reviews. If you work diligently, you should get at least a 'B.'"
"Benedict, Krista","Honestly the best math teacher I have had in a while. She explains topics thoroughly, and makes sure you will be prepared for exams by providing resources and practice questions. | Best math teacher ever! | She is an awesome teacher!! Very nice and caring for all of her students. | shes super sweet. im a weak algebra student but she helped me understand majority of the material. although she posts her lectures i recommend attending always. quizzes were relatively easy and she gives partial credit. enjoyable class although i hate math. she is very understanding and helpful. strongly recommend | she is one of the nicest and most helpful teachers i have ever had. always makes sure to explain things and answers questions when you have them. the weekly quizzes are easy and she always reviews before taking the quiz. best math teacher i have ever had. | Overall she was really nice and a good teacher but only if you asked questions. Her quizzes were very short and easy. However, during lectures she went really fast and no one in class ever asked questions so it was hard to learn. but she records all of her lectures and posts them if you go back and watch. | She is so sweet! Genuinely feels like she cares about each student. She WANTS things to make sense and will ask many times if she needs to solve down/ if students are understanding the material. SHES THE BEST! | LOVE HER if i could take her for my other classes, i would. Super caring and helpful, accessible outside of class hours. Overall an amazing professor. | Amazing professor that cares about her students, will help you with anything! Going to have alot of quizzes, but she reviews the content right before the quiz and always reminds you the class prior you're never blindsided. There's homework assigned at the end of each class, but she goes over problems anyone has trouble with before you turn it in. | I love this woman I took this class 2 times before her and she made it stick I would have got a B in the class but I got a c on the final first exam I didn't study and got a c second exam I got a 68 but material gets harder second exam. I went to every office hour. she will explain it to you no problem. the quizzes& exams are easy. ask for help !!! | Professor Benedict is amazing, and as a person who hates math, she really made me feel as though I could do it! She goes quickly in class, but is always willing to help in office hours. She is very understanding, and just an all around nice woman! She made me feel more comfortable with math 100%. | Amazing professor. Office hours are your best friend, and her tests, homework, and exams are very clear. She will sit with you to make sure you understand the material. overall really really good, sweet, and willing to work with students. 10/10 | By far the best professor I have ever had. She knows how to explain things in a way that is very clear and concise. She gives us all of the tools and examples we need to be able to learn and is always ready to help. She is incredibly kind and is the first woman who showed me that I can actually do math & enjoy it. Take her if you have the option!! | She is the best professor i've had at rutgers!! She gives plenty of examples and always goes over the homework. She will always answer questions clearly until you understand. Hands down the sweetest professor I've had here. | I really liked her she was such a sweet teacher. She goes through the lessons very quick but she goes over the homework and explains it well and wants you to show up to office hours for help. Her quizzes and exams are exactly what she teaches. Very smart professor | One of the best math teachers i've had!! She wants you to succeed and she'll give tons of examples in class so you understand. The homework is a GRADE. BOOSTER. DO IT. She does hw problems if asked to, but do not take her for granted and think she'll just do your homework for you. If she has to do too many problems to do, she removes the assignment | Best math teacher I've ever had at Rutgers. Had to take this class three times. She gives you lots of examples, so go to class and take good notes! She's so helpful and kind and does whatever she can to make the class easy. If I could take her for every math class, I would. | Extremely helpful, truly cares about you understanding the material and doing well. Show up to class, and do all the homework. Super nice teacher, take her!! | Prof Benedict is a pretty good math professor. Shes super nice and fairly easy. She sometimes goes a little overboard with examples but its for your own good. Attendance is mandatory and she gives 2 tests, 1 final, and 4-5 quizzes. Homework is graded so make sure you do it. Overall, just your avg math class and professor. | great teacher, take math with her. she's extremely helpful | She's a great teacher - she made the concepts easy to understand and she's super patient. As long as you show that you're trying, she will do as much as she can to help you. Attend class, pay attention, do your homework and you'll pass. | Professor Benedict is tremendously helpful. She is aware that this isn't most people's interest and is very patient with us. As with any course, you have to do the homework to do well. She is very matter of fact in lectures. She gets down to what you really need to know. She is very nice and I recommend her."
"Lopes, Denise","I took Mathematics of Money with the knowledge that the class is an easy A. I did indeed get an A, but it took a lot more effort than what I expected. There are HWs and quizzes every week. I highly recommend attending office hours or reaching out to Professor Lopes to check HWs because they are graded on correctness. Overall, great professor. | Shes a great teacher dont get me wrong but I think online for this class wasnt the best option. It was a struggle to pay attention to class. | Lopes is a good math professor. I hate math and am not the best at it but she made it easy to learn. I recommend taking it with her! | Professor Lopes is extremely understanding and does everything in her power to make sure you succeed. I took a hybrid course and she explained the material so much better than the videos/textbook. ALSO, the textbook is available on Sakai for free!!! She is a great professor, I would definitely take her again if given the chance."
"Vaksman, Sofia","Flipped classroom style of learning, had to do videos before each class. Some videos were an hour or longer, some were shorter. In-class assignments each class and a quiz at the end of each class. 2 exams and a final. She's sweet and genuinely wants every one of her students to do well, but it is very easy to fall behind. | Really sweet professor who really wants to help you learn. Easy A if you come to class and pay attention. People have said her accent is too thick, but it must have gotten better. Take this for an easy A cuz there are only 2 exams and a final (cumulative) but they are pretty easy. If you do well, you can get a C on the final and end with an A. | Yes, she has an accent, but honestly, it's not that hard to understand her. The course material isn't hard as long as you attend class and take good notes. There are weekly videos that aren't difficult but very tedious. She's a kind professor who tries her best. | She is a very sweet person and cares about her students. She is occasionally hard to understand and can confusingly expain the topics. It was very helpful to have a teacher's assistant and friends in the class. Overall she was a good professor that I would take again | This professor is such a sweet lady and works very hard to get to know her students but teacher wise, she is just not good. Very heavy accent and doesn't speak loudly so she's hard to understand. 2 mid-terms and a cumulative final which can be rough if you don't study. Only good thing is that she is a pretty lenient grader but def avoid taking her. | Professor Vaksman is such a sweet, caring professor. She always makes sure that you fully understand the material and always goes over it if you are having trouble. Yes she has an accent, but I honestly got used to it and it wasn't a problem. I had the class twice a week, and it was a decent amount of work (no homework), but normal for a math class | Heavy accent, but sweet and helpful with questions. Quiz every class, exams are challenging because there's an obnoxious amount of info on them. Flipped classroom is rough because she doesn't teach in class, just goes over slides and practice problems (mainly teaching ourselves). | I thought she was wonderful. You learn material for homework, review in class, and quiz at the end of every class. Group/partner work every class. The style of teaching worked for me. Open to answering questions in and out of class. The more you participate the faster you will learn the material. Has an accent and talks quietly, sit in the front. | Flipped classroom, learned material for hmwk. Was a pain but prob for the best, she isn't the greatest at explaining things. Lots of reviews mention her accent; I nvr had a problem w/ it. She's very sweet and tries to help as much as possible. Attendance matters as there's a quiz every class. Class doesn't rly help much if u understand the material | Do NOT take math with Vaksman. She is nice (most of the time) but has an extremely heavy accent that you will NOT understand, and speaks quietly on top of that. She will not understand your questions well enough to answer them. She frequently makes mistakes while teaching which leads to everyone being confused and her tests all have errors. | Vaksman is nice. But her accent is a bit difficult to understand. What saved her was her recitation instructor. Don't get me wrong, she tried her best, but she can be difficult when it comes to actually trying to explain something. I wouldn't take her again, but I'd advise you to try and find a better prof - but if you have no other choice its fine | Took this to fulfill a math requirement. There are many, many HW assignments as well as quizzes every week. If you get points off on those, you're basically behind. The tests consist of a few lengthy questions (multiple parts). Vaksman wants you to succeed yet she read off of ppts and calls you out in front of the class if you did bad on a quiz. | Professor Vaksman's math of money class is definitely rough work wise, but she does care. She is a very kind and caring woman. I personally had multiple problems throughout the semester and she was very good with helping me and was very kind. Wouldn't take it again because of the difficulty, but she is very kind. | Class is SUPER light if you have a good mathematics foundation, but do not take it with Vaksman. She is so bad at explaining the lessons and most of the time the information on her power points are wrong. She hates to admit her mistakes, so she'd rather give you the wrong information. The homework is easy but tedious."
"Arias, Cecilia","Math is difficult for me but Prof Arias was very understanding and supportive and went above and beyond to help me. She never gave up on me. She is one of the kindest professors I've ever had. Prof Arias cares deeply about her students and you feel it and know it. I'd take her again in a heartbeat. | Out of all my years of school, I can honestly say that I've maybe had 2 or 3 other teachers or professors that even hold a candle to how amazing Professor Arias is. She genuinely cares so much about her students succeeding and the way that she is willing to go above and beyond for her students is truly extraordinary. Best professor ever. | Best math professor, could not reccommend more. SO kind and caring, helps during exams, extends office hours to help, give extensions on homework and quizzes, lets you work together during quizzes, always accesible and extremely helpful through email. She is the reason I passed math this sem and I am forever grateful. 100000/10 teacher truly a gem | She's really good at teaching math, especially for someone like me who's not good at math. She's also a caring professor and is always willing to help her students. | I love Professor Arias so much! She was so sweet and caring and genuinely wanted all her students to succeed in the class. We just went over homework every class, had partner quizzes, and a few in-person exams. I'm not a math person but she made learning so fun and easy. Definitiely recommend taking a class with her. | Had her for Math112 recitation. Nicest Professor I have ever had. Very caring and will go above and beyond to explain something you may not understand. Gives partial credit, grades fair. She wants everyone to succeed. | Dr. Arias is awesome! She's honestly one of the best communicating professors there is and she makes herself available whenever you need to ask questions about the material. She tries her best to adapt to your way of learning so you better understand the material so don't be afraid to ask for help! | took the preofessor arias this fall. very difficult class and no extra credit | Easy GPA boosting class. | Good professor who explains the material clearly | Best professor at Rutgers, and she's actually knows what she's doing and is great at teaching. Always willing to help, responds fast and gives good feedback. Took this class from 9 -10:40 pm and it was worth it. Gives partial/extra credit on exams. Go to class, pay attention, and ask questions. Actually made me want to learn and was so supportive. | OMG Prof. Arias is motherrr!! I admit that I failed the first exam. So for the rest of the semester, I made sure to ask for help during class. You could ask for her help 10x during class and she will gladly answer your questions. She makes her exams straightforward. It's not meant to trip you up unlike the math department homework sheet. | I absolutely love prof Arias...she is one of the nicest professors I've had. You work with partners which is really helpful...tests are open notes. She actually wants her students to do well and get a good grade. Friends had other profs for this class and hated it...if you can take her do it! Def take 103 to fulfill your SAS requirement | Such a nice lady. Take her if your hesitant. | Love her! One downfall I had was that she didn't teach the material herself, and had us watch canvas lectures on our own, which I wasn't a huge fan of. However, she is always there when you have a question. I SUCK at math and did pretty well. Def a great class and prof to meet ur SAS requirements. | Took a hybrid version of math 103 with her during the Fall 2021 semester. I would definitely recommend this class with her if you are trying to fulfill your SAS core math requirement. It's pretty easy, the homework can take a while sometimes but it's not hard and all the exams were open note. She's super nice and helpful. | Amazing professor. Just do her work and you'll pass the class. her exams and quizzes are open notes. She also assigns an extra credit project which helps immensely. She's understanding and loves to help her students. | Prof. Arias was an awesome instructor! Take her if you ever get the chance, especially for math 103 or 106 which can be a bit confusing. She also has great taste in music and is always smiling. | I love Prof Arias so much. This semester she let me do my homework in office hours so I could check my work with her, and I've never done so well in a math class before. She's really sweet and helpful, and the kind of teacher that believes in you so much you try harder just to not let her down. I wish she taught more classes I could take. | I cannot express how amazing Dr. Arias is!! She is so friendly & genuinely cares so much about her students. She devotes so much time to helping students and makes office hours really accessible. Even though I took this class online, she made it a really nice interactive environment. Seriously my favorite professor I've ever had! | Such an awesome prof. She seems to really care about her students and really wants them to just pass. She does an awesome job explaining the concepts and the work load is definitely manageable. Records lectures and posts notes. She replies relatively quickly to emails and is also super trendy. | Professor Arias shows a lot of care towards her students and will always help figure out problems in the homework or class questions by allocating time in the beginning of class or after class. She assigns a short quiz every Thursday and a homework once a week which is very manageable and helps you practice in preparation for the 3 exams. | Cecilia is a very caring professor who helps everyone shine to their full potential. It's an easy course and she most certainly makes it enjoyable. However, do not buy the textbook, it's useless! Take her though! | Cecilia is the G.O.A.T. She is a must have professor who will stop at nothing to get you an A. She is very caring, her work is easy though there is a weekly quiz where you can work in a group to complete. Exams are decently challenging, but our second exam she let us do test corrections and gave us more credit on that one. Overall Awesome Prof! | Extremely nice professor, for an extremely easy class. She gives a decent amount of homework, but it does help on the test. She gives a quiz at the end of every week, but allows it to be done with a partner. She will give you hints on exams if you ask. Will help with quizzes as well. Drops 3 lowest homework grades and 2 lowest quiz grades. | The class had eleven people so if you skip its noticeable but she doesn't take attendance. The material is super dry and she isn't the best at making it much more exciting, but she brings in snacks to work with sometimes so that was cool. I expected to learn how to teach algebra but I didn't. She is super flexible around what students need/can do | Amazing wonderful angel. Im TERRIBLE at math and I still have a high A in the class. Makes sure EVERYONE fully understands the material before moving on. Group quizzes weekly are super easy and even fun. Offers help with weekly hw assignments too. Drops the lowest 2 hw and lowest 2 quiz grades. Super nice, helpful and REALLY wants us to succeed. | She was really easy to reach outside of class. Theres also lots of grades like weekly homework and quizzes. It is not too bad though material wise. The quizzes were also fairly easy as long as you look over the material. | Professor Arias really cares about her students and it shows. If you ever need additional help, she is almost always accessible via email or office hours. The material was not too bad either. Only exam exams and weekly homework assignments. The assignments were long but the exams were not too bad. | She was my recitation instructor and she would give super easy quizzes (which definitely helps your grade in that class). She was nice, but she also did the questions different than the professor so it got SUPER confusing sometimes because I often couldn't put two and two together as to what was happening. | She was an overall good professor, however the last section of material on growth and finance was difficult and rushed. We did not have time to review much for the final, which ends up being much more difficult than the other exams. However despite this, I still would take her again. Weekly quizzes, three exams and weekly homework assignments. | Fantastic TA. Clarifies anything the professor has not properly explained during class. 2-3 question quizzes at the end of each recitation are collaborative and often have verbatim problems that we've already covered. | She's super great | Amazing professor! Cares about her students, great at clarifying any questions students have. Extremely helpful in office hours as well. If you have a decent math background this class should be vey easy as long as you do the hw problems. | Professor Arias is the best math professor I have ever had in my entire life. She loves what she does, she goes above and beyond for her students whenever they do not understand a concept. She is very understanding when it comes to having a personal emergency. Cant say one bad thing about her. shes so great it inspires you to do well! | Kindest professor I've had at Rutgers. Had her for math for the liberal arts and mathematics of money. Understanding, accommodating and super sweet. Exams are easy and she understands that we are non-math majors. | Sweetest professor ever!! One of the nicest professors I've had. | Great class, easy, fair grader, we go over practice problems during class. You go to class and learn how to do the problem then do a short homework once a week that takes 5 minutes. The tests are exactly like the homework and she is an easy grader, giving points everywhere she can. Attendance isnt really mandatory or non-mandatory I just go."
"Ross, Arianne","Overall great professor. Everything was clear and understandable in my experience. Flipped Classroom, did an online video every Sunday, classwork done in groups twice a week, and a quiz on topic of the week. She cares about her students, and is dedicated to her work. | Prof. Ross helped me love math. I came from a community college so I was worried but she made it easy. I hope to take her again! | Awful! I'm not great at math but this class felt impossible. I've taken a handful of maths here and this was the worst. I regret not withdrawing early in the semester. | Wouldn't recommend taking her, insanely fast at teaching, doesn't slow down, immense amouts of work, just dreaded this class. Don't take her | Disliked by much of the class. Gives too much homework and is not very good at explaining things clearly and concisely. Makes mistakes fairly often aswell."
"Roemer, Cynthia","Don't take her at all. Very lazy and doesn't teach. Tests are worth a lot. This was for algebra, and it was impossible to learn the way she expected you to learn. Watch videos at home and do homework in class, and it's a lot of work. | Professor Roemer uses the flipped classroom structure, where you watch lectures on your own time and then complete homework, quizzes and tests in class. You can double check answers in class for the hw so it is easy to get full credit. Tests and quizzes are hard but Roemer has plenty of office hours to help. She is very understanding and nice. | Highly recommend taking math of lib arts with professor Roemer. She utilizes a flipped classroom and the bulk of your work is done in class with a group. The math itself is not very hard and she is more than willing to explain things and provide help. She is a tough grader, but the material itself is not hard to understand | I am currently in the process of finishing Math103; Topics in Mathematics for Liberal Arts, and words cannot express how helpful Professor Roemer was this semester. She is a very compassionate and understanding individual, very accessible outside of class, and really shows dedication in wanting to see you succeed. I cannot recommend her enough. | Dr. Roemer is an amazing professor. I took her 103 class last summer and I really enjoyed it. She gives good feedback and helps us. I don't know why others put bad reviews here. | Only 350 characters to describe the worst professor I've had at Rutgers is not enough (sorry but its true). Grades HW brutally. You will learn more from textbook than lecture. Exams will make you cry. Way too fast paced for a 100 class. Do not take this class for credit or with her because you will get a B if jesus christ himself blesses you. HELP | This class is beyond difficult. She doesn't know what she's doing, messes up almost every single class. If your connection is a bit slow and you get into class late for 30 seconds, she will mark you late. Planning on taking her class? I suggest you RUN. | Her lectures make the material sound easy. Then she hits you with the hardest homework questions that werent a part of the lecture and gives you a 0 if you get them slightly wrong. She will give you some credit if you are blessed by an angel. And on top of all of that, I kind of find her to be quite rude at times. do not take her class for credit | Very shocked with the negative rates. Took her 3 summers back. Came to class to basically do the homework which was long/boring. Everything is graded and submitted to the department so she does not have a say in grading. Material is 8th-grade level. Had to watch the department videos since it was a flipped classroom yet she broke things down more | It was so hard trying to learn anything in this class! Whenever I tried asking any questions or meeting with her it was practically impossible to get an answer out of her. I was expecting it to be a fun enjoyable class, but she ended up making it difficult and annoying. | She's an absolutely terrible professor. AN easy class recommended by friends turned into my lowest grade at school. Do not take her she's a horrible grader, horrible selfish person and waste of time professor"
"Milman, Yevgeniy","A very good professor. I think he's a PhD student, but has a broad knowledge in anything related to numerical methods. Liked his class very much. The HW were easy. All HW were computer based . I think the material wasn't hard either, just follow his instructions and go to class! this class should be an easy A for those who try for a little. | Worst thing about the class is that there is no textbook. Class was very late at night and the professor did a good job explaining complicated (for me) concepts. | Absolutely horrendous teaching skills.Neither clear nor helpful.Barely checked Hw or took attendance.Difficult to understand accent. Not worth the $. Didn't learn a thing from him.He's also not actually a teacher, won some math awards so was asked to teach.He understands the material & just rambles on not caring if you understand anything.ATROCIOUS | he is good at teahing. he does a good preparation before coming to teach us. his exams are fine, but definitely can get over 80 if u do the practice. I got A+ | He was difficult with coursework and hw, but was willing to help most of the time. Somedays he seemed to fluster, other days he kept babbling. He gave 1 midterm and final and tons of hw all time consuming. he tells you what will be on the exam but didn't find the review helpful. showed us his masters work, so he seems to know enough of the subject. | after all that work, he gave me a bad grade. he picks his favorites and those idiots laughing at his stupid jokes like a hyena didnt help either. should've taken roitberg. he thinks too much of himself and will only pass students he likes, gives too many hw ques and his exams are killers! he had a sub come in for an exam while he went and did w.e. | Oh my god, he is an awesome professor and he is very available for private tutoring. Plus he is nice to watch | Mr. Milman is very helpful and nice. He will answer all your questions and seems to care for all of his students. Exam have partial credit. Mr. Milman's knowledgeable and patient. Gives a break in the middle of class. He gives you what you need to know for the exams, but you have to study on your own too! I highly recommend Mr. Milman. | Mr. Milman is a good professor. His exams are difficult and he expects a lot, but he will show you everything you need to know. Mr. Milman is nice and caring, and approachable. He talks in class a lot and tries his best to explain through the accent, but he's good."
"Sergel, Emily","While the class is tough, Professor Sergel provides great lectures and clear methods to follow to construct proofs effectively. Her grading is relatively lenient. Make use of her office hours and ask many questions. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience and a better professor, it was a pleasure taking a class with her. | Professor Sergel is by far the best math professor I have had at Rutgers. She simplifies complicated topics into digestible, easy-to-understand lessons and clearly puts a lot of effort into her lectures to make them engaging and interesting. Lectures are mandatory and reading assignments are due before class; exams are extremely fair. | Professor Sergel was an amazing teacher! She was very caring, passionate, and always helped when I asked. She will always address any problem you are struggling with. This class consisted of a lot assignments and mid-terms, however, do not panic. These assignments do not let you fall behind and the exams are very fair. | Prof Sergel is a great teacher who has good ways of teaching calculus. I never understood math more easily in any other class. Take Prof Serfel's Math 151 class if you want to pass with an A and feel like you earned it. | The absolute sweetest professor. I took her worried I would fail and she helped me SO much. She never judges and she's open to answering questions. Even when she would fall sick, she would still hold office hours and come teach. She's a fair grader. Unfortunately, she went on leave after a month into the semester but she is the BEST. Take her!! | Professor Sergel's lectures were so easy to follow and overall she made sure all of her students thoroughly understood the topics. If you are new to Calculus or feel like you need a really strong knowledge of Calculus Professor Sergel will do that for you. | Emily is totally enthusiastic to math, she responds to every question you have. Therefore, I asked series of questions when I found something confused during the lecture. Plus, she is a good grader and gives a lot of support and encouragement to students. | Attendance was mandatory and contributed to heavy participation grade. Constant assignments due whether it was reading assignments, long homework, weekly quizzes, weekly submitted group work, etc. Homework will say three questions and then its part A. part b. part c for all of them. Put out polls then didnt listen to feedback. | TEST AND SAPLING HOMEWORK IS REALLY HEAVY, BUT IS A BRILLIANT TEACHER THAT MAKES ME ADDICT TO MATH. REALLY A LOUD VOICE THAT EVERYONE IN THE LECTURE HALL CAN HEAR WHAT SHE WANTS TO TEACH US. | Emily Sergel is a good professor. Basically, you should not have any fear going into this class if you are serious about passing with a good grade. She is friendly and committed to answering questions if you have them. My grade frankly isn't a reflection on how she is as a professor. If I had done things differently on my end I would've gotten an A"
"Sherwood, Deborah","Took Professor Sherwood at UNF and by far the most caring, patient, and overall wonderful educator I've had. She makes sure everyone is caught up before moving on and has no problem repeating herself. Math is not my best subject but she made it very understanding and enjoyable. Take her if possible, you WON'T regret it! | At UNF. Outstanding mathematics professor. Thoroughly explains complex concepts, although fast passed, she's always willing to slow down if you speak up. Grade based on tests, quizzes, and attendance only. Always holds office hours and flexible to meet for extra help. Provides all the tools you need to succeed if you show up ready to learn. | Professor Sherwood is a great professor, I really don't know why her ratings aren't great too. Her lectures were the most important part of the class, but I didn't always attend them live, so I always watched them after, since they were recorded. Exams in total are 80 percent of the final grade, but keep up and prepare and it will be fine | AWESOME teacher. I wish I could have her again. EXTREMELY nice and patient. will explain it multiple ways for you to get it. Honestly the best teachers I've had at Rutgers. Material is somewhat hard but if you put time and effort into it you will get it, she really tries her hardest for you to get it too. Office hours are very helpful. | Never ever gonna take a class with this professor again. Terrible. Do not recommend. Khan academy taught me everything I know. Extremely condescending when asked important questions. Honestly, really disappointed with the lack of education especially with the thousands I'm spending. Great class though. | Frequent homework, but all weren't graded--more so practice to go over tricky ones in class. She tries to make sure every student understands the chapters and gave extra points towards homework. Pop quizzes are made clear when they'll be and which topics will be covered. Got an F and D on the 2 exams and still passed with the final and other grades"
"Forgoston, Sacha","One of the best math teachers who cares if you succeed, explains everything well in class and office hours are beneficial. Lectures are well organized and feel as if they go by quickly. She randomly calls on people throughout lecture to assure they are paying attention and understand the material. | If I had the chance to take her for all my math courses I would. She lectures with her ipad and projects it onto the screen. She's caring. Just keep in mind that she would go through her list of students and randomly call on someone to answer a question to track attendance. She makes the material seem easier than it actually is. | Very sweet professor & genuinely cares about her students. I took her for two semesters and enjoyed her teaching style. Go to office hours, she wants to help you!!! She will take the time to make sure you leave knowing the material and feel prepared for the weekly quizzes. Lots of work, very hard - but that is the math department in general haha | A lot of homework and weekly quizzes. Classwork doesn't always line up with homework/quiz material. Super charismatic teacher and she goes through every step thoroughly. Calls on random students in class and knows everyone by name, so try to attend all lectures. Gives feedback on all quizzes and exams. | Super caring and welcoming in class. Will randomly call on students by name, so make sure to be present since you only can be absent 4times excused. Weekly quizzes are mandatory and are not referenced much in lecture. Gives partial credit for work shown on exams/quizzes. | Doesn't care abt students, will leave you in the dust. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER, IDK WHY SHE'S GASSED UP SO MUCH ON HERE. | She's a very caring professor who is very patient with her students and truly cares if they succeed. Only downside is that quizzes are given every week and there are no make ups for them so attendance really matters. | A very great and caring professor. I took her for Math 106 and Math of Money! Although I'm not really good at math, she made it very easy to follow through her lectures and truly wants her students to succeed! | I took math of money spring 2021, Forgoston is a really caring professor and wants to help you, the class is not an easy A especially if youre not a math person, I took it to fill a requirement and to avoid calc, prepare to do a lot of homework, it does pay off but its a lot of work! Take good notes, for me everything was open notes | Prof. F goes above and beyond to help her students be successful. She has set office hours 2 days a week, but would answer any time. It is hard to teach online math, but she does a really good job explaining in detail even in her emails. There is a lot of work to maintain in this class though, 2 weekly hw, weekly quizzes and reading book quizzes. | I took Mathematics of Money online. As much as you'd think this course would be an easy A, it's not. Professor Forgoston assigns homework due every class and quizzes at least once a week. HW is graded on correctness, not completion. The midterms/final are worth a big portion of your grade. She is a very sweet person who will do anything to help you | Sweetest woman ever. I had her for Mathematics of Money during fall 2020 covid semester and she was wonderful. Material wasn't too hard. HW due every class. Quiz every week (only 3 questions). Drops lowest quiz and hw grade. Very understanding. I showed up to a quiz with 10 min left and she let me turn it in late with no penalty. Attendance matters | Very nice woman with a true passion for material. Mandatory attendance though as I found out the hard way. Homework every night and a quiz every other class. Certainly a lot of work but she is very sweet. HARD | Very nice woman with a true passion for material. Mandatory attendance though as I found out the hard way. Homework every night and a quiz every other class. Certainly a lot of work but she is very sweet. | She is really really sweet and caring for each of her students and just wants you to succeed. She takes lots of time in class to answer questions and make sure you understand the necessary material. She has a corny sense of humor, but she's so cute that you just get used to it. She's very sweet, and even gave us candy on Halloween!"
"Lieberman, Melissa","Prof Lieberman is strict but fair. Lots of homework, but she lets you redo it for full credit. Lectures are engaging. Used unstuck AI to prep - highly recommend! | She was really sweet and an RU alum herself. Very patient and respectful. A model teacher for sure. | An incredibly kind and supportive professor. She reviews early homework submissions and tells you what you got wrong so you can fix it for full credit. While pop quizzes are frequent, they're manageable, and she provides extra credit opportunities as long as you regularly attend lectures. Highly recommend. | Such a sweet and caring professor! So thankful I have her teaching me. | This class had lots of homework, I went to office hours EVERY week and still ended up with a C. She is a nice person but her grading is way too hard. This class was filling a sas math requirement and felt as if I was taking a graduate class. I would not take her again. I put so much effort into this class and it felt like all for nothing. | One of my favorite professors ever! Had her for math 103, 107, and 109. She is super sweet and generally cares about every one of her students. You get homework every class but it is only a couple of problems and you can submit more than once until you get a 10/10. As long as you come to class you will do well | I had Prof Lieberman for 103 and 106. I suck at math and got terrible grades during 103, but I still ended with a B. However, 106 I actually utilized her as a professor, she was so helpful and encouraging which was so helpful for someone mathematically challenged like me. Seriously if you suck at math take her class, she wants to help you! | Prof Lieberman is really strict with the way she wants her answers to be submitted, and is VERY picky. She does let you correct your answers and resubmit which is nice. A lot of homework, 1 midterm, 1 group project, and 1 final but VERY doable - not bad at all, just be ready to prioritize this class over other because it is time consuming. Take her | Exemplary Professor. Passionate and professional. Very down to earth and approachable. Positive attitude fosters healthy learning environment. Genuine investment in students' success. Goes above and beyond to assist. I learned just as much about effective pedagogy as I did about the various mathematical topics. Professor is a great choice for you! | Nicest Prof at RU. Genuinely a kind soul, her Math107 class is tedious but 100% worth it. Homework every week and you have an unlimited amount of tries to redo it. One midterm and then the final, make sure to study and listen to her feedback. Interesting lectures too! | Dr. Lieberman is a great professor! She was always willing to help and even stayed after class for an entire 40 minutes just for me! She really cares for her students. We would watch video lectures at home, work on problems during class, and take a really short quiz to test our understanding. Overall, great professor and not a bad course. | She genuinely cares about her students and can actually teach. She wants you to do well. All her lectures are recorded and posted afterwards so you can always rewatch those. I never studied and just watched the videos and took notes and I got A's on all the exams. Her exams are open notes. There are also so many extra credit opportunities. | Professor Lieberman is great Professor and the subject matter of the class is easy if you put in the work. She wants you to get an A, just put in minimal effort and study and this is a great way to get a QQ out of the way. | The material of this course is pretty challenging and Prof Lieberman does her best, but ultimately I would not take her again. Homework is twice a week with about 3-5 questions with multiple parts, graded on correctness. 3 exams and weekly quizzes at the end of class which is kind of annoying. Her notes are pretty good but exams are not easy. | SO AMAZING!!!! The most helpful professor ive had, she genuinely cares about your success, i wish i could have her for all of my classes!!! You will learn a lot from taking her class. | Professor Lieberman is a very caring professor and her lectures are great! You can tell that she really cares about her students and making sure that they understand the content. Her lectures are also very interactive and creatively designed! This was similar to her home-works, which were always fun to do! | Took it in fall during covid. 1 of the sweetest professors. The lectures are long but easy. Only the 1st topic is hard. Quizzes are super short and easy. Homework is manageable and the exams are not hard. I got a D on the 1st midterm and still ended up with a B+ If I did the extra credit I would have gotten an A cus it raises your grade by 2% | Prof. Lieberman is one of the best @ Rutgers. She genuinely cares about her students not only passing, but truly grasping the concept. She has a very thorough way of explaining material, and encourages you to ask as many questions needed. Has many office hours where she can truly drill things with you. Exams contain everything taught in class. | So far my favorite professor at Rutgers. She was funny in class and relates the math to the real world. Man, I hope I have her again. What I really like about the class is if you turn hw in early, she will tell you what you got right and wrong and you get another shot at the homework with the feedback. Also, the exams are almost identical to the hw | Professor Lieberman is my favorite professor! She is so sweet and caring + does everything she can to make sure students understand. She gives feedback on hw + allows resubmissions until you do perfect, and the work is manageable. She was great during COVID online instruction, and I wish I could take her again. She is everything a teacher should be | I loved Melissa. She was the best. Liberal Arts is perfect for those who are not the best at math. It's easy and she makes it even easier. She was so sweet and graded your homework over and over until you did perfect. Took her during COVID and she was so accommodating and helpful to all of us. I'll miss her class. Class is work, but easy to do. | Always available to help you if you need it. Challenging but wants you to succeed. Will give you a week to submit homework and grades it over + over again up until due date if you turn it in and correct your mistakes. Leaves lots of notes and suggestions about how to improve. Truly one of my favorites. Can't fail her class if you make an effort!!!! | She's very sweet and really wants you to understand and do well. But, she does give lots of homework, there's a group project, and she's very specific in the wording she needs. That being said she is great in office hours and makes herself as available as possible. | hands down the best calc professor ar Rutgers. She will teach you everything you need to know and prepare you well for the final, which makes up a good chunk of your grade. I would definitely take her again; there was no question I could not ask her to do because she is very knowledgeable in her field and very good at explaining to her students. | After failing calc and withdrawing from it, I was FINALLY able to pass with professor Lieberman. If you cant pass with her, you can't pass with any of the professors. She is so nice and teaches everything in such an organized manner. You absolutely must do the textbook homework problems to pass the exams which make up most of the grade. shes great! | Melissa shows a great passion for Math of Money. She explains everything in detail and makes sure everyone understands before moving on. She is always open to questions and does many different problems to expand knowledge horizon. | I hate math but Prof Lieberman made it bearable. She had office hours all of the time and if you could not make office hours, she easily arranged a time to meet up with you. The quizzes are super easy if you do your homework. There is a lot of hw. She drops 3 lowest hw and quiz grades. She is very nice. | Dr. Lieberman was one of my favorite teachers of all time. She is so caring and very organized. Her notes were clear and easy to follow which made somewhat challenging material much easier to understand. She goes above and beyond to make time for her students, especially around exam times. I would 100% take her class again. | She really knows what she is talking about and explains everything really well and it always enthusiastic to answer questions in office hours. She is very nice and approachable and understanding. I hated calc in high school but she made it enjoyable. | She is hands down the best professor I have ever had in my life. Most caring, sweet genuine lady you will ever meet in your life. I felt like she was my mom during the course. The material is extremely difficult, but if you work hard and do all your work you can get an A. I am not good at math and ended up getting a 95 on the final. Love you Prof! | Love her, such a nice teacher and very patient | She goes above and beyond for her students and wants them to do well. Her notes are very organized and clear. She is very easy to follow. I would definitely take her again! | HYBRID- She isn't the one teaching the material so she just gives examples and answers questions. There's 2 quizzes during class. Be sure you watch all of the videos & do all of the suggested review problems. Homework is given in class for a head start & any questions you have. The exams are long. It's an easy A if you do all of the work. | SO MANY QUIZZES. She gives out two quizzes per class and it is just overwhelming! She's such a nice lady but it can be really easy to fall behind in the class since it's only once a week and it's up to you to learn the rest since it's a hybrid. If you are good at teaching yourself then take this course. Her exams can be long and tricky sometimes. | Professor Lieberman's lectures make the material easy to understand. BUT the examples she provides in lecture are easier and simpler than the ones on homework and exams. Textbook problems and practice exam problems will help you pass along with going to office hours. | She is willing to help you if you ask her for help | The class was simply awful. I took it in high school, and it was more thorough there than at Rutgers. | Professor Lieberman is hands down the best calc professor in rutgers. She genuinely cares about the students and teaching. Attend office hours and you will pass. Put in time into the class and you will be guaranteed and A. | Great class, as it can be applied to everyday life. Attendance is pretty much mandatory bc each topic builds on top of the previous one. You also need a textbook for homework. The tests are pretty easy in the beginning but the topics become more complex later on. She's a great prof. helps in any way that she can. Also has tons of office hours. | I enjoyed this class very much and her teaching skills are great. She assigns HW every class (short problems) and quizzes once a week to help us understand topics better. She is such a sweet and caring lady. If you miss a class it will be difficult for you to pass b/c you'll miss out on a lot of good notes that helps you with the HW and quizzes. | Too much material covered. Sometimes goes too slow, sometimes too fast. Cannot manage the class effectively. Too many problems given at once, not enough theory. | I think she would be a good teacher at elementary/middle school level, but not for a Calculus class in college. Unfortunately, she doesn't prove major theoretical results in class and we simply are asked to memorize the steps that we need to do to solve certain types of problems. | She is by far one of my favorite professors at Rutgers. She is really good at engaging the class in the material & makes sure everyone understands before moving on. Whenever I had a question, she was always available after/before class, through emails, or office hours. Homework assignments were never too bad, and there were some in-class quizzes. | She is really good at teaching! She explains and writes every step,(this is helpful for those who forget some algebra and pre-calc stuff), has really neat handwriting, organized notes, and provides many examples. The web assign is harder than most of her examples but I think that is good because it make you reteach yourself the concepts! | She doesn't explain concepts thoroughly and rarely proves major results. She gives a lot of examples, but we need foundation before we jump into examples. | Teaches you to do math as a procedure. You learn to follow steps which isn't good, in my opinion. | She is very nice, I totally agree. However how isn't it her fault that almost all students did bad on the final? She should not teach for exams, she should not prepare for an exam. There should be no such thing as ""preparation for an exam"". She should teach critical thinking and give lots of tough practice problems during semester. | Dr Lieberman is awesome! Her notes start with briefly explaining concepts and then doing numerous examples. She does well explaining the ideas needed to be successful in the exams. It was not her fault that this semester the department made a difficult final but she spent the review days going over old finals to try to prepare us for the final. | Professor Liebermann is the nicest professor at Rutgers. She truly cares about her students and is there for them. She has so much passion towards what she's teaching which makes the class somewhat bearable. She is probably the easiest professor in the sense she prepares you well for the exam. But if you dont understand Calc, it wont help much. | Professor Lieberman was a brilliant professor! I wish our recitation professor was half as good as her. Overall she makes everything very simple and breaks things down so you understand completely. WebWork provides no help for students, just makes your grade worse. Her exams are pretty hard though, so study! Final was horribly difficult though. | I genuinely felt Melissa Lieberman was there for me through it all. Calculus requires tons of practice. Completing the ungraded homework is a must to pass. Unfortunately I didn't get the hang of things until it was too late. I am beyond grateful for her going out of her way with reviews this semester. But the departmental final was unprecedented. | Very nice and speaks English. But teaches you for a test. Gives many problems similar to what will be on the midterm written by her, or what is similar to previous finals. The final this year was written by a new coordinator and we were obviously not prepared for it. She should assign more conceptual problems and teach students to think in math way | It's a shame that we have to complete course evaluations before the final when everything seems to be alright. Then comes the final and you realize that you are not fully prepared for it. I gave her glorious reviews but was very disappointed after the final. Looks like we were not prepared for it. | Professor Lieberman is the best Calc 1 teacher Rutgers has to offer. She teaches like a high school teacher, meaning her classes and lectures are very structured. With that being said, this class is by no means a breeze. You are going to have to put in the work, but she is always eager to help with any of your troubles. | I studied the whole semester and did well on her midterms, but the department final was hard, and unfortunately I didn't do well on it at all. I think she should teach more concepts, not just how to do specific problems. Her midterm averages are also quite high which creates a wrong impression that you are doing well. | I LOVE Lieberman. Her class was unbelievably easy and her humor is entertaining enough to get you through the 80 minutes. Homework due every Monday, two question quiz every Thursday, and two exams plus a cumulative final. If you put in the most minimal effort you'll pass. I would definitely take this class again; definite GPA booster! | Gives homework every week (1 assignment usually 5 problems) but allows you to submit it, have it checked and then resubmit it with changes. Her lectures are repetative but she really makes sure everyone knows the material. Quizes and tests are straight forward and she gives a full class of review before hand. | Dr. Lieberman is by far the best professor I've had in college. I am horrible at math but because of her I've been able to do extremely well on everything. She is so clear when explaining material. She doesn't teach you unnecessary concepts you'll never use. She is so nice, always will to meet after class to help. Take her! she's AMAZING | Best math teacher so far. Notes are organized, detailed, and well illustrated. Going to office hours def improved my grade as she was more than willing to answer every question, clarify, and help with homework. Lots of quizzes, but they are easy & taken from the homework and class examples. She was funny, clear, and truly willing to help. | amazing teacher who is very clear with what she expects. the night before her midterms and the final she has review sessions followed by online sessions late at night to help with any last minute questions! will def take anything else she teaches. attendance isn't mandatory for all classes but she gives random attendance quizzes | She goes out of her way to help students who really care about getting the help. I would not have taken calc with any other professor besides her. Simply amazing professor. Really hard exams during the semester that make the final feel like a breeze. Because of that I got an A in the class. TAKE CALC WITH THIS PROFESSOR! | One of the best professors I've had. Really not a math person at all but she is very clear when teaching and doesn't put surprises on her exams. Go to class, do the online homework, and show up to recitation and you will do well. She goes out of her way to help her students. | Teaches you 'for a test'. All practice problems are the same as the ones on the test. I took Calc I in high school and wasn't challenged in her class at all. If you are a mediocre student or need an easy A take her. | Lieberman is the best teacher for calc. Her exams mimic the final so you WILL be ready for the exam. I was nervous I wasn't going to get an A but she really did help. | I absolutely love Dr. Lieberman. Going to office hours is rewarding, she really helps you understand the homework or any class material you are confused about. Great review sheets, plenty of practice problems. Her exams are clear and go to her review sessions. She is very nice and makes you feel comfortable to ask anything. no recitation. | I love this professor. She is so good. | This woman is an incredible teacher and a really nice person. Im terrible at math but with her help and explanations for the problems I managed to get an A in Calc. If you can take it with her I highly recommend it. | Great professor. She is way better then Noone. | She's such a great calc professor, completely speaks English, makes everything very easy to understand. If you go to her for office hours she's SO helpful. Definitely take her for calc 135! | PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE ANY CLASS SHE TEACHES! AND LAUGH AT HER CORNY JOKES!"
"Beals, Robert","If you're looking for an easy course to fill a requirement DON'T take this class. It's very in depth for a 100 lvl course with a lot of memorization. That said, if you do take the course you will learn A LOT about an interesting topic from a brilliant man! Very approachable and helpful. I actually looked forward to his lectures.... | It's a true honor to be taught by this man. He's absolutely brilliant, very important in the field, and still has time to coach us lowly undergrads :) The material is hard, sure, but didn't you come to college to learn? Definitely not your average 100-level, but I personally was glad of it. Blumenschine is the man! | If you're good w. memorizing then you wont have a problem at all. Info in lectur was interesting but couldnt get over his inability to speek :""Last uh week we uh talked about uh the difference between uh australopithicus...."" Knows his stuff though. Reminds me of dr grant from jurassic park. Crammed last minute and got a B | DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS JUST TO FILL A REQUIREMENT!!! much harder than a typical 100 level course-tons of memorizing !! labs useless but TAs helpful and have pretty much everything to do with grade..should really only take this if you're already interested in anthropology! | Dont be deceived by the 102 level. This class is HARD. So much information to memorize since there are only 2 exams. The exam questions have like 6-7 options. A,B,C,None of the above, All of the Above, A+C, A+B, B+C. Do not take this class if youre looking for an easy 4 credit class | Seriously, GO TO CLASS! He doesn't take attendance for his lectures but I promise you, they'll be material on the exam you won't find in the book. His lectures are clear but I found myself having a hard time taking notes fast enough so I bought a tape recorder. Oh, he's dreamy. | Blumenschine is a great lecturer who has personally experienced a number of the archaeological sites in the text. He's even referenced in the book. He's enthusiastic (and admittedly, handsome). However, he has nothing to do with your grade. Talk to your TA and read the book, make index cards and you'll do fine. | Had him for intro to evo Anthro. Awesome professor. Why? I hardly went to class, BUT went took the weekly quizzes with the TA. Though some people complain about not doing well in the class I think it would be hard to do poorly as there is a HUGE curve on the midterm because people usually don't do well on it. I went from a B to a high A. Good guy. | I took this class bc I actually had intrest in what I thoughtthis subject was prior to taking it. plus all the comments made me thing this would b an easy class. WRONG. Going to lecture is not mandatory and very boring, but it prob helps.alot of info. must attned recitation, quizzes every week. tests are HARD- but have good curve, got an F on =C | Quite the jokester, Blumenschine is known to mix deer bones in with the fossils and bones of ancient humans as a practical joke. Watch out for that. TA's are very helpful and try as hard as they can to help. Don't take this class alone. Go with a friend. Blumenschine could very well be Father Time. Besides being hard, he is the perfect specimen. | Firs and foremost, Blumenschine cycles between three outfits. He has the white shirt, green plaid, and blue. Always buttoned except for the top, no shirt underneath (when he wears the white one you can see his skin tone through the shirt.) As a man, Blumenschine ranks amongst the top. He LITERALLY created an ancient tool out of volcanic rock. LOVE. | bloomy, as he's more affectionately called, is a total dreamboat. though class is a complete bore, his decadent, soothing voice takes away a good deal of the pain. Class isn't too hard, not easy though. i put in 0% effort and got a B. | Blumenschine is an awesome professor. He really knows what hes talking about and lectures are not that bad, he tries to make them interesting.the material is really cool i highly recommend taking the class with blumenschine | Go to class, learn, and love. He is so intelligent. Blumenschine has been teaching this class for years & it shows, which may or may not be a good thing. Bottom line- take notes, but LISTEN to understand concepts beyond the powerpoint.. and you'll do well. I really enjoyed him, even if the material was dry at times. | The first half of the class is pretty much reviewing 8th grade bio, so its easy going, but he makes the second half of the course really interesting and I found myself wanting to go to class. The course work isn't hard at all, and you actually learn something. Take this class | he's great. he's so interested in what he's doing, he makes it fun for you. The TAs are really helpful. If you just pay attention in class you'll get a great grade. I loved this class. | Lectures were boring, quizzes were hard, but I still managed a B. Take good notes and you'll do fine. | I really could see Blume like riding through the Sahara in a land rover getting shot at as he excavates early hominid fossils in Indiana Jones fashion like people mentioned before haha. Any way he's a great professor and he makes the information easy to digest. But des the test really have to be that hard? Drew Gerky was a good T.A | The second half of the semester was far more interesting and focused a lot more on human evolution. The exams are ridiculously difficult and TAs/recitations are not helpful at all. | He is so organized! Not gonna lie, the 1st exam was a lot harder than I anticipated but I ended up getting an A. And don't worry, there is a HUGE curve. If you go to lecture (and try to do the readings before lecture, it really helps) you'll be fine. recitation helps.. you should go!! | Don't take this class if you are not an anthro major! The textbook is 10x more interesting then lecture. the class is very science/bio oriented. Class is taught at a 300 level. I have a 3.7 gpa and studied really hard for the exam, but I was surprised at how hard it was. The questions are confusing and the TAs are awful. | his tests are not difficult, but rather the questions are very vague and unclear. to quote my neighbor on the test, ""he wrote it like an ass"" | Just take notes and study them and you will easily get an A. Good presentation. | loved the class. felt once he got passed the genetics in the beginning of the semester, he really gets into the human evo topic | he is a little too cocky for my taste, needs to not design his classes as recaps of the readings, and needs to organize his lectures a little better to | UUUGHHH!!! I didn't hate him, but I hated his class. BORING lectures, make you lose concentration, and exams are REALLY hard. | excellent class - excellent lecture - he is one of the best professors i've ever had - he interacts with students - he doesn't just talk AT them - he is extremely intelligent and will challenge you - he is also extremely fair (p.s. - indiana jones aint got nothing on blumenschine :) | very interesting class. i learned a lot on a wide array of topics. he tries his hardest to make some of the dull information come to life through fun analogies, demonstrations, and hundreds of pictures and diagrams. sometimes a little difficult to understand but an overall great and caring guy.. | Doesn't really have a speech problem, just says ""um"" a lot like someone said. Pretty good lecturer, seems like a nice guy. Tests are hard as hell but theres a BIG curve as mentioned. I agree with someone else that Stephen Merritt sucks. | Very helpful professor, slight speech impediment. Huge curve on the Exam, but you DO LEARN a lot of information in the class on a wide array of subjects pertaining to evolutionary thought. Good guy, GO TO RECITATION, they help a lot and grading becomes easier on you!! | besides the little speech problem i think he's really good, though recitation does help alot. | Blumenschine is YUMMY as ever. Hes like the indiana jones of the anthropology department. He says 'UM' alot but thats is only because he puffs on some magic dragon bones. His test is hard cuz hes used to teach graduate students, but huge curve nonetheless. | He's a REALLY nice and helpful professor, although he has a little speech problem. The exams were pretty hard, but there's a huge curve. His head TA, Stephen Merrit, will put you to sleep, but he was still mildly helpful to me.. could definitely be worse. | Quantification of Archeology Data is very boring, and obnoxious, but Blumenschine HELPS a lot, and he doesn't penalize for late reports. The only grade is a HUGE report at the end of the class, which takes a lot of time and effort, but he grades easily, and will point out mistakes for you to fix. | He is a nice guy that knows what he is talking ab out, tests are hard, but he has a huge curve on them 54/100 = C. The TA, Stephen Merritt, should not be taken for recititaion. He is not as helpful as the professor, and seems to like it when you get HW wrong; grades harder, like hes the professor. | Nice guy who is very clear in his lectures once he gets started. He has a minor habit of too many pauses, but he does make the class interesting and is very helpful."
"Kinkhabwala, Rita","This professor can be tough, but staying engaged and using resources like unstuckstudy for study prep helps. Attend office hours and be ready to participate - it's not easy, but doable with effort. | I tried everything possible I went to office hours for help, I even got a tutor. The tutor taught me better than her. The quizzes look like nothing you learn in the class. She just always had an attitude when asked a question. I wouldn't take her again avoid at all cost. | Do not take this professor unless you want your GPA to tank or to feel bad about yourself. Gave quizzes that many students did poorly on despite studying. She didn't encourage participation because she would yell at us for not knowing the answers. She made students cry, and often went on long tangents about herself and money. | Do not take this professor. If a student didn't know a question, she would say it was ""logical"". She would belittle her students, and use blatant words. However, during office hours, she was a sweetheart and sympathetic. | I participated a lot in her classes because the content was interesting but she is a tough grader that is not very clear on what she is expecting. | Professor Kinkhabwala only cares about one thing and its money, since that's all she talks about in every single lecture. She is super condescending when students ask her questions and acts as if you are stupid if you do not understand the content. If you have her please switch to another professor it will save you from trauma. | Professor Kinkhabwala would have been an amazing professor had this been a higher level math class. She has an deep understanding of math and always gives a challenge. Unfortunately, this was a remedial Algebra 2 class so as you could imagine I genuinely could not keep up. Teaches way too fast, rude, but she will always teach you the shortcuts. | The literal worst belittles everyone in her class. | Very difficult, if you do not take this course serious. Office hours are a must. | BEWARE! Despite what everyone is saying, this teacher is very so so. If you get on her good side, might go better for you. However she is very rude and gets upset at the students for asking questions. Office hours are a must if you want to pass this class, and if you understand math very well then maybe you can take this teacher. If not, stay away | This was the most disrespectful, arrogant, obnoxious, rudest professor I have ever had in my 4 years at Rutgers. Explains something once, and if you don't understand it after she's done, she becomes very irritable & frustrated, then proceeds to belittle you and everyone else in the classroom. Probably the worst math professor in the RU math dept. | She answers emails 2-3 days after you send them. Doesn't explain things and gets mad when you don't already know what she teaching. I tried going to office hours to help my grade, but she never understood my questions so I leave more confused then when I started. Was better off teaching myself than listening in class. Theres a test every class. | I was with Rita during the pandemic and she was very rude, always yelling at students, and didn't help. She would tell us to ask questions and when we did she would yell and say we should've learned that in high school. DO NOT take this professor unless you want to fail and be miserable. The only person who helped was my TA. BEWARE!!!! | She can be very caring but easily irritated when trying to teach. The classes are pretty interactive so you get to ask for help and ask any questions during lecture. The homework and quizzes are most consistent but tests are worth tremendously more so focus on that! great @ office hours too. | This professor does not acknowledge problems the students are facing during the pandemic. So imagine what she will be like when everything is back to normal... She says to ask her questions about the material if we dont understand. But when someone does not understand she gets mad at everyone. She is the most unhelpful professor I have ever had. | She yells at her students when someone has a question and asks us why we don't understand because it's all ""logical."" She does not explain the material properly, and when teaching a new lesson she expects us to just understand what she's doing. She always makes mistakes while doing work and when someone fixes her mistake, she blames it on the chat. | I had her at 8 am and she was very rude. She is very strict when it comes to cellphones. If you do not know the material then you are really out of luck, and she isn't truly helpful. Calls students out and makes very rude comments. (I saw this more with some athletes in class). Doesn't answer emails but will answer them in front of the class. | She is a real gem. She is very nice and caring, but serious and blunt so she may seem a bit arrogant. Her lectures are always interesting because she's HILARIOUS. The class may seem easy as well as the exams BUT THEY ARE NOT! You must attend every class to pass and study alot to get a good grade on exams. She is very strict about phones in class. | Honestly, Professor Kinkhabwala is not as bad of a professor as everyone else says. She genuinely cares about her students and is willing to help. Although, she is a harsh grader and her exams are tough and you will really have to work at the class and study a lot in order to pass. Strict about cell phones as well and isn't afraid to call you out. | had her at 8am and she was so rude & nasty it was super uncalled for like shes very mean spirited, always screaming, even occasionally insulting her students. didnt understand the material? congrats youre getting an attitude from her! besides being completely disrespectful shes very inconsistent and tough with grading so watch out for that. | I was depressed waking up every day to go to be in university because of this professor. Such a tough, scary and intimidating professor. As a human being she is nice and okay in office hours but for some odd reason Im class she turns into such a hard teacher. By that I mean quiz almost every day, yelling and extremely mean. A student even cried. | Inconsistent with grading. | Rude, rude, rude! Dreaded going to this class! Steer far away from her! | GO TO OFFICE HOURS! She comes off scary at first and throughout the course she does have moments where she's really intimidating. She means well, but at times she has the worst attitude. Regardless, she tries her best to make the material seem easy. I didn't do the best, but that's on me. DO THE HOMEWORK! It's for your benefit, trust me. | GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! She may seem scary on the first day but if you put in the effort and take the time to go to her office hours she is super sweet an will make sure you succeed! No joke, one of the greatest professors I have ever had. She is a tough grader but if you put in the effort she is an amazing teacher and great at explaining concepts. | One of the best professors i have ever had. She does a great job making you understand the material and class is enjoyable! Would definitely take her again | Attended every single one of her office hours, did every single homework problem assigned and did very well in the course. She knows the material inside and out and does a great job In helping you understand it. Thoroughly enjoyed this class and now I have a very solid foundation to continue on to more advanced math courses. | She is one of the worst professors at this university. So extremely rude to students when she has no right to be. Not helpful. When anyone makes a mistake or asks a question she yells and makes them feel like such an idiot. I dreaded this class every week because of her. She has no problem calling you out in front of everyone. steer clear of her. | She is most definitely a great teacher, her lectures are efficient and precise. She is a very educated women who knows her material inside out. She does come across sometimes as if she yelling at you but in reality thats just how she responds to questions. Definitely hilarious moments in her class and would take it over because learned so much. | Professor Kinkhawbala (yes, learn how to spell her name because you will lose points on your exam if you dont) is exceptional. She is a harsh grader and is a harsh teacher but deep down she genuinely cares about your success and is only trying to help. Her constant yelling only motivated me to do better. She is truly a wonderful professor. | Class Is Very Difficult And U Are Expected To Study Do HW. She Doesnt Check HW, But Gives Random HW Quizes. She Is Very Helpful And Encourages You To Do Your Best. Plus, She Has A Lot Of Office Hours. | She's amazing. | My best summary of her and the class. Really mean at times. Hurtful sometimes. Yells alot. Hard exams. Difficult quizes. Does not check homework, but do it if you want to pass. Makes you feel so bad for getting a low quiz or exam score. Dont skip class. In all, take the class. Sounds crazy, but you'll be happy you did when you get to Precalc. | She's actually one of my favorite professors. I'm horrendous at math and her lectures taught you everything you need to know for the class to succeed, plus she teaches short cuts and how to pass without putting in a ton of effort. She seems like she's yelling but I think it's more a personality quirk than anything. Her quizzes are just like exams. | She was rude, very mean to students who asked questions, and yelled at you if you didn't understand something. I think she would be a better teacher if she wasn't so uptight. The one thing I did like about her was she explained everything SO well. I barely had any questions because I walked out of class understanding everything. Great at teaching. | Dr. K.... what an interesting woman. She is only sarcastic when people ask dumb questions, like forcing her to repeat herself. But she's a great teacher. Although her quizzes are hard, they are EXACTLY identical to the final exam. Anyone who got a poor grade simply didn't show up to class. Kindness goes a long way with her. | Worst professor ever! that's all you need to know | Professor K is a great teacher. She genuinely wants all of her students to do well in math and in life, but she is very strict and tends to yell. Because the material is difficult this approach might work out for the best. Go to her office hours if you can and she will like you. She is always willing to explain a problem | Comes off as pretty mean and tends to yell when you ask her to repeat the question. However, once she warms up she has no problem explaining the problem and answer. Makes interesting points about life. Kind of interesting for a math class. If you need personal help, she will help you, but i would try to find a different teacher. DO HOMEWORK! | I can't help but laugh when I think back to when I had Ms. K. Yes she is a bit aggressive when it comes to her teaching, but she is VERY THOROUGH when it comes to explaining. She genuinely does care about her students and wants you to understand. She YELLS a lot when she is not being understood but it puts everyone in check. But still very helpful | She is a little scary at first, but is an AMAZING teacher. so clear, and youll realize once you have a sub because every other teacher SUCKS. get 100s on quizzes and hw's, because it helps. i got a 60 on the first exam, 88 on the second, and 93 on the final, ended up with a B. Theres no curve but I think they make the final super easy because of it | SHE'S IS AWESOME! She's a no **** type of lady. She is not afraid to say whats on her mind and not afraid to put you in check. She generally cares about her students and doesn't care if she has to offend them to get them to listen! Loved her, I just emailed her today saying thank you. Wouldn't have made it through 115 without having her in 026. | Mrs.K I a great math teacher, if you want a math teacher who talks about math the whole period then do not take her, however if you want a math teacher, who teaches math but also discusses its relevance in the real world take her class. You will not fall asleep..and don be surprise of her yelling she does that alot, however GREAT teacher. | WORST PROFESSOR EVER! If you get her do yourself a huge favor and switch to another professor. She goes to fast and does not care if you understand the material. I went in and came out learning the same thing and i was in class everyday and did the homework. | She's not such a bad prof....you just have to pay attention...and put up with her condescending way of teaching...but I still managed to get a few chuckles out of that class...Do your homework!! It totally makes a difference! | Ms K! I have a love hate relationship with her. She's very intelligent and knows her stuff and if you take down all the notes she writes and pay attention and ask questions you will be set. She will make you feel dumb and there is favoritism with those who are good at math. But if you have a sense of humor you may get on her good side! | I LOVE MRS K. I was hesitant at first because it just seems like shes screaming at you all the time but if you joke around with her and try she's not so bad. Listen to her and read the book. Come on people, it's math. All math teachers are relatively boring. At least you can stay awake in this class and prepare for the final well. | the hardest teacher i have ever had, and shes mean. attendance is mandatory, and she does offer a lot of extra help, but she didnt explain anything well at all. do not take her, unless you want to be miserable. | She's an average teacher but she really does care about her students and puts a lot of extra time in to make sure they do well. But you have to put the effort in to get the extra help! She is condescending at times but that's only when people don't pay attention and ask the same questions OVER and OVER. Her moral lessons are the best! | Best professor! she had hard exams, but if you do the homework the exams are really easy. she prepares us so well for the final, that the final seemed so easy! I definitely recommend professor kinkhabwala! she is so helpful! | Contrary to what everyone else whining bout, if you don't have her, ADD HER! She yells at students, but in a caring way, to emphasize key points, unlike other profs. who hate teaching. Once a week, she has a 3 HOUR REVIEW SESSION, (aside from office hours). The problem with these raters is that they probably didn't take advantage of these. TAKE HER | She is SO hard. I got either 90 or 100 on every hw and quiz because the ta grades them I only got a 75 on my first exam and a 44 on the second!!! The class average was a 52!!! DROP HER NOW | shes rude, obnoxious,and makes you feel stupid for asking questions. she doesnt explain stuff well at all, and gets mad if you ask her to go over it again. i would really reccomend taking someone else. trust me, i usually get A's in math. | worst teacher ever. Even if you are amazing in math she will discourage you from wanting to learn anything new. Her exams are not that hard but they are impossible to pass because of the way she grades them. lets say perhaps if you put a bracket on the answer when its suppose to be a parentheses thats 4 points out of 5 off!! Drop her class Asap ASA | Drop the class for the love of God. | The course material for the class is absolutely easy but she is by far one of the worst math teachers I have ever encountered. The way she speaks and explains the material is extremely confusing. Drop her as your teacher if possible. | OMG, by far the hardest teacher ive ever had. She is incredibly smart but you cant understand what she says and she flat out hates everyone. If your wrong she'll spend 5 minutes verbally abusing you. She makes even the smartest people feel stupid. Exams are ok because they're made by department. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS!!!! | While I was in her class I thought she was the meanest most condescending teacher I have ever had. That pretty much remains the same. However, she really knows her stuff and the math professor I have now doesn't even know how to add in her head. Ms. K was able to do almost all the math in her head. Plus she really prepares you for the final. | this lady is freaking ridiculous I ACED algebra & went to precalc w/ her & she is the WORST PROF ive EVER had Im really open minded & even stayed in the class until the last possible day to withdraw & she is just an idiot She gives you moral lectures & tells you about how she wont baby 'johnny' this made up kid DO NOT TAKE, EVEN IF YOUR GOOD AT MAT | Do not take her class! She is the meanest teacher i have ever encountered. She makes you feel like crap. I hope she dies tommorow. I know that sounds mean but she makes you not want to go to class the next day. I had her over the summer for intermediate algebra, and it was every day. (imagine the hell i went through). I hated goint to her class. | She really wants you to do well in the class..BUT she makes you suffer.. You need to study, bc she expects you to know everything from algebra n other classes before the one you took. Also, she only explains once, and you better get it, or else you will be humiliated..If you go to office hours, and pay attention..You will do great in her class. | No Comments | I dont care what anyone says... This teacher is awesome. Math is going to be hard no matter what teacher you have, but with RK, she really prepares you for the final by giving hard exams throughout the semester and helping you conceptualize formulas rather than just memorizing. When i took the final it basically felt like elementary math. goodluck | I had this woman for Precalc and she is one of the worst professors at Rutgers. The class was harder than I expected, and I went to her office hours to go over the first exam, and she accused me of cheating and changing my answers. I proved her wrong since she had a copy of the exam, but she still didn't give me credit for the problem! | have had her twice, extremely mean lady who needs to get laid...IF SHE CAN. Math is probably the only thing in her life she as a grasp of. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER, YOU ARE WARNED. | She's the meanest professor I've ever had! If I asked a question she would ask me why I don't know it. Will humiliate you if you look tired during her 8:40am class. Scariest woman, I still have nightmares. | honestly, reallly hard class but i was EXTREMELY prepared for the final and now am doing really well in calc which i definitely contribute to her.. overall shes not very understanding and a kinda mean but the womans a really good teacher.. | She comes off as a really mean teacher, but she's just trying to prepare you for the final. Her tests are kinda hard so go to her extra help sessions. All you need to do is go to a couple of them and she'll remember you and help you out anytime. The final was a breeze because she prepared us really well and I got a B+ in the class. | She is a very nice lady, hard to understand at times. Her exams can be challenging but all in all if you put in the time you'll do well. I did well in precalc in high school but struggled in this class still pulled out a C+ though. She really just wants to see her students do well so don't take her comments personally. | This may be one of the most undermining teachers at RU. Sure she is a nice person but her teaching skills are horrible. The first day you cannot even understand her. Her exams are hard as anything. The only upside is that the final is not as hard because she does not make it. she talks down to all students. If you get her drop b/f its too late"
"Sprague, Gabriela","Took this class with Professor Sprague for the summer session. The material was fairly easy, as long as you show up to class and pay attention, but attendance was not mandatory. She does sometimes explain things in a more complicated way than necessary, but you could just do it your own way if it works. Take her if you can. | she explains things in the weirdest and hardest possible ways for you to understand. i've been learning math basically the same way through all my high school and college teachers but she simply just cannot do what everyone else does. i go to my other math teacher on thursdays and he teaches it a completely different way than she does it is crazy | her accent is super hard to understand. she does not explain anything well. it is so boring. it is horrible having to sit through this class- and it's only an hour and 20 mins. what she says makes absolutely no sense half of the time and she will start doing random equations in the middle of others and there is simply no way to not be confused. | This professor might possibly be the worst i've ever had. She simply just does not explain anything- she basically writes out numbers and reads them aloud and expects you to understand. she is very rude when you ask her questions and almosts acts as if it is weird that you don't understand with her horrible explanations. DO NOT TAKE | Teaches the absolute bare minimum, moves too fast, the whole shebang. Do NOT sign up for any classes with Professor Sprague. | I'm really bad at math but she taught very clearly and answered all questions well. I'd definitely recommend her to anyone who needs a little extra help in math! | Has a thick accent and moves very quick in all her lectures. Tried going to office hours but answered passive aggressively and barely helped because she would focus her attention on a select few students from other classes. | She has a really thick accent which makes it hard to understand what she's actually talking about. She expects everyone to already know the content so what she teaches is the bare minimum on the subject, and then the homework is 6+ hours of work each week (most of the time its trying to make the connections of the work in class to the homework) | Professor Sprague is awful, and you should look at her other ratings at Brookdale. | takes her time explaining classwork and is always willing to answer questions. I would definitely take it again"
"Schwarz, Jeffrey","I know I didn't take an extremely tough math class, but professor Schwarz has been really fun. He is funny during his lectures and clearly works out every problem. If you want to be successful in his class, you will need to work outside of class (1 hour of class, 3 hours studying). He is also super accessible for office ours. | He was my calc recitation prof, and honestly taught better than my actual calc lecturer. He starts off with easier problems and gives time to work on them. He explains everything well and posts it online afterwards. While he does provide a good foundation for learning, his problems are not nearly as difficult as the exam questions you'll get."
"Woo, Jeffrey","One of my favorite professors! Wilhelms genuinely cares for his students and it shows! If you wanna learn about sociology and get something out of this course, TAKE HIS CLASS. If you want an A without doing any work, AVOID!!! I've taken 2 of his classes and gotten an A in both. Just pay attention during class and take good notes. | Would NOT recommended if you have other options. Tests require handwritten, half-page answers with citations of Constitutional articles and court cases. Grading is subjective. 24 potential questions to study, only six appearing on the test, and five to be answered. | Professor Wilhelms truly cares about his students and gives you an idea of what he is going to put on his exams. Attendance is important! He shows interest in the topics and does talk about personal experiences in class, but this honestly helped me to grasp the information better. Makes the class interesting. Best instructor I've had in 3 years. | 1. Talked a lot about himself and his personal views 2. No clear cut rubric or expectation for papers or quizzes (more like a guessing game of what he is looking for) 3. Grading is subjective 4. Poorly designed class/ one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Rutgers | I did not enjoy this course whatsoever. It felt like in every lecture he talked about himself more than the material. NO idea what his grading criteria is-Got points off for seemingly no reason on quizzes and midterm paper. I worked hard in this class, and it feels like I have nothing to show for it because of the way he grades. DO NOT TAKE | Super unclear with expectations. Does not have any rubric and expects students to guess what's on his mind. You can be an honors student and still fail this course cause you didn't meet his criteria. Rutgers should really look into this because this is not an education, it is a guessing game that messes with real students. | Terrible. Gives no instructions & has no rubric then grades papers like it's spelt out. Returns grades with no feedback & upon asking for some he say's he's busy grading papers go look at the syllabus (which say's nothing). 8 pg midterm, 8 pg final (include every word from lecture to get a decent grade)10 pg research paper given with no instruction | You are graded by only three things: two midterms (that you only have 3 days to write 8 pages for) and a 10 page essay. No rubrics exist and the professor grades insanely harshly, so do not feel discouraged when you get a grade you feel you do not deserve. It is not you, it is only the professor who is making things unnecessarily difficult. | This professor is honestly the absolute worst professor I've had while at Rutgers. Has absolutely no criteria for how he grades you, doesn't even put assignments due on dashboard. Assignments are given out essentially through a small paragraph in his syllabus and he does not expand. Tough grader, gave no feedback. Lectures are dry and opinionated. | Professor Wilhelms is truly an outstanding professor with great passion for Sociology. His lectures can sometimes seem like ""tangents"" but are enjoyable nonetheless. This class IS graded by a few things (3 exams and one 12 page paper). The exams are a breeze as he gives review questions and he grades the paper leniently in my opinion. | He is an extremely tough grader and won't tell you what you did wrong or what you can improve upon. Other students in my class had the same problem with him, so it's very telling if all your students aren't doing well. If you are able to take another professor, take them! | Dr. Wilhelms is an older guy and his teaching style definitely reflects that, as he teaches primarily through lectures and the textbook. However, as long as you take good notes from both, over 90% of the material on tests is directly from those sources. Can be boring at times, but doesnt require much work outside of class. | He sucks, plain and simple. When I had him, I had A's for my other 4 classes(300-level courses), but a B+ for him. It was infuriating that the final score is based on only 2 exams. Find literally any other professor for 101. Lectures are extremely boring. He digresses so much you fall asleep. Exams are a mix of lectures & textbook. | Avoid. This is my hardest class this semester. The content itself is easy but if you don't write down exactly what he wants to hear on the exams he will deduct points. Grade is based on an exam + final (one exam is dropped) and attendance is mandatory. This is not an easy A. He's understanding and nice, but I wouldn't take him again. | 2 exams and a final exam. the worst non-final exam grade gets dropped. He gives problems for you to practice before the exam; some are actually on the exam. that being said, class is not an easy A. While it sounds easy, youll prolly find yourself working harder than you thought you would have to if you take this class. Dont take it if you dont need | If you are hoping to pass with an A, expect to suck up to the professor. He takes off for not using SPECIFIC opinions from his lectures. If you do not agree with him, he takes off points. He wants only the specifics that he teachers, nothing else, oh on the research paper, he will take off points with no rubric or instruction. | Tests are 2, 2-3 page papers assigned the day they are due. From 8am-11pm. He will take points if you don't have specific examples included in the paper. There is a 12-page research paper that is given in the middle of the semester. His lectures imo are interesting and there is like a recitation session where he talks to a section for particpation. | Tests are 8+ page papers and he gives 15 hours to write them. He will take off points for very specific examples that he wants you to mention but has never brought up in lectures. Incredibly tough grader, it's like he doesn't want to give people A's and will take off points for no reason. 12 page research paper. No final exam. Don't take this prof. | Taken during the pandemic. Tests are two-three page papers assigned the day that they're due (8AM-11PM). Figured out by the final test that he really just wants you to rehash his lectures in a 3 page paper each topic, centered around a specific question. Harsh grader, looking for specific points and not general themes of the class. | Professor is amazing!! Grades rely on attendance and the exams plus one writing assignment. He has an option to earn extra credit which should help if you lose small points. He's so passionate about people and if these topics interest you, you'll like the class. | Professor Wilhelms knows what he's talking about, but his tests have very little to do with his lectures. His lectures are really interesting, although he tends to talk a lot and often leaves little room for discussion. He offers a lot of opportunities for extra credit though! | Wilhelms's lectures are incredibly dry and I found myself zoning out more often than not. Exam questions, especially for the first exam, are worded way more confusingly than needed in an attempt to seem intellectual. The eight page paper is easy but time consuming and due at a bad time of the year for it so be prepared in advance | The only class I didn't fall asleep! Prof Wilhelms is a great lecturer! Topics are so interesting and he makes it more interesting by showing videos and bringing speakers. The course is about current issues and the work is not heavy. Attend the lectures, pay attention and take notes. You'll get an A. Will definitely take another class w/him! | No textbook required to be intentionally economically accessible; all readings provided by him and are thought-provoking and worth the time for those who usually skip readings. Professor Wilhelms is so caring; he genuinely cares for students' well-being. Just talk to him if you're having a difficult time in class, in life, etc. | Professor Wilhelms made such a difference to my educational experience and really invests his time in creating an educational growth experience for students. He is definitely a go-to dependable mentor and sounding board. He is so kind, and I think he grades too easily. | Wilhelms has great stories and background knowledge that he likes to use as anecdotal examples in class. I think people say that he gets too political in class because acknowledging all the baggage in American history that has shaped race relations is a difficult task, but it's also our reality. That's not just a ""liberal narrative"". It's history. | As a CJ major in my 4th year I have taken many CJ and sociology courses. I have done well in all of them. For a CJ elective, this professor will contradict whatever you have learned thus far. Lost interest in the class really fast. Is not clear on grading, doesn't seem to care about other peoples opinions, VERY opinionated. Look for another class. | Frustrating professor! Gave me an A- on both papers with no feedback and when I asked, he replied, ""no one writes a perfect paper."" There was not ONE SINGLE PEN MARK ON MY PAPER. Also teaches his opinions, not facts. I'm liberal and I thought what he was preaching was nonsense. Takes off points on exams for contradicting his personal opinion. | I'd highly advise choosing another professor. You will fall asleep, and he will not be happy if you do. Trust me, you along with the entire class will hear about it. | I took him for race relations. He is by far one of the worst professors that I have had while in the school and he does not have a clear criteria for grading his assignments and always goes off on tangents. You may fall asleep in this class but try not to because if he catches you, he gets upset, he is a very dry teacher. Do the readings to pass. | Preaches liberal views instead of teaching facts. Tough Grader? UNFAIR grader. He assigns a 12 page paper on your personal family history and prepare for a C or lower. Refuses to see sociological situations from others' point of view. | You think the class is do-able until you take the first test. I studied every single thing he had taught in class and still did not know what I was doing for the exam. He makes it impossible. Avoid him at all costs. | This guy sucks. It feels like you're in high school again: no phones or laptops allowed, takes attendance every class, in class assignments, etc. Very subjective about the material, even when grading, and is very sure to let you know his opinion. Very disparaging towards law enforcement. I could go on and on but this site only allows so many words. | Prof Wilhelms teaching style is very opinionated and there are facts but mostly what he speaks on is his opinion to the facts. You have to print everything out and be prepared to take the notes when you get there. His participation grades are unfair and you can lose points for nothing. Tougher grader for the essays, use facts, facts.. | (Race Relations) Don't know why the reviews are so bad. Prof. Wilhelms is long-winded and a little full of himself, but he definitely knows what he's talking about. He is very organized and presents all notes in a clear manner. All you have to do is go to class, pay attention, and then study your notes and you will get a B+ or an A. | Race Relations was a class that changed my life. Wilhelms is the most inspirational professor I have had at Rutgers. Yes, you do have to read and yes you do have to take (hand-written) notes. But college is about forcing yourself to learn and to expand your horizons. He is passionate and kind and deeply intelligent. | It seemed like he was trying to make it as difficult as possible to pass the class. Not allowed to bring computers but you are expected to be able to write down everything on the powerpoint AND everything that comes out of his mouth. Did not respond to e-mails and gave no participation points. Don't take him if you care about your GPA. | There were a few times where I was left confused over his opinion versus what we needed to memorize fact-wise for exams. He WAS opinionated but it's a class about race and issues surrounding this concept, so opinionated professors should be expected. It wasn't the easiest class, but I learned from it and he makes you work hard for your grade. | Worst professor i've ever had. He is an arrogant a**hole who pushes his opinion and viewpoint on you. His tests are wordy and confusing and he purposefully tries to trick you. I read every reading, made outlines before tests, and studied for hours and could not manage to get a B. He outright told me that he doesn't give A's. Work hard for nothing. | Absolutely wonderful, and incredibly passionate professor. Open up your ears, he has a lot of truth to share. | too hard for intro to soc. i took a 200 level soc before intro got an A+, took a 300 level during this and got an A in that and got a B in this. he is a good teacher, nice guy and everything but way too hard i shouldve breezed through this class with an A, but studied read did the hmm everything and got a B. wasnt worth it for 101. | Professor is a very nice guy! However, class can be somewhat boring. As long as you attend most lectures (I skipped a few) and outline the chapters before the exams, you will get an easy A! Also, he dropped the lowest exam grade (we only had 3), and some questions on the final were the exact same questions from previous exams. Take him!! | Coming from a guy who disagreed with about 90% of what this guy says, I actually really enjoyed this class. You can tell he is very passionate about the subject matter. Exams are pretty easy as long as you attend class and read the textbook (which is online unfortunately). Also very nice guy, I recommend him!! | Did not teach systematically so the material was a bit unorganized. Reading the textbook is important. Don't skip any classes, come in late, or touch your phone because he hates it a lot. He gave me a B+ but my grade calculated into an A. Emailed him a few times regarding that and he didn't answer, had to call department to get my grade fixed. | Take him if you really need to otherwise avoid. He goes off topic counts if your late or on your phone also takes attendance. He task include soo much writing. | mandatory attendance. gets off topic every lecture with irrelevant personal stories. he's nice when trying to give a few extra credit points here and there, but just reads off slides and goes off topic the entire class. and if youre on your phone, he will call you out in front of the class. would not recommend this class. | an amazing teacher! is so passionate about what he is teaching. attendance being mandatory can be a little annoying, but if you just listen to what he says, you should be fine on exams. Lecture notes and readings make up most exams, (didn't touch the book). have a 95 average in the class. TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM!! | Professor Wilhelms is an amazing teacher. I took his race relations class and I can honestly say I have never had a professor be as passionate about what they are teaching as he is. Take this class! | Class attendance was mandatory but pretty boring. He goes off on tangents a lot, and if you're conservative at all he's going to bug you. I'm pretty liberal and his rants even annoyed me. He emphasizes reading the book but i never touched it and got a B+ | If you are interested in social problems take the class if you want tests where you know all the questions then take the class. Teacher is boring but is really easy to figure out whatever he repeats 100 times will be on a test and the book isnt really important just have four points for each question answer. | DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.He is boring and lectures on about pointless things and it take him 5 minutes to finish a sentance. He an **** and makes his tests super hard and really tricky.I went to every class and read all the readings and still got a C+ I dont know how.I hate this man and going to his classe was the worst 1 1/2 of my weeks.DONT TAKE! | most boring professor ever!!!!! he is horrible. completley monotone voice and i cringe every time i have to go to his class. time drags by because all he talks about is his wife and brother in law who stutters. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. his tests are ridiculous and he doesnt even give them back when they are graded to see what you got wrong. | do not take this class if you are a conserative or republican. I am and I cringe for an entire hour and a half while he talks about his love of ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS! he said ""I would give everyone a green card"". his classes are boring and pointless as he talks about his ballroom dancing classes with his wife and sons soccer games.DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS | I was very interested in this class prior to taking it and the text was interesting as well, however the way he droned on made it incredibly boring and I could not even pay attention. Tests are simple, but have some tricks on them. Overall ok if you absolutely have to take this class, but wouldn't recommend it if you want to stay interested | Wilhelms is a great guy and very passionate about what he teaches. I don't know what people are talking about when they say his class is boring, he tells great stories and I find myself always talking about things I have learned in his class. Also, I think the books he choose are great, I actually enjoy reading for class. This class is an easy A :) | Actually scratch that last comment... he probably drives a Prius. | If you want an easy B this is a good class for it, but i warn you: there are other professors who are just as easy but MILDLY interesting. This guy is incredably boring, more than half his class is asleep. He also has a fetish for illegal immigrants and probably smuggles truck loads into the country in the back of his station wagon. Avoid him! | He is very passionate about his work. Its mandatory that you attend his class. The test come from the book and videos. There are also maps on the test, which are in the back of the text book. He dropped the lowest test grade and he also gave extra credit. As far as his teaching tech. i did not like them b/c he jumps from one subject to the next. | Prof. Wilhelm's lectures are very important to attend if you want to do well, but they can be boring. He sometimes has interesting stories to share though and has an intense passion for sociology. You must read the assigned chapters from the text if you want to do well on his exams. Many of the questions are right from the book. | The tests are short, and too much of it is based on random facts from the text. Make sure you know the relevant information as much as you know things like maps of the countries discussed and more obscurities in the text. He gives extra credit and dropped the lowest of two test grades. The lectures never seemed to be helpful, make sure you study. | Professor required the book be bought but he also made you bring it in for part of your grade, then he marked up the book when he had no right to! He asigns extra credit by where each student lives. Students closer to Toms River get more extra credit. It sound strange, but I'm not lying. Hes say's he'll do one thing, and then does the opposite. | Great professor! He gives great examples during class to help you understand concepts. His exams are fairly easy with a few difficult questions here and there. His class helped me decide on pursuing sociology as my minor (i'm a psych major). Take him if you WANT to learn because that's exactly what you'll do. | He is an interesting guy with lots of good stories. Tests are on info directly from the book. Sit in front and he will address you...in the back if you want to stay anonymous. | Well, he isn't the best sociology professor. He makes you read the book, however, doesn't address it in class. For his class you actually have to work HARD. Read the book take notes, go to lecture and take notes. Btw he has two books that you need to read out of, while other professor have one or NONE and their classes are 10x easier."
"Mulvey, Sally","Tough math class, but professor Mulvey is a great teacher. I highly recommend Professor Mulvey. She is a nice lady too, you will like her. | She needs to retire | The course is very fast paced. Her teaching style is pretty good, and I recommend her for students that have taken pre-calculus/calculus before in high school. I will say that her class can be tough for students that have not taken those classes before, so I highly suggest using time after class to review the material or visit office hours. | Lectures are composed of her going through problems in a very disorganized style. She either specifies too much of a certain concept or skips steps- leading to confusion either way. You end up leaving class with nothing learned and being forced to self study at home/recitation. Please save yourself the stress. | Professor Mulvey is the epitome of a mundane lecturer to the point where you can't recall the just of a topic at times. If you took Calc Honors in HS, it is not relatively close to the difficulty and rigorousness of Precalc 115. I recommend taking 111 if you know that are not quick to grasp onto lecture. Nevertheless, Prof M. always had a smile! | Great & caring professor, I had her as a freshman with no prior knowledge of precalc in high school. Cohesive communication & is willing to stop mid-lecture to answer any questions. Build your schedule around this course as it is very time-consuming. Get as much practice as you can with the material & you should be able to pass. Great professor. | Excellent professor who knows what she is doing. One of the best i am grateful i have her as my TA for this class notoriously known as difficult. | I took pre-calc 112 with her not 115, but I just wanted to leave a rating. Her exams were good, but grades depends on how much you practice textbook/webassign, but her teaching style worked for me. To me, she was great. The math department just sucks, basically dictated the whole class. | First day she told us how most of us would fail because they don't think its hard. At times, it felt like she wasn't supportive of her students doing well. One good thing is that she always made it to office hours, but her lectures weren't well structured. it wasn't a very cohesive class. not the worst, but look for someone else. | Sally Mulvey is not a good math professor. She breezes through the topics which leaves all of the students confused and even frustrated. She gives quizzes at the end of class and doesn't even give students time to stay a few minutes to finish. And makes lots of mistakes on her notes. I would not take her ever again. Take someone else. | Unnecessary negative reviews. She cares a lot for her students and gives a lot of partial credit. She's a very generous grader, and will answer any student's question. She has no issue explaining and gives many review sessions before the exams. I only wish I had gone to her office hours more before exams. You'll do good if you put in the effort. | The course moves fast but that is due to the time allotted. Prof. Mulvey is the best she is caring and funny. Do not blame her for not understanding the course at the end of the day the student is responsible for learning the material. | I'm currently taking this class as a freshman so I don't my final grade but I am currently failing. Loads of homework which is graded based on correctness, the tests are extremely difficult and she doesn't give partial credit. She moves so fast aswell so her lectures are lowkey useless. Most difficult class I've had to take for sure. | She forgets she's teaching a class a subject they haven't learned before... she moves way too fast students constantly had to ask her to slow down.She just seems so impatient with it. I also HATE the fact that H.W is only 5% of your grade yet she gives you like 100 a week. Such a waste of time working so hard for no change. wouldn't recommend her. | She explains concepts very well and it's easy to understand her lectures. It was always clear to understand what concepts were expected from us. Although her quizzes weren't on fixed intervals and were given at random, she would let you know beforehand and they were never too difficult. She responds to emails quickly & offers a lot of office hours. | She is a very tough grader. Moves very fast in lectures. Expect a lot of homework and the homework topics may or may not be covered in class. Homework is also graded | This was the worst class I have ever taken. I had a 3.8 and my GPA dropped to 2.9 due to this class. Seriously, dont take her. Shes rude when you ask questions and is a horrible grader. | Sally Mulvey is a sweet professor but VERY QUICK with the lessons. The homework almost never correlated with her lessons. Her tests are ridiculous, so freaking hard omg. She will NOT give you partial credit on a multiple part question. She is willing to help out and is nice but get ready to WORK in that class. Majority of my class failed."
"Morehead, Diane","professor morehead really cares about her students and her office hours are amazing for extra help. she explained everything step-by-step and even included extra practice problems when asked. there are quizzes every week during recitation which sometimes are difficult, but she goes over them during office hours if asked. | Dr. Morehead was honestly the best math professor I've had at Rutgers. She was so kind and truly cared about her students and would stay after class with no problem if I needed to make up a quiz. Precalc is tough I definitely had a much easier time than I would have with a different professor. 10/10 would recommend! | genuinely tries to help everyone understand the material, she will stop during lecture and answer questions. she is very patient and understanding and the homework is not bad | I had her for 111 and 112 she's one of the nicest and most understanding lectures in the department. Quizzes are just like the homework and her exams are very straightforward. Goes over difficult homework problems too at the end of every class. | a little over half-way through the semester with this prof. i gotta say she was a bit disorganized at first, but besides that, 10/10. she makes sure to explain problems and goes slower on harder problems. for someone who isn't that savvy at math like me, it helps a ton! | absolutely terrible teacher who just flys through problems without explaining how she got there and just assumes you know it. | Love her would take her again. Such a sweet lady who does more than enough in and outside of the classroom. | If there's another class open then take it because this professor is unorganized and difficult to understand her teaching. She's a sweet person if that's what you're looking for but should not be teaching. | Hated math already but she made it worse, very slow to speak and disorganised. She does know what she's teaching but isn't good at teaching. If you do pick her just make sure you are studying on your own aswell as she is not the best. | Class is alright; she goes slow for people who aren't amazing at math, but it feels extremely slow if you already know what's going on. Multiple exams instead of one midterm. She is a little awkward when teaching, but seems nice. Only 4 unexcused absences, so you have to show up to class. Different prof for recitation. | Not precalc 111 but 112. She is such a sweetheart, but she does tend to get lost in the lecture. She is unorganized but she knows what she's doing. But, wouldn't retake it with her. | had her for precalc 115, not 111. she's a bit all over the place, but she's a good professor. unfortunately, she doesn't give partial credit on exams, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she's a good prof nonetheless. | She's really nice and her class is easy but she is always all over the place and is a bit of an airhead. Shes not a tough grader most people just don't know how to do math. She doesn't know what to say a lot of the time but will dumb it down if you ask. | I enjoyed Professor Morehead's class despite the challenge it imposed on me. The class definitely requires lot of studying and work outside the class, however, she was very accessible and helpful in helping understand the material taught. She would also pinpoint types of questions that we would expect on the quiz, which was extremely helpful. | 3 Exams, 1 final and a quiz every week. (11)+hw. If you dont attend lectures, just do the homework and if you have any questions go to OFFICE HOURS because she will show you exactly what to do. Watch in 2x speed for quizzes because she is a bit slow because she wants you to understand. As for exams They are SUPER EASY if you review study guide. | I used to be good at math until this class lol. I started hating math. Dont take her for Pre Calc, she gives quizzes every week. So much homework every week too, you have to put in about 2-3 hrs everyday for her class. | Professor Morehead was available outside of class for help and explained concepts well! Quizzes in recitation were every week and a bit difficult, but theyre manageable. Her office hours are extremely helpful and she would stay later to help you if you need it. Great Professor and super nice! | Prof Morehead is a really nice person and is helpful. She was my professor for the recitation of this class, and she was much more helpful than my actual professor. The class is pretty tough if you're not the best at math, and you need to study A LOT. Quizzes every week and a decent amount of homework. Overall, tough but good class. | Professor Morehead provides clear and thorough explanations. If you struggle with math, I highly recommend her because she walks you through, step by step, if you ask her to do a problem. Shes very approachable and has really helped me out. | Professor Morehead's lectures are boring, and her exam reviews are the worst. She can't even do the math herself without looking at the answers first. You have multiple homework assignments due every week about 10-25 questions. Recitation is also terrible Professor Patel has no clue what he's teaching either. The quizzes are terrible (short answer)"
"Patel, Dhansukh","Had him for recitation in Pre-Calc, he is good at teaching and is very patient with students when they don't understand something. As long as you regularly attend the recitations, and ask or answer questions, you will find he is a very helpful teacher. | He's a very genuine guy and really tries his best but, he lacks the resources to write on a whiteboard. He needs students to correct him on the mistakes they catch (who knows how many others he makes). On top of it all, it is a little difficult to understand him when he speaks through the Zoom call. | I had professor Patel as a TA for precalc and he was amazing. Very kind and understanding, would do any problem you needed. Highly recommend him!"
"Amodio, James","if you need to take algebra- take him. take home quizzes and all homework assignments due last day of the semester. he walks you through examples rather than starting from scratch and covers a lot of material per class. not mandatory attendance- but need to be there for take home quizzes. | Overall you get about 10 take home quizzes, and some online problems throughout the semester, and two exams. In preparation for those exams he gives you a study guide that is completely different from the exam, and he gets a kick out of seeing all of his students struggle on the trick questions that were never taught. Overall a terrible professor. | This professor is amazing—funny, passionate, and clearly loves teaching. To succeed, just do the homework, study, and complete the review; his exams match it exactly. Those who failed and are hating on him on here, probably didn't try at all, and can't take a joke.He's caring, passionate, and a professor you wish others could emulate. | This professor ruined my life. He was extremely mean to me on multiple occasions. He has zero respect for his students. He often laughed at kids during class for getting questions wrong and made fun of them publicly to the class. I watched kids walk out of his class sobbing crying on multiple occassions. Students are submitting reports about this. | He was a very tough grader and basically failed the class no one knew what they were doing either | Doesn't actually teach anyone, the questions on the test are so much more difficult than the ones on the review, and makes fun of students for not understanding. I do not request this professor. | Rude to me after asking for an exam reschedule due to circumstance, He's a fine teacher, there are definitely better in the Rutgers Curriculum | The worst professor to take for intermediate algebra about 10 quizzes he lets you take home but they are basically worth nothing,2 exams which are nothing like the practice exams/study guide.He puts the easiest questions on the practice exams and gives you the hardest ones and tries to trick you on the real exam.Class average was 50% for both exams | Amodio is one of the better math professors at Rutgers but that doesn't change the fact that precalc is still hard. I would say he is great at teaching and keeps class interesting, but sometimes he wouldn't fully write out problems and do part in his head. He was always open for questions and would help before/after class and office hours. STUDY! | Prof Amodio was excellent. His lectures were very organized and easy to follow. After having a super confusing professor earlier in the year, when I switched into his class I was finally able to understand the material. He simplifies problems and gives good short cuts. Precalc at RU is hard but he makes it very manageable.Would take him again. | Precalc is hard, but if you have to take it, take it with Amodio. The lectures are really easy to follow. I think I learned more by taking one semester of precalc with Amodio than I did in the entirety of high school math. (quick PSA: STUDY FOR YOUR EXAMS. No matter how good your professor is, if you don't study/pay attention, you will struggle) | Go to office hours 100% | I don't think that Prof. Amodio is a bad instructor, but better suited for students who are naturally good at math and have a good understanding of foundational concepts. If you skip steps when you work out problems or do a lot of mental math, Prof. Amodio is probably a good fit for you. Don't be afraid to ask questions, he will help you! | the good reviews about this prof. seem to be written by himself. i mean seriously? lol | He's not bad but he's also not great. You believe he cares until you see the trick questions on the exam. He gives great tips and shortcuts that make sense. Pay attention to his recommendations. Not all of his exams are the same as his reviews. The average of all exams was 60. The course is hard, but be prepared to put in extra time and work. | Honestly, he's alright. The class in general is very hard and his lessons are more of just him doing problems on the board and the students watching. He expects everyone to already be experts at the topics which is annoying. Definitely a hard class to pass. | He is a funny, funny guy. He likes yapping in his class and throws up problems on the board saying, ""do them"" without any context. Istg this man is like the Kornieko of math. I genuinely advise you to never take this class, ever. Oh, and this guy has only become ""helpful"" after someone complained to the department. | DO NOT TAKE. This professor got angered at a question and made everyone fail that question. Because of this, the department had to regrade it manually | DO NOT TAKE JAMES AMODIO. This guy is a literal trap. On day 1 he will literally tell you, that everyone fails this class. All his lectures are a math show, where the students have a seat, and watch as he shows off his math skills. 0 explaining. 0 care about anyone's learning. NO CURVING. Class average was a 42.5 for the second test. Avoid him. | Skips steps in lectures, often times I lose braincells in his lectures. Genuinely he doesn't seem like he's knowledgable in his own subject. As such he is a funny guy (to mock) so if you want to have a fun time laughing at him (at the cost of your happiness and gaining the Depression condition- disadvantage on all of his lectures!) take his class. | Professor Amodio was one of the best math teachers I've ever had. Precalc at Rutgers is just generally hard, but he does his best to make it easy and he's really funny. He also posts his past exams on canvas and they're usually pretty similar to the actual exams. If you have to take this course I highly recommend taking it with him. | He is a really great professor. You really do need to pay attention in lecture in order to succeed, it really is important to listen to all the things he says. Pay attention to his suggestions. As long as you do exactly what he tells you to and you understand concepts you will be okay! He is very funny and a great prof. | all the glowing reviews for this professor were surely written by himself, I never had a professor act so much as if he blatantly did not care about his students learning. Thought he was too good to teach pre calc and was not shy about expressing it. would not take | Professor Amodio is an amazing Math teacher who wants success for all of his students, if you show up to lecture, take notes, and do the homework you will pass the class. | Awesome Professor! Professor Amodio is very caring and his teaching style is very effective. If you want to pass Pre-Calc 1&2 this is your guy. Appreciates his sense of humor and passion for teaching. Do the study guides for the exams! Overall great experience and not very hard. | Tests are straightforward, he gives you exam reviews, lectures aren't completely dry. Honestly, if you put in the work you will get a good grade. | made pre calc 112 a breeze, he posts exam reviews that are exactly like his exams which is very helpful!! overall his explanations are so easy to understand | I originally thought he would be a good teacher but he was just the opposite. All quizzes were copy and pasted from WebAssign and he really didn't seem to care about the content of the quizzes. What he taught was not what was on the 2 Exams and Final. He might be good for Pre-Calc or Calc, but definitely not Algebra. | I wish i can take him for every math class lol. I had him in the summer and I never thought I would get an A in the course I previously failed. But he really is amazing. His practice exams are the same as exams just with different numbers. So funny, and nice to just talk to about random stuff lol. | He was a great teacher had him during the summer very nice, sometimes funny went through lessons really quick. He also explains everything well and is all around great teacher would definitely recommend him he is a cool professor. | hes chill. you have to attend class or else your going to be lost in the course. he does a good job explaining things and is acessible. | Highly recommend. Easy to understand much better than the other Math professors. Study guides are basically the test with a couple of changed numbers. | Professor Amodio made math easier to understand and is definitely one of the best math professor at Rutgers. He is really funny and cares about his students, which is why he will answer all of the questions his students ask. The exams are similar to the study guide he gives. As long as you attend lectures, you will be fine. | He's alright, a bit snarky for some reason. Beware of trick questions on exams. I only gave him stars for accepting my late work once so that was nice I guess. | THE GOAT. He knows exactly how to teach us students in ways that we understand. He also gives past exams as study guides and they are super helpful! His lectures are also straight to the point and helpful. Chill and funny, the kind of math teacher everyone loves. The difficulty really depends on you and how good you are with math but he's the best! | Don't listen to these reviewers giving this class a 3/5 difficulty. I got an A and would give it a 4-4.5/5 difficulty. Math department at RU ranked top 20 in the world so math classes here are beyond difficult: more than half the class failed. He's the best option, but that doesn't mean this class is easy. Attend office hours and come prepared. | Best Math professor at Rutgers! Pre calc is hard but he makes it easy to understand. He is great at explaining this subject and makes sure that you understand what is going on. GO To Class and Do all the work, also office hours are very helpful if you don't understand. | This professor is just AMAZING. Math is a hard subject and I have never been good, but the way he teaches makes it easy or at least bearable to pass. He is a good teacher and makes the long lectures fun and entertaining. My favorite professor! He does not take attendance, but I would recommend to attend in order to better understand the material. | He's the one of the very few math professors that is always willing to help and knows what he is doing. He uses shortcuts to help you and precalc part 1 is weirdly difficult so I got an A because of his teaching style. Always go to office hours. | Greatest teacher ever for precalc at rutgers. He will show you shortcuts for solving problems. He will also get you ready for the final exam. He will give you similar for to review for exams. | Amodio was a great professor, wish I had him for 111. He's funny and is straight up with you. Attend office hours because they really help. Everything he does is for a reason, straight forward learning techniques and he helps you to better understand the topics. Of course you have to study but thats with all math courses. | Amodio is a pretty good guy. He knows that Pre Calc at Rutgers is one of the hardest classes so his way of teaching is extremely helpful. He's intimidating at times but it's for the best. First exam was the hardest for me.. second not bad and final is okay. Quizzes are fairly easy but be prepared to work for your grade and do not fall behind. | Precalc at Rutgers is hard as is so make sure you go to class. Don't really need the textbook but there is an ebook that comes with the webassign. Study the quizzes and review old exams if you can get it from someone who took it already, they help a lot. Amodio is a nice professor and tries to make the material as clear as possible for you. | One of the best professors here at Rutgers. Math is literally so difficult at RU and if you already have a hard time then 20/10 would recommend him. He actually cares about whether u get the material and take the time to answer any questions u have during class, after, or in his office hours. Great at teaching and enthusiastic | Amodio is a great Professor if you pay attention during his lectures and do the homework plus extra practice you should be fine. Dont skip out on classes or youll be behind also make sure to really study because his exams are hard. If you put effort itll go a long way and if you need extra help his office hours also helped me too. | Professor Amodio is the man! Precalc at Rutgers is very hard, but Amodio is very straightforward and makes learning easy. I learned so much in his class and never thought I was that good at math until I took him. He teaches you math the right way. I'm expecting an A in the class after taking the final. He is a 10/10 professor! | I am absolutely obsessed with this man. Took him for precalc 1 and he wasn't teaching precalc 2 this semester but there were things that were not making sense so I went to him a couple of times, and he helped me out even though he was under no obligation to. He is an amazing professor and a really good person. | Very snarky professor, but in a good way that he acts like your weird uncle. He's super straightforward with notes and happy to take questions (also please just humor him in lecture). I go to his office hours and he is very chill and glad to help! A lot of his past students actually come for his help with other math courses too lol | Very very nice guy. The material is fast and furious (he eve says that to you.) you gotta stay on top of the work !! The tests and final are hard and the final is a math depertment final so there is no getting around it. Make sure you understand the material and that you practice and do some more practice! | dudes funny and straightforward with the material, webassigns were 100 tries and show another version. tests based on homework | I took amodio for precal part 1&2. part 2 is easier for class exams but much harder on the final (part1 harder for class exam but bit easier for final). for the final u need to make sure you know everything from the beginning. if you want to pass this class, you better sit in the front and ask questions. thats how i passed precal | He's a really great teacher. If you don't understand something he'll explain it to you perfectly. However, if you have Beth as a recitation teacher, you're in trouble. She confuses students by teaching it a totally different way than Amodio and over complicates the problems and is very nit picky with the quizzes. To pass, you gotta know the stuff. | Hands down one of the best professors I have ever had at Rutgers. Pre calc is a dreaded class here at Rutgers but he makes sure students know what is expected of them on the exams and his reviews are always super helpful. He makes the class super fun and makes sure people understand what he is trying to explain. If you attend classes, you'll pass. | really good professor. his reviews for each exam are the exact same as the exam. go to his reviews before the exam, it really helps | I am literally obsessed with this man. Had him for both precalc 1 and 2 and I look forward to going to lecture because of him. He is so funny and after all this time I am just used to his teaching style. Listen to him and take advantage of how well he prepares you for the final. I will miss him dearly and wish he taught calc next semester :( | Best professor for Precalc part 1 & 2. He's a funny, caring professor and lecture halls are fun | Probably the best math professor you can have at Rutgers. Will definitely take him again if he teaches pre calc 2. | Makes math easy. He is super buff, I think he works out before he comes to class. He is always in a good mood and makes you want to learn. Be sure to ask questions, he will elaborate. Good lecturer, make sure to pay attention though. He isn't a difficult professor, but the material is challenging. | Took Precalc 112 with Amodio in Fall 2016, he's an amazing professor!! If you go to lecture, do the web assign, and use his review problems you'll do fine! Also, someone wrote that he's the only precalc prof to not curve, but Precalc does not curve in general (so there aren't any precalc profs that do a curve). He's great, I definitely recommend! | He's the only pre calc professor that doesn't curve anything, and probably has the hardest exams, so this class is not an easy A at all. I had with other professors that had easier exams and their exams were all curved. He's funny and nice, but this class was extremely hard. | Amodio is great. he spends all his time answering everyone's questions and know exactly how to teach. sometimes i dont like how he assumes you know the basic but make sure you attend all of his classes and ask questions! he will answer !! super nice! this class is made to be extremely intense so dont blame him and do all your work and more! | Professor Amodio was the most incredible professor I have had so far. I can honestly say I have gotten better at math since taking him, like actually better. He is hilarious, witty, engaging, and has tricks that make the hardest concepts so much easier. Beware of quizzes in this class, but if you study he is fair. I went to every single lecture. | He's a tough teacher. Precalc is no joke at Rutgers. His Teaching Assistant is absolutely horrible, so beware of that. The quizzes WILL catch you off guard. | Math was my worst subject, but after taking precalc with this professor, I got a lot better in math. He's extremely helpful, kind, and cares if you don't understand the material. He's seriously the best math teacher i've had at rutgers and i feel a lot more confident now in taking future math courses because of him | Great Professor. A bit sarcastic (funny tho) and goes a little too fast but he's honestly the best math teacher I've ever had. Before him I couldn't understand math and had anxiety but he really breaks things down for me to understand it and even teach others. Put a lot of work into this class, go to office hours, review quizzes, practice a lot | Before I took Pre-Calculus with Amodio, I absolutely hated and could not understand math, but Amodio really broke down concepts in a way that made me understand it. He's has a funny and efficient style of teaching. His exams reflect his study practice questions so put in a lot of effort , go to TA office hours, and you can get a B/A. TAKE HIM! | Favorite teacher I've had so far. I hate math, and he made it 100x easier. If you go to his office hours you'll be more than prepared for his hard exams. I recommend him!! | James was freaking awesome. I didn't do too well in the class, but that's just because math isn't my strong suit. However, he made it bearable. He's hilarious and is always available for extra help. His class helped me begin to understand math even though I'm not too good at it. In any case, I highly recommend this guy!! | Even if I fail pre-calc i would be more than happy to take the course again with this guy because he is just an awesome professor. He makes math seem easier than it actually is and if it weren't for the really ridiculously hard exams he would get a perfect score from me. You actually do need to do the practice problems and study. | Professor Amodio is an awesome precalculus professor. Many students think that he's going too fast on the material, but he's actually in the pace of where we are on the syllabus. He tries to make his lectures lively with his sarcastic comments mind you he's lecturing a huge class. Highly recommend attending his office hours if you need extra help."
"Unger, Laura","Professor Unger is amazing! I did not do to well on the first exam, but after studying more and attending office hours my understanding is a lot better, She is extremely organized and has everything right in front of you on canvas. If you stay on top of everything you will be fine! She is super funny and amazing at explaining things. Def take her! | Idk why people say she's condescending, if you don't act out she's perfectly nice. Probably the best at teaching and lecturing and suuuuuper organized. Amazing notes and really does want you to do well. | a very good math professor though she was very condescending. having a prof you feel comfortable asking questions too is very important especially in a class as hard as this one. felt like i would have done better in the class if i was not so scared to ask her anything, nonetheless she is still a good professor | Professor Unger is a great professor. Her teaching was simple to follow and easy to understand. She is generous with grades and wants the best for her students. However, at times, I felt that she was condescending, which made it harder for me to ask her questions. | She's a very tough grader. Not easy to approach and not particularly accommodating but she is a good lecturer | Shes a good teacher. Math is hard regardless the teacher but her notes are amazing. | Great teacher | I took Professor Unger for Precalculus 111 and unfortunately did not have a positive experience. She seemed unapproachable and lacked professionalism, often making students feel inadequate when they asked questions. Her teaching style was too fast-paced, and errors in her answer keys added confusion, making learning more difficult. | I took her for both 111 and 112 and I loved her. As someone that is bad at math she makes the information very clear and understandable. She provides work sheets that keep lectures organized and helps a lot when studying for exams. Only downside is that she isn't always the most approachable person. | Every math teacher needs to be like her. She's difficult to talk to but just do your work ON TIME (no extensions) and you will be fine. She is super organized and has all the class notes arranged well in Canvas, which is a blessing during exam week when you are rushing to find notes. The exams she makes are pretty fair but Rutgers makes the final. | She is so organized and really does her best to make sure students pass the class. She gave accurate study guides for all the quizzes and dropped our 4 lowest hw assignment grades and 2 lowest quiz grades. I feel like the only reason she has some low reviews is because she does not deal with misbehaving. | The best math professor I've had. She teaches very clearly and isn't trying to trick you. She is an easy grader and is there to help her students pass. Math is my least favorite class by far, but her lectures were good. Great professor, I wish I could take her for every math class. | Professor Unger is a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University. Her full-time job is as a high school teacher. Despite her full-time job, Professor Unger has always put in her full effort during lectures and shows a lot of care towards her students. If you want to pass pre-calculus, this professor will definitely help you out. | She was an okay teacher. I'm not great at math and tried to get a tutor which didn't help, then I went to her office hours and she wasn't any help either. For those who have to take math, I guess she is one of the better teachers since she gives extra credit. | Professor Unger is very straight to the point. Her lectures are very organized and she provided worksheets both physical and pdf versions. Her teaching style was very clear and efficient. She can be pretty blunt when asking her questions. Quizzes are very similar to the practice sheets she gives for them. I'd definitely take her again! | She is teaching a hard subject and is very open about what will be on the exam. She will call you out for not doing anything or being late so don't do that. She is good at explain topics and makes it easy to learn to tough material, and is open about what will be on test took the class twice now and she is better than my other teacher by far. | Terrible at explaining and will just speed through the lecture. Good luck with office hours, BTW | If you ever miss any kind of assignment for whatever given reason, this professor will not give an extension no matter what. If you die right in front of her she will expect you to have done the homework prior. Not a caring professor at all. However, she is good at teaching and her class is relatively easy. | Prof Unger was so nice and cared about her students fully understanding material. We had 3 exams total and quizzes every week. Exams are easy if you do review sheets she makes or the department ones. She is very funny and makes the class enjoyable. She gets to know students by name even in a big class. Would recommend her! | I loved this prof but I couldn't get used to her teaching style. Fast-paced & doesn't slow down regardless of class performance. The main goal is to get through material... somewhat helpful, but left no time to master or get good at a topic before touching another. No time to practice the difficult problems that would show up on exams or quizzes. | Unger is easily one of the best math teachers at Rutgers. She also teaches high school which is why I think she's a great teacher to have as a freshman, she explains thoroughly and often makes extra assignments and opportunities for credit. Highly recommend taking her, she is much more hands-on than other profs. | Unger is a good professor if you can handle fast-paced teaching. She is a little snappy but if you can see past that, she's a great teacher and willing to help (but not without an eye roll, dramatic sigh, or slick comment.) She very often makes little mistakes so check wrkshts graded by her. I'm choosing to take her again for precalc, I recommend. | Professor Unger isn't bad herself, but her teaching style wasn't the best at least for me. She is EXTREMELY fast and goes very quickly so for me there was a lot of self-teaching. She also marks down for the slightest mistakes and she had quizzes every week. | Professor Unger is a nice person. She seems to care, but is not always fair in grading. I don't think it's really her fault but rather the entire calculus I course being extremely and unfairly challenging. If the caluclus course was ran differently and the material was more reasonable, then maybe I would enjoy having her as a professor. | I took this class for Calculus 1 and Professor Unger was very kind. She was willing to help and made you smile, but this type of subject requires a LOT of patience with students. Most students in my class had no idea what to do and she seemed to be bothered when we asked a question. Overall, she is a nice person but is a tough grader. | She's the only reason I passed 111, her teaching method was straight to the point but she still went into detail if it makes any sense, if you needed help she was there to help out. | Prof. Unger is an okay teacher, she is a highschool teacher, so she is an adjunct. She can be snappy sometimes, but if she likes you will make accommodations. Show up to class on time, she will appreciate that. Most of the class is homework, quizzes, and then you have 3 tests. Her class is okay if you need it, but not my favorite. | She is such a phenomenal professor. She has an excellent way of teaching the math in a way that doesn't bore you and makes you really pay attention to her. Her way of teaching helps you comprehend the various topics covered. I easily went from an F to a B when I took this class with Unger. Highly recommend! | She is not very good | Math is hard in general but she teaches lecture style everyday and I was surprised at how much I was able to understand and take from her teachings. I went from a F in precalc to a B and I actually understand math now. Shes sarcastic but in the end just wants you to do the best and follow the rules of math. Def take her | She is a little snappy and I personally did not like the way she taught. I wouldn't recommend anyone taking her."
"Cochran, Geraldine","Best economics professor at rutgers! I also took this class in the summer, it gets a little hectic, but it's pretty easy the way she teaches it. She very understanding and crystal clear. I wanna take more classes with her | horrible class, taking it over the summer and she expects way too much. every class there is a quiz, and we have 3 labs and 3 tests, crazy for 6 weeks. I think she has never taught a summer session class before. | I took her for econometrics last semester. Shes super nice and helps alot! she explains with good examples! DEF take her | Cochran is the best professor you can have for econometrics. It is a lot of work labs, quizzes, homework. But all of that ends up boosting your great. Exams are decent. Extremely nice and helpful! Definitely take her!! | Cochran is a great instructor. Extremely helpful, kind, and clear. You have to work, but she makes it as easy on you as possible. Some professors in the Rutgers econ department are total jerks (coughcough Paczkowski coughcough)but if you stick with Cochran you'll be set. She's awesome and pretty cute too. | Really great professor. Keeps class interesting and exams are easy. If you have to take this class you should take it with her. Ive heard bad things about econometrics but she made it simple."
"Scheiman, David","Worst calc 1 teacher, didn't learn a thing attending his classes. Practically learned the whole semester by myself from the homework and YouTube. Even worse 9 times out of 10 he treats the class like a stand up comedy routine, just telling jokes 50% of the time. Don't take this class unless you want to be confused and have to teach yourself. | This is the best professor I have had so far at Rutgers. Everyday he would enter the class with enthusiasm and created such a loving and caring environment. While the class itself is difficult, Scheiman makes it bearable. I 100% recommend him if you're looking for a good time as well as manage to get an A with some vigorous studying. DO HW & ATTEND | Honestly coming into this class the reviews really scared me, but it wasn't too bad. He is a really funny guy which keeps class engaged but can be sarcastic when it needs to be serious. Drops the lowest quizzes and HW at end of semester. I finished with an 85 and he bumped my grade to a B+. Don't fall behind and get good quiz grades. | Terrible teacher. Yaps the whole class period and speeds through lessons knowing no one understands the material. Tests are extremely difficult, and you basically have to self-study for the whole class if you want to understand the material. Talks to students and makes jokes rather than explaining and teaching. | 115 is notorious with a 50% fail rate school-wide, however, Scheiman provides more leniency and character to the average 115 professor. His teaching style helps you understand certain formulas, that build on future chapters/Calc. His joyful and laidback attitude allows him to be more approachable for help. I wanted to switch, glad I did not. | I took him for calc I at Rutgers Newark. I saw the reviews before my first day of class, I got scared and tried to drop the class. I ended up taking the class with him, I don't regret it!!! He is such a great human being. I really suck at math and I ended up passing. He was good a teaching, he was always asking if we had questions. Nice prof | He doesn't teach well and teaches incorrectly or skips some concepts but he is funny. It's not worth going to his lectures because I didn't learn anything in fact I was more confused. I have to retake precalc now…I had a 75 until exam 3 my grade was 69.2 then I bumped it to 71.7 but after finals I got 65.27. I suggest choose a different lecturer. | If you can avoid him, do it. He is a funny guy but doesn't teach at the level you'd expect for the exams. I learned more from the TA than from his lectures. Just do yourself a favor and not take his class. | He's charming, funny, and very respectful--but I found myself learning more from my TA (especially regarding content on the exams) than Scheiman himself. Not the worst professor you can get for 115, but definitely not the best. | I don't suggest taking 115 with him. He does a fine enough job at teaching the material, but the exams are just crazy. The exams are almost nothing like what is shown in class, so you must understand the content deeply. The class average was always around 55% on exams. Not a good look. He's funny though. Pick another professor if you can. | DO NOT TAKE this class with scheiman I swear he is making his own 5 star reviews on here, do not be fooled. He is a comedian and even though he is sometimes funny, shi isn't funny when it comes to grades. The test reviews are a joke and minimal class prep- all self-study. Don't take my word but the class averages were all 55-60 for every exam. | Awful teacher, doesn't even teach just does examples and expects you to know what to do. The study guides are NOTHING like his exams they're completely different. DO NOT GET HIM | Easily the hardest course I've taken. He makes his exams so unnecessarily difficult and completely different from the practice material. It's almost impossible to study for this class because you have no idea what type of problem he'll include on the exam. Can't wait for the final—at least he won't be the one making it. | The lecture content was useless, and questions in the lecture were answered poorly. I learned more from the textbook and YouTube. Weekly quizzes were difficult, but midterm exams were ok. The given midterm exam prep content was useless. The final was easy and saved my grade. | Format of a couple test questions are….RLLY random since they weren't greatly emphasized in the lectures and 85% were clarified by my TA. And some were flat out random. Complete all the resources he gives out and ask questions. His tests are not hard. They're short and mostly logical. Otherwise, it's mostly just demanding outside work. | Student believes that Prof. Scheiman is about the best you can get from a math professor. All of his praise is well earned. The Calc II recitations (as of Spring 2024) were very challenging, but not taught by him. Stay on top of the homework or you're cooked. Very liberal with the grading. He is a very funny man. He owns turtles. | This class can be a struggle, but using resources like unstuckstudy ai alongside the textbook really helped me stay on top of the material. The professor has a specific teaching style, so staying engaged is key to doing well. | This prof is a very cool guy i just wish he was like my bio professor or something he would be very loved but hes unfournately a math professor | A great professor overall, great at teaching the material and answering questions. | I took this course over the summer, I have never been good at math and retook this course. I thought it would be impossible to pass but Professor Scheimann's energy makes it easy to engage in the material. He cares a lot about his students and will take the time to help you understand the material! 10/10 professor. | For basically my entire life, I've never paid attention to math classes. But Scheiman was engaging enough that I actually paid attention once in a while in a math class, which is a miracle for me. And even with the occasional entertaining personal anecdote thrown in, we were still always ahead of other sections and had review days before tests. | He is a great teacher; however, he has a habit of doing riddles when telling you what yu need to prepare for. It isn't very pleasant. But other than that, how he teaches helps you understand what is discussed. | He seemed preoccupied the majority of the semester. He came late, left early, and taught only basics. Look to screw on exams. | Honestly Prof Scheiman is a cool guy, but he's not a very good calc professor. He doesn't thoroughly explain things sometimes and does a lot of mental math. It's hard to keep up during lectures if you aren't a math genius. Minimal hw, 2 exams and a final. Exams are difficult and he doesn't really give extra credit. Idk if I'd recommend taking him. | The fact the FINAL LETTER GRADE AVERAGE FOR THE CLASS WAS A **D** even after quiz drops and homework drops says a lot about this professor. Stay away and pick a different professor if you don't want to sit in this class for two semesters. Trust me other professors actually care for the students. | Never thought I would be one of the people saying this in a ratemyprofessor but... Do not make the same mistake I made and pick a different professor this prof clearly barely cares about this class. | I absolutely hate him. Hes the worst. He doesn't care to further explain his problems. He goes way too fast during his lecture. I wish I never taken his class because it was a waste of my money. Classes often ended early or cancelled. Is anyone in the math department paying attention? | hello, me from review below. forgot to mention... It's like this ""prof."" feels good about his students failing. After all exams, he would always mention the average scores and joke about how low they were! What an awful experience! | The good reviews about this guy must have been written by himself. LOL. I mean, seriously? Great comedian, not teacher. Avoid or you'll regret it, like me D: | He writes on the board with chalk and you can never understand his handwriting, he skips steps and makes unnecessary jokes that aren't funny to take away from the little teaching he does because he like to finish lectures as soon as possible. I just don't recommend him because this class will make you loose motivation in everything else. | Not a good option at all. You will struggle badly compared to another different professor. He makes this class unnecessarily hard. | STAY AWAY FROM HIS CLASSES!!! DON'T FALL FOR RATINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY NOT WRITTEN BY STUDENTS!!! LITERALLY 75% OF THE CLASS **FAILED** EXAMS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT COMPARED TO THE OTHER PROFESSORS AND HE DOESNT TEACH!!!! | This professor makes the course more lighthearted and is open to questions/comments/concerns. His classes are always interesting/fun to attend. He dropped 3 quizzes, 5 homeworks, and gave the class a bonus 100 on a quiz. The average of my class was a D irregardless. The material/curriculum is no joke for precalc 115. Extremely fast-paced course. | Horrible | Awful | Save your self an F or D in your transcript. This class is already difficult & It makes it even more difficult when you can't read what he puts on the board. All you see is smudges of eraser marks from the previous class & his handwriting is bad. He cuts class too early & at the end of the semester bombards you with old lecture videos to catch up. | PLEASE don't fall for the good reviews like I did!! I saw his reviews before the fall 2023 semester started, and I said, ""WOW! Let me take this professor."" Pick a different professor, like Steven Safran. Trust me, stay away from this one! If you take his sections you ARE DOOMED!!! THE EXAM AVERAGES ARE ALWAYS F OR D- | This ""professor"" (more like comedian) clearly does not want to do anything math related except make his jokes and talk about what he wants to do after class. Clearly doesn't want to be here and is just here for extra cash. The fact he has 5 stars is baffling... I would not be surprised if he writes his own reviews because look at the reviews below | Too busy to be bothered to teach us, and we needed the help | Useless | Expectations were clearly set in the rubric, that being said he does expect a lot of prep work from students in terms of homework and studying. Exams carry a majority of the weight, but Scheiman's lectures helped a lot, really good at explaining core concepts. He didn't drop the two quizzes, but instead he added one everyone got 100 which helped. | Professor promised us 3 quiz & 5 homework grades will be dropped... didn't happen. Professor promised us extra credit for solving his tricky riddles.... didn't happen. He is not a man of his word. I worked unnecessarily hard because after his first exam i realized that the questions were not from HW or lecture and the book so spend 25 hours weekly. | Do not take this class based on the good reviews. As others have mentioned this professor cares more about his paycheck rather than helping students. He makes random jokes during lectures, ended the class early on numerous occasions, and deceitfully claimed that three quiz grades and five homework grades would be dropped. | Most chill professor for pre calc he makes it much easier for students to learn. | Took 115 in my first semester at Rutgers, I was worried cause I'm not a strong math student but professor Scheiman made the course so enjoyable. His lectures were extremely engaging and made them fun to attend. The exams were hard if you do not study for the material, but if you put in the effort you will see a return. Highly reccommend taking him | SIKE take someone else. Do not be fooled by the 5 stars. Ace the class or not take someone else. Least inspirational professor. | He is very funny | His class has to be the worst I have taken in my life.This is the first time I had a professor give me the feeling that he doesn't want to even be here. Barely wants to answer questions; he can't even focus on math teaching for 5 minutes before going off topic about the most random things. He always cuts the class very early. Not a good experience | Scheiman is a great professor. He clearly knows his stuff, and he doesn't BS about the material. He teaches you what you need to know, and thats it. That is good, in my opinion, because you can go home and then learn the material via the homework and other videos. Take him if you are capable of helping yourself. | This professor teaches at a high school that is 22nd in the whole nation, and he admitted before giving us an exam that they took as well and talked about how their exam average was double ours. How are we getting the same exam that the top 20 in the nation out of 23,499 high schools? The exam averages are always a D- or F. Take another prof trust. | He is absent a lot and is always complaining and literally stops in the middle of lecture to tell jokes that are not even funny. Teaches and bare minimum and doesn't even help you. I started attending Professor Safran's classes and am finally nearning the material. | He is very funny, but I am here for math, not a comedy show. Class gets cut a MINIMUM of 20 minutes early often. It is very hard to see the board from even the 2nd and 3rd rows, as all you see are eraser marks from the previous class that he wrote over, and his handwriting makes that problem even worse. Stay away and choose a different professor. | Not a good option. Seems to be there to collect a paycheck | Class constantly ended late or cancelled. Thank god for Professor Volpe the TA who can actually teach us. | The good reviews about this professor are complete BS. I literally think he is the one making the good reviews. This professor is awful at teaching. Reads off the book. Doesn't go in-depth with the examples in class. Most classes are ended early. Stops multiple times during class to tell jokes. Don't think about it twice, take someone else! | Constantly telling jokes in the class, stops half way through a problem just to say something completely unrelated. It is frustrating, annoying and distracting. Doesn't go in depth with examples. Hard to reach outside of class. Goes too fast through lectures. Reads off the book and doesn't explain concepts well. Do no take him! | Scheiman was a great professor, he explains the material very well. In my case however, I find it difficult to learn math which resulted in a low grade in the course due to many quiz grades below 70% Despite this, he makes lectures enjoyable and genuinely cares/wants his students to succeed which is sadly not always the case with math profs. at RU. | lectures always cut short/cancelled and professor read straight from the textbook. took random points off exams without explanation. no partial credit and no credit if you don't box your answers. you could show all of your work and get the correct answer and somehow still get a 0. final was 40% of grade. 20+ pages of homework a week. | Too many classes ended early or canceled. This is what I'm paying for? | Professor Scheiman is probably the best, if not, one of the best, math professors at Rutgers. He is an amazing teacher and his lectures are extremely engaging because he is the funniest person ever. He answers questions clearly and really wants you to pass so reach out for help. I only didn't do too well because of my recitation instructor. | Professor Scheiman seems like a nice guy. He ended lectures early on multiple occasions. His lectures are nothing compared to the homework making it a lot harder to complete. His exams were also nothing like what he taught us. I would get 100s on every quiz in recitation and would fail his exams. He will also never answer your emails or texts. | A great professor at Rutgers, the lectures was easy to understand & will always take his time to answer questions if you were still having trouble. Even though attendance is not mandatory, students still show up because he makes the class enjoyable, not gonna lie though his exams are harder, but it helps out when you take the final. | Great professor overall clearly cared about his students and class. Very engaging and dedicated! | Professor Scheiman is great, he can go off topic at times but goes back usually right away. The class could be tough for first year students as I failed my first two tests but started studying more after the second and saw a lot of improvement. I feel like the final was easier than his tests too so make sure you study and ask questions. | Very challenging course. Professor Scheiman's banter makes it a lot more tolerable, though his lectures are difficult to comprehend if not actively asking questions. The fact that the only part of the course which is curved is the final doesn't help matters much either. Overall, if you need to take Precalc, definitely recommend him. | Nice teacher but teaches the bare minimum, exams have topics we didn't learn, same with homework. The average for all of the exams are in the 50s or below, and he doesnt curve. Guarantee at least 80% of the class is failing or in danger of failing. | He is absent a lot and is always complaining and literally stops in the middle of lecture to tell jokes that are not even funny. Teaches and bare minimum and doesn't even help you. Take someone else. | HE is GREAT; nothing more needs to be said. BEWARE, HOWEVER, the recitation professor JoAnn Kennedy IS HORRIBLE. Take his class with a different TA. She doesn't even know math and cannot administer quizzes. Verrrrry lazy. Does not go over important things like for quizzes and exams in class and is not willing to listen to student disputes on grades | Professor Scheiman definitely is definitely a good and responsible teacher. His classes are very interesting and the atmosphere is very lively. And he is very detailed in explaining the knowledge points, and he will help us understand the knowledge points through many examples. I will choose him again if I meet him in the future! | Professor Schieman is very approachable. He's very straight forward when answering and is nonjudgmental towards students. He tended to go off topic several times during lectures and doesn't delve too far into the all of what you need to know. Study his material AND the book material AND GO TO RESITATION if you find that you're not getting it."
"Frankie, Joseph","Had him for recitation, and you need to be loud enough so he can hear you. I liked the way he explained the questions I had. Sometimes, he would make mistakes, but I make sure to call him out before he does it again without realizing it. | he genuinely didn't know what he was talking about during recitation and would literally get his own problems wrong and would have to redo it once a student pointed it out. teaching was unclear and hard to follow. reading the textbook is recommended. | He didn't respond to questions effectively and leaves barely any time for quizzes. | I had him for recitation, and he was very sweet and caring; however, he never actually responded to questions students had on the material, which I would attribute to age (but I am not certain of that, nor can I be). He often spoke too long and left little time for our quizzes, making grades suffer. | Does not show up for office hours, ever. Constantly makes mathematical mistakes during recitation while going over problems. These were the first of the issues. Later on, he was not willing to accommodate to my medical concern by allowing me to make up a quiz. Quote, ""I will not be making a special trip just to administer you a quiz."" | Professor Frankie was a very sweet man. I had him for recitation for precalc 115. | Honestly, it's an easy class. I just really didn't do anything. If you put in the time, like 1 or 2 hours a day, you will most likely get an A. Also do the exam reviews, they are legit like the real exams. | Good professor. | Take notes in lecture, ask questions in both lecture and recitation. Really nice dude and will answer your question and make sure you understand it. Quizzes are like 20 min before class ends. Do the work, and you will do fine. | This man, this god, Joesph Frankie, is a walking legend! He is super caring, respectful, gives amazing feedback, and won't start a quiz until all of our questions have been fully answered. I cry that I will never see this man again (as I am taking Calc151 next year). Frankie, if you ever read this, pleaseeee be a TA for Calc151. <3"
"Hirsch, Lewis","That Russian dude is one crazy cosmanate | This class was a joke. She's unorganized and boring. She takes attendence too, but take her for an easy A if you study and go to recitations. | She was standoffish and boring. I went to her for clarification and recieved no help whatsoever. Ionas was AWESOME. He truly wanted the class to succeed. She was rude to him, because he tried to help so much | she goes off track easily.....but the TAs are very helpful, esp Ionas...that's y she hates him so much...lol | wow. i pretty much agree with what everyone else said. i got notes from someone who used first class and they were so different from what she didn't teach in class and it actually helped and i actually learned!!! | Downright terrible, a nice person, but essentially useless, gives new meaning to a woman's place is in the kitchen | It really is all about the TAs...The only reason to show up for lectures was to sign in on the attendence sheet that she passed around periodically. | Prof Lewis did not know a thing about this subject. If you ever take this course make sure to have the TA Ionas, he is the man! will take care of you and make things clear, he's socially awkward, but a genius. class was very easy though | Ionas was a great teacher. Oh wait, that was my TA. Prof Lewis didn't know anything about this course whatsoever. Thank god for Ionas bc he made it more interesting and helped out alot | Got absolutely nothing from lectures...and she took attendence! Thank god for the TA's...ionas was great. | She has to be the worst professor Rutgers has to offer. Without Ionas (my TA) I wouldn't have learned anything! The only reason she has any information to ramble on about is because her TA's called out in class to correct her mistakes. HORRIBLE PROF!! | She's really smart, but you would never guess. If Ionas is your TA, prepare for a rough ride; he's an interesting one. | No Comments | Awful. The way she lectures makes me feel like I have ADD. | One of the nicest people I met at Rutgers. | comparative politics- it was all about the ta's- they knew the information and basically taught the class | She's insane, but in that way that almost makes you want to go to class. | Her TAs, Mike Rossi & Ionas really did everything for comparative politics"
"Menke, Michael","Excellent teacher. Teaches Linear Algebra in a clear and easy to understand manner. Allows students to learn from their mistakes. Definitely one of the best math teachers I have ever had. | Calc 3 sucks, but Menke got me through it. Menke's lectures were straight forward and he went at a steady pace and he also didn't assign as much work as other calc 3 profs I don't think. Was lenient on the MatLab and always pushed Homeworks. | Very straightforward and considerate professor. Makes it clear what to expect on the exams and quizzes, he tested us on some proofs towards the end, but they were not bad at all. His lectures are very good as well, easy to understand and follow along. Def recommend taking him if you can. | Professor Menke is probably the easiest math professor I've ever had. He is very straight forward, and all exams and quizzes are open notes. Although homework can be very long at times, if the effort is put in to do them, you will get an A. A decent lecturer as well, even though some self studying will be required. He doesn't teach you everything. | Best math professor I have had at Rutgers. He makes Diffeqs very very easy to understand; Menke is a very fair grader and answers questions well. I would definitely recommend taking math with Professor Menke. | He was a great professor, made it the easiest mathematics class I have taken so far. The material wasn't too bad to learn, and the lectures did a great job of teaching the material, and worked well with going through book problems at the same time for extra practice. | Professor Menke is very nice and very straight-forward. His class was honestly a breeze and the best calculus class I had so far. He explains everything very clearly and is also very welcome to answer any questions. I recommend going to all the lectures and recitations and you should definitely pass without a problem. | Probably one of the best math professors I've had at Rutgers. He teaches in a really organized and effective manner. His lectures are easy to follow, and honestly, if you just go to class and take notes, you'll definitely do well. Exams and quizzes are straightforward. Just do practice problems here and there and you'll be more than fine. | Professor Menke was a really nice guy. He taught well and all of his classes were lectures for Calc. However, the tests were extremely hard and not what we went over during lectures and recitation days. He gave quizzes every week. Attendance for lectures isn't mandatory, but for recitation it is. | Gives really unfair tests. The test had things that are 10x harder that what we did in class. Also, he gave the same test to three classes so some people knew whats on the test before taking it which is unfair. He is good at teaching, always prepares ahead, but he should do harder examples in class, and give fair tests. Just to know what to expect. | Professor Menke was a really good instructor. I failed calc when I first took it but he really explained the concepts well, starting out with explaining the basics and then building up to more advanced concepts. Calc is obviously a very difficult class so you have to put in work on your own, but Prof. Menke was really good and I'd recommend him. | Slightly boring, but very informal. Every class is a lecture. Goes through in detail. HW online & graded, but for each problem you get 5 tries. Attendance not mandatory, i skipped here & there and got an A, although I am a ""math person"". Many of my friends struggled, but just do the hw and pay attention. Hes really nice and straightforward."
"Abadir, Rasha","An amazing woman who always finds the positives amidst her busy life. She is very caring and wants us to do well in the class. | solid professor. attendance isnt mandatory but you need to go to get a quiz grade | I think she was an amazing professor. I had her for prep of calculus and she taught really well and was really understanding. I would love to take her class again. Class was difficult. All you had to do is practice the homework and worksheets that she assigns and you'll be good to go. Appreciate her understanding and she was quite lenient. | Great recitation professor. It is basically all group work but she is helpful if you have any questions, and teaches when necessary. Weekly quizzes end each class so your grade will go down if you don't go. | She is an amazing calc teacher and it'd be a no-brainer to pick her. | Good professor. Sometimes quizzes are easy sometimes hard. Prepares you for the exams. | Professor Abadir is really kind, caring, and enthusiastic about math. She holds one-two office hours per week, which are helpful if you have any questions. Her lectures are organized and introduce the concepts well. However, make sure to practice well for this course, especially with Dr. G's study materials (since he is the course coordinator). | Professor Abadir is excellent. She teaches by having you try problems on your own, followed by going through them step by step. The recitation quizzes she designs are not too bad as long as you really know the material. She answers any questions you ask and explains concepts clearly. Definitely take her if you can! | Professor Abadir has a genuine passion for teaching, she makes an effort to ask her students what she could do better and listens and applies feedback to her future classes. Calc is a hard class but her method of teaching makes you want to engage and attend lectures. I recommend taking her she is very understanding and enjoyable to be around. | Professor Abadir is definitely one of the best Calc professors at Rutgers. Calc is a hard class regardless but she's genuinely one of the better professors to teach it. She goes over each problem in detail and makes sure everyone understands each step. If you have to take calc, definitely go with her. | Amazing professor! | Professor Rasha Abadir was great. She is very helpful, caring, fair, and professional. Would definitely recommend taking a course with her! | I took professor Abadir in my high school for pre-calc and she was a really good teacher. I took her again for recitation for Calc 135 and she was one of the best. If you did not understand a problem she would immediately come and help you. When it came to exam questions she was very helpful and made it easy to understand. | This professor helped me when it came to studying for the exams. She is always willing to help with recitations and after class as well. In addition, she walked through problems on the board clearly and concisely, which helped when I reviewed the past exams later on. | Prof Abadir was my recitation teacher for Calc135 and she is easily the best TA I have ever had at Rutgers. You can tell that she wants us to succeed and she genuinely cares about us. If you want to do well in calc, try to sign up for her for recitation or go to her office hours. | I had her for my recitation and I think because of her I am gonna have an A in this class. She explains everything well and will go over any problem requested in great detail. Do yourself a favor and make sure she is your recitation professor if you wanna do well in this class. | The content was definitely not easy, but Professor Abadir does a great job of explaining. Her weekly quizzes are also very straightforward and clearer than other professors. Definitely would recommend if taking Calc 135. | She explains the course material very well and answers questions in a clear and succinct manner. Would 100% take again! | Thank you, professor Abadir. | She was super nice and frankly if it wasn't for her, I wasn't going to pass this class. She made the concepts easier to understand and took the time to teach the concepts we needed to know before giving us the quizzes. She cared about preparing us for the exams and quizzes by showing us how to answer questions so that we would receive full credit. | I took her class in Fall of 2021 and I'm so glad I did. Her lectures were so organized and she really explains everything thoroughly to make sure you understand. She breaks down the problems step-by-step and gives lots of practice problems. There's homework and a quiz each week. If you do the homework, you'll get a good grade on the quizzes. | Calc is a difficult subject for me & compared to my last calc prof, she was much more organized & clear. Every lecture you knew what she was teaching & what you are expected to know. She also provides examples at the end of each lecture which I found to be useful. She explains concepts well & helps you prepare for exams better than the other profs. | Great professor, she explained the course material very well and went through problems step by step. The course was hard and you need to do a good amount of studying on your own but that is on the Math department. She was awesome and focused on application of concepts and understanding concepts which was very helpful. | I am horrible at calculus but that is not Prof's fault. She actually was a very good teacher, slowly shows each step and makes sure students understand all the little steps. Calculus at Rutgers is just very hard for no reason. Tests not like the HW or class work, way harder. Very nice tho | Professor Abadir is one of the best Calc professors. As a course, calc is absolutely brutal but Abadir is honestly a lifesaver. Her lectures are amazing,so helpful,she always covers the actual content. I had her for hybrid in Fall 2021, so I had her lectures online which were all recorded. Her review lectures are AMAZING and all exam type questions | I think she's an okay professor, she goes over all sorts of problems during lectures, so definitely don't skip class. I think she's kind of rude though when you ask a question or if you're unclear she gets kind of annoyed. If you wanna do well pay attention, do the online homework, and don't skip recitation or lecture. | The main homework was the math labs that are due every Sunday midnight and recitation quizzes. Her lectures are organized and does baby steps to make sure the student knows where a # is from. She can be funny sometimes. The exams are EXTREMELY hard, but that is not in her control."
"Sarker, Shorab","Sarker is an excellent professor. No idea why is rating is so low, he gives many examples and practice homework AND drops hints of what's on the midterm and final. His slides are crazy long but if you attend class he goes over what's relevant and does important examples. He goes at a good pace snd makes sure students are understanding. | Dr. Sarker is a true gem. Explains all concepts so clearly thoroughly and makes sure to tell you what types of questions will be on the final/midterm so you can prepare as you learn. His weekly online tests are free marks and help you get a good idea of the types of questions that will be on the exams. Couldn't have asked for a better prof | Sarker isn't as bad as people say he is, but you should know a few things. His lectures teaches simple lessons, but the homeworks and his exam questions are going to be much more complicated. Getting used to the high-school basic maths and doing those homeworks is necessary! Go to his office hours if you have issues, he teaches real well there. | Dr Sarker is overall a good prof. His lectures made the concepts easy to understand, but some of the assignment and exam questions felt like they came out of nowhere, and most who didn't take a previous calc class probably wouldn't know how to do. His final exam was pretty rough, if you do not practice related rate and curve sketching have fun. | Dr. Sarkar's classes are painfully slow and unclear. He either over-explains or under-explains concepts and dismisses questions with ""it's high school math."" He ignores criticism. His tests lack a comprehensive formula sheet, expecting students to remember 50+ formulas. Overall, Dr. Sarkar seems to not care about student education. | Sarker in my opinion was a great professor when I attended lectures. His midterm and finals should be easy if you attend his classes and study in your free time. I didn't attend much which did hurt in the end but the key to success is paying attention and doing outside work. If you do, expect good things coming. If not, you'll be average. | W prof. right here. His midterm was a joke. He makes concepts extremely easy to take in and absorb. Participate in class, and I can guarantee you will do well. | Dr. Sarker is a tough grader and his lectures are somewhat difficult to follow although he is a very solid teacher. If you want to succeed in this class stay on top of the weekly assignments and lessons and study the previous midterm/exam. | Lovely professor, is passionate about what he's teaching, integral was quite hard with him but calc 1 was amazing, his midterms are quite full so most of what we saw in class will come, its pretty cumulative | I LOVE YOU SARKER! | Before I took his class I was warn by many others that he was tough, hard and awful. However, his lecture are not only easy to understand but also very informative. If you understand the examples he does in-class, you'll do extremely well on the midterm. His midterm is exactly what you are taught in class or in his assignment or review. | Amazing person! Smiley and positive, he has his slides online which is amazing, his office hours are so helpful he actually explains in details, make sure to read the slides before going to class because it is a little overwhelming but he explains clearly and you can keep asking questions. I had his first semester and second semester first year. | Don't listen to every1 else. Sarker really cares: online review before every exam, hundreds of practice questions and always willing to explain something to you after class. Sure he is a little harder than the other math profs but he did curve integral calculus GENEROUSLY (I went from 86-93). | Very knowledgeable, and passionate about what he does. The exams were tough. The final was made much more difficult when compared to the classwork provided. He was willing to curve a low-class average, however. Somewhat difficult to understand when explaining complex solutions, but YouTube cleared most things up. Hard work pays off with sarker. | Does not care about students. Terrible at grading and communication. | He claims that everything is ""high school math"" and basically expects you to know everything. If you do ask him a question, he might answer it, or he might say ""its too easy"" and wont bother explaining. He is very unorganized and his lectures notes are IMPOSSIBLE to follow. So dont even bother trying to take notes. DO NOT recommend him as a prof. | His lectures consist of slideshows that are each over 100 slides long that are always out of order and are super hard to follow which makes it hard to follow along/take notes. Hes also very hard to understand. His exams are fairly difficult but he gives you nearly no formulas/equations which makes them much harder. Would NEVER take his class again! | Dr. Sarker is a wonderful professor with lectures that can be interesting or hilarious at times. He provides optional homework in brightspace as well as practice midterms and exams, you have all of the tools needed to succeed in this class if you are willing to put a little bit of effort into practicing problems outside of class. | I had this professor for differential calculus and integral calculus. Integral calculus was far worse. The first day of class he said that the class average for this course was 40%. The exams were absolutely brutal, and the classes themselves were quite boring with them being made up of him just going through a PowerPoint at an inconsistent pace. | When you ask him a question in the lecture he replies with its basic high school math. 200% if you have him you are in for a disaster :(. | You better know background knowledge from High School because he skims over and expects you to know every detail even if you were not taught the material. Very hard to understand | His lectures are good but loud, he does easy examples in class but the questions given on homework and samples are complicated. However, his exam questions are not as complicated as the sample. | smh | Integral part is very easy if you keep up with the lectures, series and sequences get difficult. Do homework. His midterms and finals are fair. | Dr. Sarker is a good professor. Lectures are good, he's very thorough and passionate about what he teaches, and he's good at answering questions. His exams are fair but also challenging. | He has a heavy accent and it is hard to understand him. | Sarker's live classes were super useful and he would happily go through course content and questions. He also provided lots of optional practice questions to help prepare for the midterm and final, and his pre-recorded lectures are also helpful. | While I'm sure Sarker is a great professor in person, online is a different story. Most if not all of the recorded lectures are terribly paced, and his tendency to smack his lips and breathe into his microphone makes lectures something to dread. The actual lecture slides are sometimes confusing. His live sessions are very helpful if you can attend. | Sarker is a good professor, although while I took this class online all lectures are pre recorded videos. The marks for homework are automatic through Mobius and are not reviewed so must be accurate. HW-25%, MT-35%, Final-45%. He gives strict marking on MT and Final and grading is inconsistent, although classes are good time to get help | Extremely disorganized. Doesn't follow syllabus. | I had Dr. Sarker for Integral, winter 2021. Integral is probably the hardest thing I have ever done. The professor did the best he could, made lectures and posted them on time, as well as gave a lot of homework (unmarked) and practice tests to review. The course is hard but more than the professor, you need to do the homework and understand it. | Horrible, just horrible. All classes are pre-recorded lectures, need to use ""Mobius"" to grade all assessments (which will mark correct answers as incorrect unless you use a certain format) and exams are way more difficult than questions in class. Do not recommend. | This class is difficult and he is less available online. | This course is as easy as you make it. If you do the homework he gives out, then you will be fine for the exams. | Completely asynchronous lectures. Does not provide difficult examples to learn from. | He is an amazing professor. Absolutely a gem and can be very very funny at times. If you don't like Math he will make it more enjoyable, guaranteed. Uses lots of examples to explain things. Overall great professor and a great guy. | Somewhat scary and difficult, though really funny sometimes. Great for students with prior knowledge of calculus. You are able to ask question during the lecture, and get good answers (in my opinion) which can help clarify points. | Horrifying Experience. | I had Dr. Sarker for differential and integral calculus. Dr. Sarker teaches quickly but he gives you everything you need to do well. His tests are hard if you don't do the homework or quizzes. If you pay attention in class and practice you can do well. His class average is high in differential but around a 50 in integral (all profs do, its not him) | A very hard prof who sometimes rushes examples and makes hard midterms and finals but he curved the grade a lot at the end. Sarker if you're reading this sorry for hating all semester I love u thanks for curving it so much <3 | midterms were extremely hardcore and difficult. He rushes when teaching and uses easy examples compared to what are on his assessments. class average right now is 50%... | He is a smart, intelligent prof who is teaching a hard class and teaches ok, however, he has a very hard exam compared to his mid hard 1st midterm and easy 2nd midterm. | Not hating on him but he isn't the best professor out there, he teaches topics very quickly like you should know them, yes this should be a review for high school students but if you're teaching a 4-month course at least explain the topic rather than simple basic grade 1 examples. He makes the tests hard and completely different from his homework | Very intelligent individual and is passionate about the subject. Runs through the material like you already know it which is really discouraging. Does the easiest in class examples but gives out the hardest problems on his assessments. Keep up with homework and don't be afraid to go to his office hours. Scary man in class but kind one-to-one. | He's on okay prof. Turned out to be an easier marker than people made him out to be, maybe because so many other people were failing class. Not a big fan of his humour, threw around ""just kill yourself"" a few times. Not very funny and in poor taste. He is intelligent, and loves to see his class engaged. He will help if you need it, so don't be shy. | Had him for differential calc and now i have integral calc with him. Didnt try to hard in Diff Calc and I scraped by with a 60. Doing integral right now. Ive been keeping up with the quizzes and been doing so much better! Get a solid foundation of your high school math, keep up with the homework and practice, and show up! Youll do great! | A funny and kind professor, who has amazing lectures. Also, he is a hard marker. | Fantastic professor. People who give him a bad rating need to be spoon-fed to succeed. Sarker designs his courses so that you have to understand the concepts taught in class, along with everything that is a prerequisite. If you pay attention, and try to actually learn what the class is about, you will get an amazing grade. Take his class seriously | Apparently everything he teaches is ""high school math"". Gives insanely easy examples in class, when he does give a decently tough question he doesn't even do it all. | He's an extremely tough grader with inconsistent marking schemes. His lectures are very long, often going a few minutes over time. He covers many examples, but skips the bulk of each math problem and simply says ""oh you can do this yourself"" or ""high school math"" instead of explaining what he is doing. 2 midterms, both 25%, and the final, 50%. Bad. | This is the most difficult class that I have ever taken. Jing Wang's exams are easier so try to get her. Midterms each worth 25% and final 50%. So far we have a failing class average and is not helpful when you have questions. His answers often is ""do your homework"" or ""high school math"" when you ask a question"
"Tabanli, Sheila","Calc was one of the hardest classes I've taken. I was going to drop the class because I did really bad on the first midterm. She motivated me to stick with it and I increased my score every exam after that. Such a nice lady! I would highly recommend her teaching. She was always willing to answer questions! | Listen, Calc 135 at Rutgers is hard, no matter the teacher. I had Dr. Tabanli as a professor my second time taking Calc 135, and I took the class over the summer. I have to say she made the class less dreadful and gave us plenty of resources to succeed. She's quick to respond to emails. If I were to take calculus again, I'd take it with her again. | I would recommend Mrs. Tabanli as anyone professor | Worst profesor taken! She is very unclear on what she wants on the quizzes and if she is clear she will still manage to take points off your quiz. Ask her a question she yaps about it for 10 minutes and manages to not answer the question. She mentioned if she didn't teach it she won't make it pop up on a quiz/test but not true. Study the textbook. | Simple and useful class to better your understanding of how to better learn math. If you complete the assignments with minimal effort you'll get an A. Super nice professor | Always holds office hours, but try to sit in the front of the class. She does not wear a mic in the lecture hall and sometimes writes on the whiteboard, so it was tough to see what she was doing. There were some lectures technical difficulties occurred, but she could adapt and make it interactive with her students. Very underrated. | Ngl, I never went to lecture, but she seemed like a lovely lady when I saw her during the exams. As long as you watch Dr. G's YouTube videos and take his practice exams, an A is very attainable. I'm unsure if it'll be the same in the future, but the TA assigned to her recitations this semester was very helpful. | Calc is a rlly hard course but the prof makes it easier. She posts all her notes on Canvas but mainly works on Dr. G's manual in class so her lecture notes are similar to what will be on the exams. She answers emails very quickly and has many office hours. She truly cares about the students and will remember you. Best prof :) | Best professor I've taken at Rutgers. She genuinely cared about her students, lectures were engaging and she prepared us well for the exams. If you go to lectures, actively listen, and go to office hours and ask for help you should end with an A. | Take her for calc over the summer. great professor and will ensure you understand the material | best calc professor, she is more than ready to help you in order for you to bag that A. Attend office hours and email her if you have any questions. | I heard the scary stories about Calc at Rutgers, but honestly my experience was pretty good. Professor T was super sweet and forthcoming, she'd always answer my questions after class and was engaging. I highly recommend! | Great prof who genuinely cares about student learning. I liked how she made her lecture notes and many exam reviews available. She was very energetic and delivered amazing lectures, clarified questions when someone asked. I totally recommend her for calc! | Her notes are messy and not at all at the level of the notes you will see posted online from some good professors. She teaches you how to do certain types of problems but often doesn't cover the WHY aspect of them. Easy grader but not in depth. | Dr. Tabanli's teaching style made math easy. Her lectures are easy to follow, she uses multiple examples to let you understand the point. She's approachable and loves when students ask questions, and you will get extra credit if you engage in class. Quizzes and exams closely match class examples. I strongly recommend her class! | She is a very dedicated prof, helped me to understand complex concepts. If it was not for her teaching style and willingness to help, I may not have passed the class. | Dr. Tabanli's lectures are easy to understand and she encourages students to participate for extra credit. Her quizzes are on material similar to the examples that she gives in class and most of the exams are like this as well. She is very easy to approach and loves when you ask questions. | Professor Tabanli made the class seem easy in the beginning and then took a turn. Very tough grader and and wants things done her way. Will encourage you to participate in class and makes the quizzes tougher than they should be. The final exam was terrible and you need to review beyond the material she has taught. | Wants things done her way only. Will not listen if you have a different solution. Made errors constantly herself. | She should really concentrate on math in her classes, too much buzz words too little content. | She made this class engaging which almost felt like a high school course. I had no regrets about going to the lectures because not only did it help me understand calculus more, but she went beyond to motivate us to do well in all of our courses by teaching us techniques for how to learn any type of math better and giving us study tips. | Dr. T's teaching style made calculus easy to understand. She would write down ""steps"" to follow and it made it much easier to solve problems keeping those steps in mind. She would give lots of problems and solve them, so it really locked in the info. She curves the class, encourages questions, and drops hws and recit quizzes. Would take again. | Dr. T had a wonderful teaching style that was easy to follow. She taught by writing the entire chapter, which made it easy to understand the process of getting to the answer. One of the things I liked most was how she solved a lot of problems, so you'd understand the material more. She encourages questions and never fails to attend to her students. | I began this course with a negative view of calculus due to my high school experience. However, this course became the easiest one I took this semester. I owe this to Professor Tabanli, whose warm and caring teaching made math approachable and enjoyable, transforming my perspective and experience. She provided the best explanations and environment. | I took Calc 135 with Dr. T last semester and it was truly a great experience. I came into Rutgers with an AP score of 2 from Calc BC and was afraid that I would do just as bad in this class, but Dr. T was super clear and easy to follow during her lectures and I ended up doing great in the class. I highly recommend taking one of her classes. | Dr. T was very clear in her lectures and made sure we understood the material and was engaging. One of the best plans she tells students is to write down steps on how to approach problems. This was useful especially when coming to word heavy problems like related rates and optimization. Her lectures are definitely worth going to! | I had Dr. Tabanli in Spring of 2023 for Calc135. Starting the course, I was very intimidated but she guided the entire class really well. For all topics, she plotted out a structured approach for us to be able to handle any problem; it was not what I was used to with previous math teachers. Very understanding and always willing to help you out. | Dr. T gives many helpful materials and she is very caring, attentive to answering students' questions, you will feel motivated, encourages student to speak up in class and is really happy for our success. She encourage us to cheer up and tell us a lot of stories and insights in the early morning and suggested we attend the section later in the day. | Calc 135 is a difficult course and some professors at Rutgers can make the experience worse. I felt Dr. T was overall a great professor and prepared us very well for what the exams were going to be like. This was my first time taking calculus and I was able to get an A with Dr. T's teaching. Use both Dr. T's and Dr. G's websites to review for exams | Calc 135 is not easy if you haven't done it in high school. I worked really hard for B (goal was an A) and I studied for hours just to barley get a B on the exams. Her office hours are great and she was very helpful. She's the best teacher I've ever had. She saw the hard work I put in and acknowledged it. If you don't know precalc..yikes good luck | I like how the lecture notes are posted to canvas after this way I can review it. I also like how open the professor is to questions to clarify if we need any help. I also like that she uses a tablet and shared in on the big screen so I can follow along step by step without being confused. | She was not the worst however there are better professors for calc 135. She only goes through a couple of problems out of the 80 minutes in class. She likes to spend time telling us what we should do to increase our scores or her personal experiences as a professor. I don't like her teaching style (doing problems quickly and then waiting for ?'s) | Do not take Sheila Tabanli. She spends much of her lectures patronizing the class on what they should be doing outside of class and spends little time working on the actual problems. Her quizzes are graded very harshly. If you do not use her methods, you will get points off. This means whatever different methods you learned in highschool is useless | I took the class with Dr. T in the spring, I liked how she tries to understand the concept from the student's point of view and encourages us to ask her questions. | Had professor Tabanli for the summer and she is by far one of the worst professors I've had at Rutgers. Her lectures are very boring, and she is super strict and late when it comes to grading material. I ended up withdrawing and loosing a lot of money. Would never recommend her. | I took her class during summer break and she is not understanding. She is horrible at grading!! I would never want to have a professor like her again. | Dr. T was a wonderful math teacher! She was very thorough with her explanations for solving problems and helped tremendously with reinforcing learning. You could definitely tell she cared for her students. I would recommend taking her for this class! | Dr. T is a very caring and accessible professor. She works through problems in class, and pushes you to ask questions during and outside of class. She made the course very enjoyable and talks about study habits, and improving yourself. She can be a bit slow reviewing the material, however it does help to learn the material thoroughly. | Dr. Tabanli really cares about her students and Math125 with her was so much fun! She empowers students to succeed in math and gives engaging lectures with videos and there are light group dicussion about math stratgeies for success (that translates to other classess too). The class is not difficult at all and helped me get an A in Calculus 135!!! | Dr. T is a good professor, however, be prepared to study on your own. She spend the first several minutes talking about affective study methods which I did found to be helpful. Do go to her office hours because she really does care about her students and wants to get to know them better. | During the class, I have learned many advanced theories and skills. All those theories have laid a solid foundation for my future academic and professional aspirations. One of the best professor I have ever had during college, 5 star recomanded. | Dr. T was a very sweet teacher, but some lectures were hard to follow along to. She goes fast and her notes sometimes hard to understand. The homework was also really difficult. Take advantage of her extra help sessions. She LOVES the people who come there and is always eager to help them. I would recommend her but be prepared to study on your own. | Dr. T is the best! She genuinely cares about your understanding and learning. She gave mini talks about good studying based on her research. She had MANY solved examples and exam guides to help you get ready. Solid prof!! | Dr. T was an okay professor, but the way she taught calculus was beyond me. If I had not taken AP Calculus in high school, I would not have survived in calc 135. The class is so hard for no reason and the way teachers teach it is ridiculously long. However, she is a good teacher and genuinely cares about teaching math to a group of students. | Tabanli has a heavy accent that makes it harder to understand during lectures. Lots of homework but those definitely helps you understand the concepts. Hard to communicate with her. Definitely recommend taking Dr. G because he makes the test and taught straight to the concept. | Dr. T is good prof. Calc in general is HARD. Lots algebra required. Many students drop after 1st midterm. DNR to emails, but is available during office hours. Recitation quiz every week, 3 midterms, and 3hr final. Long HW, but sufficient time to compete. Questionable accent, but if you can make it work, she is an okay prof. Provides many examples | I heard that calculus at Rutgers was going to be REALLY hard, compared to AP Calc. This professor is so kind and gives you inspiration and motivation at the beginning of every class. Their exam reviews rlly helped and if u just go to class and do your work, u'll be fine! :) I stressed out a lot cuz i got c's and b's but ended w/ an A so dont worry! | Taking this class has really helped me improve my study skills as well as helped me identify what type of learner I am. Dr. Tabanli is very knowledgeable in what she teaches, but never comes off as unapproachable. Each class we were able to give our own opinions on the topics discussed, and I really enjoyed the discussion we had as a class. | One of the best professors I have ever had. Very caring, gives out amazing lectures, and was very helpful for the A grade I got. | One of the best professors I have ever had, very caring and gives amazing lectures. | Professor Tabanli was a great Calc Professor. Calculus was initially a frustrating course for me but her teaching style and enthusiasm made watching lectures and going to office hours actually enjoyable. I definitely recommend attending all of the lectures and doing the homework shortly after as the course can be difficult if you fall behind. | Professor Tabanli is truly an amazing professor. She encourages questions both in lecture and office hours, which btw help tremendously!! She slowly walks you through any problem you have doubts on with a big smile and positive attitude. She made lectures extremely enjoyable, as she first explained the concept and then did many practice problems. | She is a great prof who gives lots of practice. Her lectures are amazing with tons of example problems. She shares her brain research and wants you to do well. Attend the office hours, do the hw and work on the posted examples you will do fine! | She is a terrible professor she is not helpful or understanding. her notes are messy and hard to read. i never got above a 10% on any of her exams, that should say enough about her class. the calc department at rutgers is extremely flawed and they do not care about their students. | I had prof. T in my freshman year of being at Rutgers. One thing I loved about her was she was just always ready to help. I would go to her office hours and ask her questions or for advice about what I should do in the future and stuff. Amazing prof, totally recommend!! | Dr. Tabalini is very kind and organizes her work in a very understanding way. She also recommends many habits that can be incorporated to improve grades for class. | Prof. Tabanli is horrible. She talks quietly, so you have to sit in the first or second row to the front. (There aren't enough such seats for the 80+ students.) Lectures are scattered/messy, confusing, and full of mistakes. She also gets review problems wrong and blames it on the calculator!!! Stay away! | She can't teach Calc: lectures all over the place. Accent was not a problem. Lecture notes were. In an online class, you would expect that professors can write. She cannot. If you want to learn calc, I would strongly suggest you take Math 151. There is a better pool of profs. It seems that the worst of the worst are teaching Math 135 at Rutgers. | Professor Tabanli is an incredible teacher who has mastered the art of making a morning calculus lecture engaging, entertaining, and something to look forward to. While you will have to do some extra studying outside of class, Professor Tabanli provides all the necessary resources and opportunities to learn. Would recommend to anyone taking calc. | She is a very good teacher, that knows her material and is very understanding. Accessible outside class through emails or office hours. She also encourages student participation with in-class drills and explains well. | While the class itself is difficult and challenging, Professor Tabanli is always willing to help. It's evident in her lectures that she wants her students to succeed, as she stops whenever someone has a question to go over a concept. If you complete all homework, study diligently, and reach out to her/attend office hours, you will do well. | Professor Tabanli is a very sweet person. I took her class online and she would always stop and make sure to take any questions and fully go through them. Her first midterm review was helpful as it was a little similar to the actual midterm. The rest of the reviews werent similar but that could also be because I took them online. Overall 7/10 | She teaches us the basic fundamentals of Calc 1. But the exams are way different and a lot harder than What she covered. She is a nice person, but I really wish she would go over similar problems that we will have on the mid-terms. You will see questions you never seen before on class so be ready. | She has very good intentions, but she's not the best. She explains somewhat okay but if you've seen the topics before it's easy, if not, it will get a bit hard. If you participate in class she can throw in extra points for quizzes. I had her this fall 2o21 and she is good, but there's room for improvement. | She is really sweet and caring. She is willing to repeat or explain problems during lecture. She also records and posts all her lectures including pdf files of her notes. I had her fall 2021, and she had double the amount of office hours compared to other teachers, so she is really accessible. Attendance wasn't mandatory when I had her. | Dr. Tabanli was not a very clear teacher. Her lectures were all over the place for me. Class always starts off simple and by the end of it, you have absolutely no idea what happened because she tries to cover so much information in one lecture. I normally watch the videos for each lesson provided by the online textbook we use, and those help more. | Professor Tabanli was so great! Obviously, calc is hard but she made it easier to understand and gave plenty of opportunities to get extra help if needed! She really shows that she cares and she encourages you to ask questions and participate. The homework isn't bad and neither are the quizzes. I'd totally recommend her if you have to take calc!! | Calc 135 itself is a challenging course. Dr. Tabanli is very caring, sweet, and approachable outside of the classroom. She really values student's feedback and comments. Calc is content-heavy but her organization & notes help understand the material better. Active participation from the student's end is also equally important to get a good grade. | Dr. T's lectures and her teaching made calc more enjoyable and she was always helpful to answer any questions. She always had accessible office hours for midterms and put in the effort to help her students. Although it is online, she really made an engaging environment. As long as you particpate in class and recitation, you will be all set. | she's a great person and all, but such a terrible professor. i would totally have her out for a coffee, but NEVER again as my professor. this is college, and it's expected that students kinda know some things, but when i clearly demonstrated that i didnt, she didnt bother to give a deeper explanation either--even during OH. :// sorry prof"
"D'Alesandro, Anthony","If you care about being respected than this is not the professor for you. If you care about being able to retain information from class than this is NOT the professor for you. He is beyond child like and does not know how to teach. He is well educated in math but as far as being able to teach it to others, his capabilities are not there. | Show up to class! He does not do notes, is not a great emailer."
"Goldberg, Richard","Professor Lyons is both demanding and tough, but then again you shouldn't be in an honors math class at Rutgers unless you are very good at math and writing proofs. Homework is every week and it is difficult, so you can't just read examples and copy. However, the internet is very useful. Oh and his curve was VERY lenient. | Tries to explain tough concepts as easily as he can, but sometimes a bit unorganized. Very kind and helpful in office hours. Exams can be tough, but overall not a bad teacher. | Good teacher. Can get a little off track sometimes in lecture, but for the majority of the time, he's very clear. He gives a practice sheet before each exam and a lot of the problems are very similar to the actual exam itself. The majority of the final exam is the same questions from exam 1 and exam 2 but different numbers. I would recommend him | Knows his stuff. Very clear, and throws in a joke once in a while. To succeed in his class, DO ALL THE HOMEWORK ON TIME. It is not collected, but they are the same questions that end up on quizzes and exams. Final is very easy if you review both midterms and do the remaining homework+the review sheet. Do what I say and you will get at least a B. | One of the best professors I've had at Rutgers. Does his best to keep you entertained while teaching a boring subject. Exams are straight off of the review sheets, if you understand them your golden for the exams. | Spends all of class deriving equations and writing proofs, not showing good examples and teaching us what we need to know. Hard. My friends had the other professor for probability and he only gave out A's and B's. Wish i took him instead. | A very nice guy and great teacher. The class is hard because the material is hard, but he's fairly lenient, helpful and tries his best to be of help. Office hours are simply a must, regardless of if you need help, since they are fun and useful. He doesn't follow the textbook which is a little tough to deal with, but supplementary books help. | he's a good teacher. very clear and consise. A bit boring just because the material is very repeative. But the prof. is cool | great professor! his exams are mostly from his review exams. really helpful during office hours! the best professor i had at Rutgers! | This class was sooo boring. I did well in calculus II because I had prof. Shady. He was really good. Maybe I've been doing poorly because this class is in a lecture hall and not a small classroom. I'm going to see him in office hours this week. I've heard he is very helpful. So far not counting the final I have a total of 25 points...I'm ****ED :( | Lyons gives very clear, precise lectures, and fair exams; is especially helpful in office hours; however, likes to make his own deffinitions that differ from the book, which actually make more sense but sometimes make life difficult if you happen if you happen to be sick and learn only from the book. Overall, I would recommend him as a professor. | Richard is a good professor, and he really knows his material. He is willing to help, and he teaches well. He is definitely one of the better teaschers of Calculus."
"Guadagni, Joseph","This human calculator is my favorite math professor, hands down. There. I said it. Congrats, Dr. G. You get an A+ from me for your superb teaching and outstanding organization skills. And genuine care for your students' success. | I don't get the low-star reviews. Some find his seriousness off-putting, calling it rude or condescending, but they just need more maturity. Dr. G pushes students to work hard because he wants them to succeed. That's not a bad thing. Communicate with him more. If you love learning, you'll feel lucky to have him. He DOES care about your success. | Calc 135 is generally a hard course and it requires a lot of effort outside of class time, but Dr. G really helps students develop a deeper understanding of the material. He's passionate about this course and puts in the work to give students the resources they need in order to succeed in this class. I would highly recommend him as a professor. | When I was going through a really rough time personally, in the Spring Semester of 2024, Dr. G helped ensure that all my hard work in the three exams and quizzes didn't go to waste during the final. I was allowed to retake my final where I originally scored around a 20% and after sometime to deal with my personal situation retook and got a 96%!! | Dr. G is a great professor - he explains concepts clearly and is genuinely invested in student success. The course is challenging, but his teaching style and availability make it manageable. Unstuckstudy was a lifesaver for extra practice. | G was sassy, but he's organized and thorough. The expectations for the class are clear (be on top of hw, come to lecture, practice). I took AP Calc in hs and got a C, but got an A easily bc G explains calc conceptually from the ground up. He's also the course coordinator and makes the exams (take him if possible). You can do well, ppl are dramatic | Do not take him. Doesn't explain topics clearly as he expects you to have already taken calculus and grades extremely harshly. You have to do the questions in a step by step way and if you do it even slightly different, no points given. Sometimes was caring but sometimes was extremely rude. However, I cannot deny that he was good at what he does. | The entire class is available through video and in-person lectures if you aren't lazy. He's there to make you pass, so if u aren't doing well, it is on you. | Overall this is a difficult course that requires a lot of time outside class time. Dr. G makes the time to explain things and clearly teaches each topic where as other professors do not. I had to retake the course and chose Dr. G because he was the best professor out of all of them. While the class itself is difficult he is a great professor. | Literally the worst professor, rude and forgets that some students are learning calc for the first time while he's been doing it his whole career. | I took Dr.G twice for Calc 135 because I got a D the first time I took the course. I decided to take Dr.G again because he truly is the best professor I have ever had. He truly tries to make you succeed and puts in that extra time one on one if you need. Calc135 is a very difficult course but you won't regret taking it with him if you work hard! | His courses are very easy to understand and very logical. The exam content is very relevant to the review materials. The best math teacher I have ever had. | Lectures are very good, dude gives really good feedback, his class is passable if you put in the work and hours. Homework can be annoying sometimes. | Fire teacher. | Dr.G teaches math in a way where you understand why you do certain steps for a problem. He emphasizes organization in your work and common mistakes students make to make sure more students get correct answers. The study material is very organized. If you have questions abt hw, ask after class and he will explain thoroughly. Best calc prof u can get | Okay teacher, although not very good at explaining things in different ways. Very condescending when students struggle to understand his way of teaching. Explains easy topics in a lot of detail and hard topics in barely any. Cares more about the method in which you get the answer more than the actual right answer itself. Avoid if possible. | Dr. G was probably the best math teacher that I have ever had. He explains each topic carefully, answers questions effectively, and is very clear on what topics you should review before exams. Overall, he is a great teacher who made my first-semester math class a great experience. If you need to take Calc I, TAKE HIM. | One of the best professors I've had. Hard class, but showing effort goes a long way with him. He's funny & caring and makes class enjoyable. Do lots of practice before the exams and you will be fine. Ask him questions constantly and try to get in a section that he teaches for both the classes and the recitations. | one of my favorite professors ever! attending lectures and recitations alone was enough to get an a for me. he answers questions really clearly and makes sure everyone understands the concept. his lectures were really engaging, hes funny too. | I took this course in the Fall of 2022 and failed, but I retook it with Dr. G in the Spring of 2023 and passed with a B+. While he is known for his snarky comments, in reality, the guy is a truly caring professor who cares about his students' success. Besides that, he speaks clearly in lectures, is easily understood, and answers questions. | i actually love Dr.G so much. i would honestly take him for every math course if i could. hes very caring and his lectures ensure you know all the material you need to know to succeed on the exams. calc obviously isn't an easy course and people will struggle, but if you do your part and go to his lectures, you will do fine. TAKE DR. G!!!! | I would note on the mans grading but that just the mathematic department. They are just flat out annoying to deal with and if you just need calc1 for you major, save yourself the stress/$ and do it at community. He's a good prof, his resources are accessible and there should be no surprises, the no BS way of grading is the 1 reason why a C is a 55. | 10/10 Professor! He makes lectures understandable and enjoyable. Dr.G is always there to answer questions, help students, and offer many resources outside of class. You can tell he wants his students to succeed. I'm not even a math person but I do look forward to going to calc and this class has been one of my favorite classes by far. | Very straightforward in lectures, so you know what you're doing and learning. Helps people if they are having problems with math in lectures. Is a bit corny but does well. Study for the tests, he creates them so you know exactly what you're getting into. Also check out his page, it has a lot of resources that you should use. | One of the best math professors at Rutgers. His lectures were very informative as he explained everything very well. Exams can be difficult as you need to be specific with your work and answers. He helped out a lot at recitations, I highly recommend him. He is the course coordinator for Calc 135, which helps a lot. | Dr. G is an amazing and funny teacher, but you should expect to work hard for this class. This is a coordinated course (and Dr, G is the course coordinator), so all the exams are the same for each section. | Dr. G has to be one of the best teachers I've ever had. He's super knowledgeable and will put in the effort to teach you as long as you are willing to learn. He may have the occasional corny joke, but he's a great guy and I highly recommend anyone who has to take the class to have him. He's literally the guy who makes the tests, so give him a shot. | I was scared to take Calculus 135 because of how many things I had heard about the course is challenging. Coming from someone who struggled with math throughout high school, Professor Guadgani had easy-to-follow lectures and reasonable assessments and was always ready to help his students. I strongly recommend taking his class. | Dr.G is a nice teacher. He explains everything clearly. And his lecture is very clear and easy to understand. You need to spend time and make effort to success in this course. But not that hard!!!! | He is an asset to Rutgers. Dr G sets you up for success. If you put the effort, you will be fine. The kids who complain are the ones who barely study and try to cheat, but they probably found out after the first exam that the only way to pass is to study. And no, Rutgers won't get rid of the legend because some lazy bum that failed reported him. | STAY AWAY!!... I didn't get to pick a professor for calc G was assigned and it was the worst. He makes students feel bad when they participate and get something wrong in a lecture and his tests are the worst, super tough grader and focuses too much on an explanation of the answer rather than getting the answer correct and never admits to a mistake | This professor is like a father. He is such a great man to this planet. His class is very rigorous, but you know what thats how college is and it prepares you later in the future to tackle harder subjects and problems in life. I wish he taught all my classes. I learned so much in calc 135 that it's been a year and i remember all of calc 135 still. | If I could rate a 0 I would. He is an inadequate teacher but that's not even my issue. He is so entitled and judgmental. Its giving high school teacher on a power trip. He expects you to know the material before he teaches and then expects you to get all the practive questions right and when you dont he is so rude. I cannot stress how rude he is. | Dr G. made math worth going to twice a week. He did an excellent job at explaining every concept both in class and on his website. He really does care and will put in the effort for you as long as you show effort. Recitation sucks but class isn't mandatory so you don't have to go. If you have to take Calc at Rutgers, take Dr. G. | He is a good professor but when it comes to getting grades you just gotta work hard and earn them. Getting an A is pretty hard in this course. | Calc 135 is not an easy class. However, if you have to take this class, i cannot stress enough that you have to take it with Dr. G. He responds to emails quickly, he responds on the discord and explains the material to you perfectly. He never makes the class dull, just ask questions and make sure u understand the material, and do old midterms! | He is a great Professor. I am not good with math and I don't have good memorization skills, but if you work really hard, you will pass. Unless you are good at math or smart, it's hard to get an A or B+. He makes the exams so I would take his class. This semester's final Exam was hard :( | Not a fan at all. Makes things more difficult than necessary and is not polite. The tests are not in any manner fair as there is not a decent amount of time allotted per question, he really should revise that. Please don't take it with him, not a good choice, I'd try to find a more decent curriculum elsewhere. | He is the best math professor and as long as you do your work you can get an A. | Not willing to do much to satisfy the needs of students. Be prepared to either teach yourself or find someone that can teach you because professor G's lectures and 'help' will not be enough to pass | You get what you put in- if you actually try in the class then you'll pass. Attend lectures, ask questions. Honestly is kind of a tough grader but will give credit where credit is due. He really cares about his students, and can be fun, but don't come in expecting an A. | Definitely is not easy, but is one of the few teachers at Rutgers that shows up to class and actually teaches. You should take Dr. G, but be prepared to pay attention and work for hours every day. | It's understandable that we are in a pandemic and motivation is hard to find, but there's no reason for you to hate on Dr.G. He provides so many resources and opportunities for you to do well. His lectures are extremely informational, easy to follow, and he's easy to contact outside of class. This class teaches you more than math skills. | Dr G is 100% worth taking. He gets a lot of hate but honestly I love his teaching style and he explains things in a good way while making calc somewhat fun. It is a very hard class, but it really forces you to develop good study habits and apply concepts. Very accessible outside of class and cares about his students. Don't believe the rumors | Dr. G is a great professor. He explains concepts very well and his yt vids especially are helpful. The people complaining that he's a terrible professor probably did the bare minimum to aim for C. His exams are extremely hard and could look foreign if you can't grasp the concepts he teach. He can be rude and sarcastic to students which is annoying. | Please take this at a community college, save yourself from this guy's wrath, makes it too hard for no reason and is annoying. | His lecture videos on youtube are extremely helpful and probably the reason I passed this horrible course. His notes are very organized and hes definately one of the few professors who adjusted to remote learning well and easily. Solves many problems to help you understand. I hated him for all the unspecified constant questions on the midterms tho | Dr. G is extremely difficult to reach out to when trying to email about something. He is very sarcastic in his emails and seems like a bully when telling his students what they can or can't do in emails. I have never in my life had a teacher that had such bland responses when trying to reach out for help. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES. | This professor is incredibly disrespectful and rude. Me and a few other students that take his Calculus class email him just for clarification on some of the things in class and his responses are just short and disrespectful. He isn't helpful at all whenever we try to reach out and he seems like he doesn't want to help his students out. | Not a good choice, he has a temper and can be very annoying at times. Really picky with the class in terms of grades and just doesn't give enough time for the average student to complete tests. Not a fan. | Calc 135 is horrific, but if you want to pass you 100% should take Dr.G otherwise you'll just be wasting your time. He's the only one who knows what's on the exam therefore even if you do not have him as a professor you will end up watching his lecture videos anyway, so save yourself the time/energy and just take him for calc. | Dr. G was really funny and definitely stressed putting your own work in. He's a great teacher but expects you to understand and do the rest on your own, which is understandable. Go to office hours and make sure you're watching the videos on Youtube and using the WS on his website for exams, make yourself formula sheets, etc. Watch lectures!!!!! | Possibly one of the worst classes I've ever taken. He constantly gets mad at every email interaction, and redirects you to your professor (who redirects you to him again). We had a midterm every two weeks, with no opportunity for extra credit. I took AP Calc BC in high school and this class was wayyyyy worse. Avoid at ALL COSTS. | Terrible professor. The transition with online classes was terrible as the tests changed in format every two weeks, and we never knew what to expect. He would take 3-4 days to reply to emails only to say that we had to contact our TA, or the TA would say that we had to contact him. The entire class was such a mess, take it at CC if you can. | As the course coordinator who made all of the tests everyone hated on him saying the test were too hard and bothered him with emails. In reality he posted more than enough lectures and notes for kids in all sections view and took away proctor track. Additionally he made the cutoffs more than fair for the final grades so if you didnt pass then idk | Dr. G is the GOAT. Great teacher. Always makes time available for students. He explains the concepts in an easy manner for students to understand. Midterms are different from the HW questions but if you really know the basics (unlike myself), then it's not that difficult. He even lowered the cutoffs for everyone. Best part about him is his sarcasm. | Big G was a great professor and explained concepts in a VERY sophisticated manner which made it easier to grasp, and this is coming from someone who hasn't taken calc in the past. Very organized with all notes online, and he is always active on the math discord if you need him outside of class. ALSO HAS YT VIDEOS!! Fun guy, but be ready to work. | Top choice. Dr.G is your best bet here, he answers your questions in class, DOES MANY EXAMPLES which is so essential and beneficial, and he has a sense of humor. He actually TEACHES which is so helpful to students during this pandemic. His tests are pretty hard, but its college so get used to it, at least he prepares his students for the exam. | Tries to relate to students, and exceeds expectations. WAP is his favorite song. This class is hard, the people who are complaining didn't go to class. | Dr. G is seriously the man. Don't believe any of this slander on RMP. His lectures are extremely informative and he prepares you so well for tests. One of the smartest people I know but also just a great guy. Has office hours all the time and expects a lot, but if you work hard and actually take the time to learn, you'll do great. BEST CALC PROF!!! | Amazing professor, would definitely recommend for Calc 135. Very thorough and explains everything well. | Dr.G's lectures are very good and he makes sure everyone understands the material and offers a lot of extra help. He knows what he is talking about and also his sense of humor is great. The class is hard but he prepares you fairly well for the exams. | Professor Guadagni is literally one of a kind. Even online, he manages to teach his students well! I understand everything he teaches clearly. He even posts enough review sheets and hw for everyone to understand the material. He's super funny and is always cracking jokes. Turn your camera on, and there's a good chance he'll choose you to answer a q | Dr. G is a great professor who puts in so much effort for his students. As someone who is not that great in math, I studied by doing the worksheets and past exams that he gave us, and by going to class, I was able to grasp the concepts as well. I recommend him for calc if you are willing to put the effort! | Possibly one of THE worst professors here at Rutgers. Absolutely terrible at communicating with the class, gets annoyed at every little email, and gives exams that are COMPLETELY different than the content taught in lectures/MyLabs. | Dr. G is the most compassionate & effective professor I've had in a long time. He expects a lot out of his students & this really forces us to fully understand the material. His exams are difficult but also reflect the information learned in class. You can pass with a modicum of effort & you can definitely get an A if you work at it. -Gisciple | The calc final this summer was extremely difficult. I studied so hard and even though it was open notes, I could barely get by the entire exam. Class was open notes yet seemed harder than I thought it would be. Officially hate math now. You cant even avoid him because he creates the final, so even if you dont have him, the final screws you over. | Difficult to understand his teaching style. Extremely sarcastic and practically bullies his students. | Dr. G test are very hard. His exams are the hardest probably out of all the professors. He is very good at teaching but his exams are 3 times harder than a normal professor. I dont think its worth it their are a lot of other professors who actually teach but have fair to easy exams. AVOID at all cost. EXAMS HARD REQUIRES Extra effort. Go Reddit!! | Dr. G is insane . His tests are difficult - the transition to online was even worse since he made the exams EXTRA HARD. On top of that - he purposely tried to catch students cheating. His notes are accessible though but I would never retake calc with Dr.G. Not a good experience. Rip."
"Ning, Harold","The most dry lectures I have ever had to take within the statistics department. He puts the entire class to sleep, and then gets upset when the midterm average is low. Avoid him. | Lectures drag on. Personally, I wish the class was taught at a faster pace. He follows the textbook for the most part. He assigns a few homework problems here and there that aren't graded. If you know how to do the homework problems, you'll do fine on the exam. Doesn't take off points for computational errors. | Class goes quick and he doesn't explain, just shows you how to do a problem and moves on. When studying for exams I can't understand how to apply the notes to other problems. Bad textbook, you cant teach yourself anything. just don't take stat 379. Attendance isn't mandatory but nothing is posted online. the grade is 3 exams so no room to mess up. | I have not taken his course but we was extremely rude to me when I emailed him. | Class examples and homeworks are easy - pretty different from exams which are difficult. i saw no improvement to my grade with handed in homework. all-in-all it's easy to pass, but i don't think he curves | ridiculously easy..his exams are pretty much the exams he does in class..so if u attend class and take good notes(which he lets u use for the tests) guaranteed to do good..there is that one question that asks u to go a lil further than what u did in class but other than that...easiest class...=]] | Hands down the most boring teacher I've ever had in my life.What's even worse is that there are only 4-5 questions on his tests,and there is always one that is near impossible.Test questions are nothing like the homework he assigns,they are much more difficult.Reminds me of Ben Stein.He does let you use notes during tests,but they never help at all | This guy sucked! It's probably that dirty green mug that made him a horrible professor. Thanks for screwing up my grade. | pretty easy class, but this jewish guy is boring as hell. 1 question on exam always seems to be unfair, and homeowrk doesnt count for anything, but overall an easy course if u pay attention. hes always carrying a dirty green cup full of water | What a nice little ""Jewish Granfatherlike"" man, Great teacher. Exams are very fair | EASY EASY EASY EASY EASY - very nice teacher.. Class def easier than theater apps. Probably easiest class on campus. Go to class and take like 1 page of notes - then squeez everything on to 2 pages of note for the exam/final. And wat do u know... an A... | sacrowitz is an ok professor...but it's better to just read the book, & you understand more that way. Homework obviously doesn't influence your grade in borderline cases like he says, and his exams are ok, but there's always one question that's unfair. | Good Prof, Exams are simple, open-notebook, and open-textbook (including the final), explains things very well, pay attention and you'll get an A. | easy easy easy... easier than theater apps by 10"
"Threlfall, Shawn","Great dude, very fair. Lectures can get a little long but overall not a difficult class. | He's a super chill professor. Very caring. Lectures are a bit long, but you are allowed to take breaks."
"Grier, Toby","Professor Grier was a very nice and funny professor; it's clear that she wants people to do well and is very accessible in office hours. Calculus is a very tough class and lectures will go very fast, so it will be hard to keep up; the class is curved to make up for this, though.. A 55 was a C. | She was definitely a caring and kind professor who would answer any question you have. May be the best bet for Calc135 as she explains topics very well. The class moves very fast, but that is expected since you meet twice a week and there are many topics to cover. The textbook is a waste of money, never used it. | V sweet prof. Open to answering students' questions; she'll always say, ""That's good, I'm very glad you asked that."" Gives many examples in class, includes hard examples from previous exams. Goes a bit fast but that's not her fault, it's how the class is. Still need to put in a lot effort on you own in order to do well bc calc in general is hard. | She was the most cutest professor ever. She really cares about her students and helps whatever way possible. Going to lecture with a notebook would be very helpful since her lectures are filled with examples similar to the ones on the exam. Just review her lecture problems and understand what you're doing and you'll be good for the exam. | IF I COULD TAKE EVERY CLASS WITH TOBY I COULD. Cutest little old lady ever. She makes funny jokes now& then & she really cares about you getting a good grade. The only thing I recommend is to look at the textbook for the final because she doesn't make the final so it's a little harder. I ended with a B because I didn't really study. | One of the better professors for calc. She cares about the students and makes funny remarks now and then. TA was very good too- D'allesandro. I came in already with highschool calc under my belt. Put in the effort and you will do well, try to do as many homework problems if you can. 2 exams, 1 final, and quizzes each week. | I wish I went to lecture instead of sleeping in, or even did the hw and I would have definitely done well. The times I did show up to class she was good at lecturing and very nice if you had questions. All I can actually say is, put at least some decent effort into calc and you'll do fine. I could recognize her test were easy, I just didnt prepare. | Calc is hard but she really does try to give as many examples as she can during lectures so definitely go. 2 exams are based literally off questions she gives in lecture. Her exams are easier than the final (which matters so much more) so you think you are more prepared than she is. She's the sweetest woman and really wants u to succeed. | Grier is one of the best Calculus teachers at Rutgers. She does move a bit fast but that's only because the course itself is rushed. Do the assigned textbook problems and you'll have no problem passing. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class or go to her office hours, she's always willing to help! She wants her students to pass. | Grier provides excellent notes that she writes down on the board and encourages questions, but she does move quickly so make sure to pay attention. Also, do the assigned HW problems!! They help so much for actually understanding the material and doing well on the recitation quizzes as well as exams. The problems on the Webassigns are poor practice | Grier is good, she teaches well ( a little old fashioned imo but it's fine and easy to follow), and her exams aren't too bad. Calculus is a hard class in general, but she doesn't make it more difficult. She's sweet so ask a lot of questions if you have and just do the homework and try to do well on quizzes and low exam scores won't bring you down. | Professor Grier is a nice lady so don't feel so nervous. The course itself is tough but she makes it easy. Copy what she writes on the board and/or listen to every explanation she gives (they are worth it). She usually stops her lecture if students have any questions. Sometimes she can be funny so be mindful of that. Great professor overall! | Professor Grier is a very smart and adorable old lady. She's someone who only wishes the best for her students. She was always very well-prepared with lecture notes and thoroughly explained everything. I skipped a couple of classes and I was completely fine because I took calculus in high school but I know some people who struggled. | Definitely one of the better Calc professors at RU. Her lectures are pretty straight forward, she will work out problems and solutions that are similar to homework and test problems. I would recommend going to lectures unless you have a solid grip of Calc. Do not take an 8:40 class with her because it is kinda boring. But overall, she's solid. | She's one of the better Calc professors, after hearing about some of the other ones from my friends. She takes time to go over a lot of problems in class. She teaches to the test, which is good if you want to do well in her class, but not so great if you want to take upper level Calc classes. | I had her for Calc 1 and found that she was a very helpful professor. She took the time to go over more difficult problems and would go over similar problems to the test during lecture. She is very approachable and encourages students to come to office hours. I recommend going to lecture and asking questions. | She is a little fast during lecture but the class isn't bad. Go to lecture, do the homework, and pay attention during recitation. | Teaches for the test. If you want an easy A, take her over the summer. In this case you know in advance what is on the test. If you actually want to learn Calculus - look for another professor. I got an A after getting a D in the Fall semester, and I haven't learnt a new thing. | Very easy over the summer, her exams come straight from the examples done in class. | Took it during summer. It was extremely easy. Exams had nothing surprising. She only used examples from notes. Didnt use the text book after the exam. She tells you exactly what you need to know. Final is curved | One of the best professors I had at Rutgers. She is very helpful and patient with people. Very generous grader. Her in class examples are a great reference. Definitely recommend taking her! | the worst professor I've ever had, all she does is do problem right out of the book and put them on the chalkboard during lectures. if you got her for calc, good luck | Go to class! You won't even need to read the textbook as long as you pay attention to what she is doing. Exams were easy, so were the quizzes given in recitation. She is a very helpful professor. I definitely recommend taking her! | She is an awesome professor! She is willing to help everyone. Her exams are really easy as well as the quizzes from her TA! Definitely recommend taking her for Calc! | Overall, the class was very easy and straight-forward. The exams were exactly what was taught in lecture and resembled the practice problems that were discussed in recitation. Such an easy class!! I slept through the lectures and still got an A before the curve | Got a B+ with her. Very nice and helpful if you need the extra boost. Goes through material really quickly but makes up for it in office hours. Her TAs help a lot as well. Her midterms can be a bit hard if you don't study but they prepare you really well for the final. | Shes a really nice lady, her exams are a bit difficult considering she puts problems from recent finals on her tests. Curve usually depends on your class. Overall, shes a good teacher and is always available to help. | Presents material clearly, but moves quickly between topics. My biggest complaint with her is that she teaches to the final exam and not for comprehension. She doesn't give you much time to process the material or practice in class. I would only recommend taking her class if you have some experience with calculus already. | Very nice lady. Her midterms vary in difficulty. She moves fast between concepts but if you pay attention you should be able to keep up. If you miss class go to office hours and pay attention during recitation or else you'll be pulling all-nighters before the midterms | She was a very sweet woman but not my favorite teacher. She tends to move pretty fast which I thought would be okay since Math was my strong suit but I found myself very lost at times. There are recitations with quizzes every week, but the TA clears a lot up before you take them!"
"Parmar, Davanjit",Prof. Parmar is the greatest prof He deff loves to work with you Recommend to take his class
"Hafizi, Fatemeh","She is literally the most unorganized professor ever. Does not have anything thought out, her presentation ""notes"" are extremely messy and unfinished, she does not have a solid syllabus for you to know assignment due dates, HW is not helpful, she will post class announcements at midnight or later and over breaks. DO NOT TAKE HER. | An absolute joke. She explains one or two questions per section before moving onto the next one, then the quizzes she gives are almost always based on things she doesn't explain in class. You HAVE to teach yourself the material otherwise youll fail. If possible DO NOT TAKE HER, a 10pm class is 110% worth it if it means not having her as your prof. | Learned more from YouTube and khan academy than her class. Also seems to hate when students don't understand something. Quizzes are about 3 questions long and don't even cover all material we've learned. Don't take this professor. | Don't bother taking a class with this professor. Often times she showed up to class late and did her work wrong. She would claim students weren't paying attention when they didn't understand something as well which created an awful class environment for students. AND participate or else she will call on you. Should've dropped the course first week. | Should've known to drop the class on the first day when she was bragging about her fail rates. Don't take this professor. | Dont bother | Im so tweaked. This prof promised free quiz points to those who showed up to class then lied. | Im astonished how someone could be so horrible at teaching. It genuinely gives me a headache trying to understand her words. Especially when she makes so many mistakes during her lessons. | Actually ridiculous making kids stay for a lecture where quiz points were promised for helping students. Then lying last second ruining peoples chances to go home for the break. | wasn't very clear in lectures, made simple problems quite confusing and made you feel embarrassed to ask a question she thought had a clear answer, hard to understand, would always get questions wrong in class as her students needed to correct her, I REPEAT DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR, the only good thing is that this course doesn't count for credit | Honestly the most frustrating class I could take. The only class I have a grade below a B in. The teaching is horrendous on top of it being sloppy. The teacher doesn't cater to any of the student's needs. Decides to assign homework right after midterms. What a complete joke. | Makes mistakes during lessons, she would do math wrong, copied problem wrong, etc. Explains things in an overly complicated way that it's confusing. Quizzes are only like 3 questions even though they're supposed to cover several sections, each question is worth 10-15 points, sometimes she won't give partial credit. | She got confused with her work and often mixed up numbers. She was very mean to students when they had questions, making everything much harder than needed. She was also extremely unprofessional, constantly came to classes late, and did not prepare us well for the final or midterms. Avoid taking her at all costs. | She makes mistakes when teaching lessons, and does not double check her own work. Her teaching in class made me not confident in her grading my test and quizzes. She went by lessons very quickly. She was nice though and did offer a couple office hours for help. | To preface, I suck at math. Like I am really bad at it (I am gifted in other ways). I had to take this remedial math class to get my math up to standard. She was actually pretty helpful when I reached out for help. She is a bit goofy- she mixes up some numbers when doing problems on the board. If you just speak up and tell her she will fix it. | Since the Calc135 curriculum has changed, she does have a little trouble adjusting to it because she does go over the old methods and sometimes gets mixed up with the methods used. Not a terrible teacher though. Does go over the concepts we learned in lecture pretty well. | She explains things well, I did not find any issues with her accent. Always reliable to help you out with any difficulties you may have. | The class itself was really easy because i took it in highschool. But wrote alot of formula and explain in such way that it felt like english class. I had to self teach on her notes . Her accent is also difficult. Thank god she a recitation teacher not ACTUAL lecturer who was bowles | I thought I would deal with her, but she is actually the worst. She has one office hour a week. She does not explain problems well at all. | She is always available during office hours, so go if you have questions. Always attend recitation or else you probably won't be able to take the quiz after class. Sometimes she explains things quickly, but make sure to stop her and ask questions if you need it. | She seems to hate teaching and answering questions. Gets annoyed when someone asks a question and forces her to do what she's paid to do: teach. I learned more on Khan Academy and youtube than being taught by her. don't take her. | Literally the worst professor ever. She does not come prepared to class, barely even has office hours. She makes mistakes when writing notes on the board and does not know how to teach. She is very hard to understand and does not know what she is doing. Do not even try taking this class even if you have a good TA, it is not worth it | She is very rude and will blame you for not doing well in the class. She loves to criticize the class for ""not working hard enough"" and ""not paying attention in class"" when her lectures hardly make sense. If she makes a mistake in class and nobody says anything then she gets mad at students for not pointing it out. I only passed by self-teaching. | SHE IS TERRIBLE! She gets so confused by her own work and doesn't go over the concepts well! if you want to do good in calc, take it with a different TA!!!! I thought it would be fine to take her but there are recitation quizzes after every class and you won't do well on them if you take her! | Do NOT take a class with her. Extremely confusing - students often had to correct her and she kept confusing herself. Had to teach myself 100%."
"Sargsyan, Grigor","Takes points off for stupid things, such as not writing in a straight line or writing 'solution' below a question. He did not follow the curriculum and instead taught his own topics. There were no textbooks to refer too and he did not respond to any emails, making it hard to even grasp the concepts. Very confusing and does not listen to students. | Very inaccessible outside of class. Says emails are the worst way to get in contact with him, but gives no alternative way to contact him. Every email or question I've had has gone unanswered. Grading very tough, takes points off for stupid things like not being neat or not formatting like he prefers, even though he doesn't teach how you should. | It's pretty clear that he's not here to teach. He is very knowledgeable about the subject, but he struggles to present it in an easy to understand manner. I usually follow his work at the beginning of a problem and then I'm completely lost at the end. Every exam has proof problems and he is quite a harsh grader. Take someone else. | He'll work with you if you need to pass, but other than that, he's a hard teacher. Do all the work and stay engaged(not for lin alg, just generally with this dude). | Math 300 was really not that bad | Do NOT take math logic with this professor. He talks about whatever he likes during lectures and assumes you have a FULL understanding of a lot of mathematical theory. The only prereq for this class is 300, but you will NOT be prepared if this is all you've taken. He grades on a whim and exams are brutal. And I'm a math major. | Easiest professor for calc 3. Do all the homework by yourself and you'll get an A. His exams consist of problems from the recommended hw. Everything thing is from the book. | Abysmal grader. Sometimes, I'll write down pure BS on a hw and get 100%. Sometimes, I'll write out well-reasoned answers but maybe based on a slightly flawed understanding of the material, and I'll get a zero on the assignment with absolutely NO feedback on what was wrong. Never goes over the HW or posts solutions. Very reluctant to help you. | I have not so far enjoyed this class. I thought it would be more interesting, but the professor constantly goes off on random tangents which are not on the exam. He speaks very softly and does not close the classroom door. I guess he's an ok grader, but I'm overall not pleased and would simply recommend taking another class."
"Cooney, Bernadette","I had Prof Cooney as the assistant professor and she was the one that really taught. The main professor could not teach. She took enormous time out of her day to make meetings with my group when we asked, gave us a lot of feed back, was super nice and genuinely cared if you knew the material or not. Her teaching was not the best but amazing prof. | She is very helpful and gives good feedback. Whenevery you need her, she'll be ready to help | maybe she is a nice person, idk, but her teaching and her grading is just abysmal."
"Charnley, Matthew","Best calc prof in the school. His grading system gives you ample opportunity to increase your grade, and reinforces learning in the process. | Explained material in ways that made it clear & easy to understand, readily answered questions & truly cares about his students. Grading scheme is a bit confusing at first but definitely makes sense as the semester goes on & allows for second chances at quizzes that you wouldn't have with a normal grading scheme. Amazing professor, 100% recommend. | Very good professor, who genuinely wants you to succeed. However, the grading system leaves a lot to be desired. This section was the section that barely received a curve on the exams, while the rest of the sections received large curves. I would say avoid for that reason. | *Perfect*🗣️ | Would go through the topics on class and would be so respectful and caring and answer everyone's questions with equal enthusiasm and understanding for submitting assignments. Many times I missed the deadline to submit homework and he would let it slide without repercussions every time. | His grading scheme is very hard to comprehend at the beginning of the semester, but you understand it a bit more as the semester goes on. Do all your MATLAB and daily activities cause they can cause your grade to bump down to a B or C. Office Hours are also great, so go if you can. Don't wait till the last minute to do everything! 100% recommend.4 | READ THE SYLLABUS for Differential Equations. Make sure you complete enough non-core quiz objectives ahead of time so you are not catching up on completing them towards the final few weeks either through the E4 (extra online quiz) or E5 (portfolio). Also, make sure you study for the non-core objectives as those are significantly harder. | Gives great lectures, answers all questions, and explains the content very clearly. I didn't do as well because I barely put in the effort, but as long as you put in the effort you'll do good, at the end of the day it's Calculus so.. If you aren't keeping up with the class then the recitation quizzes will be hard, but the workshops aren't too bad. | Dr. Charnley is an example of a great professor and person. He genuinely cares for his students' understanding of calculus, invites all questions, and spends time with students generously. Take his courses. | Professor Charnley unlike most of the other calc 151 professors ACTUALLY makes sure that his students understand what is going on, and stops for any questions. I switched from another professor to Charnley and the difference was certainly noticable and I don't have any regrets. However, make sure you keep up with the work he assigns you. | Took him for DiffEQs. The grading scheme is difficult to understand in the beginning but it actually helps you in the end. You get multiple chances to attempt questions throughout the semester, exam questions are EXACTLY like quiz questions, so you have a really good idea of what you're gonna get on the exam. First calc class that I wasn't anxious. | Charnley is a great (and the best) Diff Eq professor. The best way to prepare for his class is to do practice problems of old exams and if you're not a slacker you'll get an A. You will get as much as you put in. Please take him and laugh at your friends who took any other prof. | Grading system is set up to help students. Great person, great professor, and always will try to help you succeed. He's my first choice if I had to take another math class and he was teaching it. | Great professor. He explained the concepts very well, and his exams were very straightforward. | He explains everything really well, goes at a good pace, and is really understanding of any situation you're in. He has office hours 3 times a week, online and in person, and he's open to answering any questions you may have. Overall he's an amazing professor, if you need to take calc, I highly recommend taking it with him. | Grading system was initially confusing, but was set up to help students. Charnley also made changes to the mastery-based grading system closer to the final to help students out, was very organized and had a lot of material in canvas, was also available often outside of class for questions and was really helpful. Overall, really nice guy. | Really cares about students, we didn't have to pay for homework program or textbook. You can make up exams and you can ask for help outside class. He records lecture and gives zoom link for lecture. Matlabs are annoying but they're cool. | 1. take calc 2 at a community college if possible 2. if you need to take it here, take it with this guy. he explains concepts really well, has good in-class examples. speaks really fast and mumbles sometimes but its not horrible. cares about his students doing well. tests are hard but its calc 2 at rutgers so theyre gonna be hard regardless. | He's a good professor. He wants his students to succeed and is great in lecture. I love his energy. If you attend and understand the material, while asking questions/going to office hours, you'll be good. Yes the tests are difficult but they do reflect what you learn in class. You just have to study and know the material. | He is the best to take Calc 4 (diff. equation) with in Rutgers. He is trying to help everyone. | There are some ratings said professor Charnley has weird grading policy, I want to say that if you read syllabus carefully, you will get it. Also, professor will explain it several times before every exam. His lecture is pretty straightforward, if you get the basic concept and central idea, you will get the exam. Take him if you can. | Great professor who actually cares about his subject and his students. Teaches in a very clear way and is ways accessible and open to questions and feedback. Tests are reasonable and exactly what you studied for, and homework is very doable. Wish I could have had him for every calc class at Rutgers. | Professor Charnley is a great professor to have as he offers a lot of practice material through worksheets and recommended HW problems, and the MATLABs are also not very difficult to complete. The grading criteria is definitely a bit weird to understand at first, but he gives you many opportunities to improve on your grade throughout the course. | Grades the class like a 3rd grade class, each section has its own grade you can attempt a handful of times. Out of the 30 sections however, there are 14, if you don't absolutely get perfect, you get a D in the class. No partial credit. At all. Which seems kinda important for a calc class. Avoid this professor at all costs. Take a real professor. | He answers questions fast and is very helpful and kind to students. I loved him for pre-calc, the class was easy and the exams were alright. If you pay attention youll pass easily. The only problem is that he doesnt grade homework and other little assignments until the very end so you might not know what you got overall. | A lot happened this past semester leading to exam formats out of his control so youll see a lot of reviews on that, but Im 99.9% sure that was a department thing. Funny, down-to-earth guy that moves at a fast pace. Gives plenty of supplemental work. Make sure to do the outside of class work to have a shot at passing. | Matt Charnley is an amazing teacher, period. He is an awesome lecturer who finds ways to keep your attention the whole time. I took math 151 and 152 with him, and it was an amazing experience both times. The only issue with the class is certain recitation sections are very late at night, and also the homework website Sapling is very ridiculous. | Avoid this professor. He speaks in 6x speed, and he doesn't teach you at all. His exams are super difficult. You can study all you want (past hw assignments, inclass assignment, and prelecture videos) the exam will be nothing like whatever you learned in class. So I would suggest finding another prof!!! | The class itself was hard but if you pay attention and get help, it'll be much easier. | I already struggled with math and online zoom classes made it worse. He was a pretty good professor to work with, but he moves pretty fast and you had to pay very close attention in his lectures if you wanted to pass. I still think he was a good professor, just bad timing I guess | Charnley is really good; I liked him from the first lecture, and that hasn't changed since. Very honest, very down-to-earth, and very attentive to students' questions. The class itself definitely wasn't easy, but he helped quite a bit. My best advice: be SUPER attentive to the homework and to the in-class/workshop assignments. Trust me, it'll help. | I took his class spring 2020, 1/2 in person 1/2 online. His classes were engaging because he's enthusiastic, chill, and caring towards students which is motivational. His tests are hard (if too hard then he'll be a little lenient with grading) but prepare you for the department exam. His teaching is organized and clear. I recommend his office hours | The level of material presented in class doesn't coincide with the difficulty level of the final exam | Had him Summer 2020 for a fully online + asynchronous course, was expecting the worst but Prof. pleasant, well organized, and accessible. Explained material well. Negative comments here seem to be skewed bc calculus is just generally more difficult in terms of Rutgers classes + workload heavy, but thats across the department. Highly recommend! | He was VERY good at explaining and going over the material. he was very accessible during office and outside of class if you had any questions he would help guide you through them Hw was Lowkey a lot, but manageable. if you couldn't do a problem you could go to his office hrs and he would help with it. I had no calc exp before his class. | There is so much homework in his class. He will fail you in the end of the semester because of some little reason. If you don't do well in class, Congratulations! You would be treated differently till the end of the semester. | Such a bad professor. Don't take his class. He will not let you pass. | He's a decent math teacher. I've had better and had worse. He messed up on our midterm and that kind of messed up my grade, but overall, if you get him I wouldn't switch out of his class. | Considering the difficulty of the class, Charnley is by far one of the better professors for it. He does a good job explaining the material, and his exams are very fair. Only complaint is that he does not go over enough examples to problems. Notes consist of explaining in words how to solve problems, and some examples. | He is the sweetest person and will always be ready to help you out both in and outside the classroom. Will give you extensions if you need it. Really understands your struggles with hw and the crappy department. He is on your side!!! Super humble and will make you want to go to class everyday. Hands down the best professor I've had this semester. | He really cares about his students and hes good at teaching & especially go to his office hours if youre confused on anything because hes very helpful. Also, his midterms wasnt that bad. Id say hes a good professor for calc 1. | This was Prof. Charnley's first semester being a full-fledged professor for Calc 135. He's excellent at explaining the material and the way he sets up his lectures are nice so he uploads his notes to canvas. He also won T.A of the year last year. He responds quickly to emails as well and I'm overall happy that I had him | Easily the best professor and class I've had at RU. Took it over the summer. Was a breath of fresh air compared to the rest of my engineering courses. Textbook was terrible but he made the material easy by taking the time to make online videos on the whole course. Tests are reasonable. As long as you do what you focus during class, you'll do well | Awesome Calc 3 Professor. Had him over the summer, but I think he's a TA during the year. He's really easy to talk to, and very passionate about subject matter. He gives you ample review, and is always willing to help you outside of class. If you have a terrible lecturer, and Matt is the TA, take the class anyway. He makes it so much better."
"Banerjee, Banmali","He's not as bad as people say tbh. He's a nice guy who gives life lessons every lecture. His teaching is just OK. Could be better, could be worse. The thing with 135 is you have to put in the work outside of lecture and teach yourself, no matter how good ur prof might be. He answers questions really well. You can tell he wants students to do well. | He loved to lecture us about life and grades in almost every lecture. He is actually a good teacher and answered questions in detail in lectures. The exams were graded really harshly but that was mostly because of the TA. If you can tolerate his preaching, this isn't a bad math class. It does become really hard to keep up if you miss class though. | Not the most entertaining lecturer & has a fairly strong accent, but he covers all the material that shows up on the exams. If you have any questions/concerns/conflicts, Dr. Banerjee is very understanding. He's a really wholesome guy and sometimes shares cute inspirational quotes in class. A bit of a harsh grader on tests but gives partial credit. | I had to do most of the learning on my own. It was very difficult to understand the professor. You must be able to teach yourself to do well. If you're not strong in math then I would not take math at Rutgers. | Such a caring professor...opened each class with an inspiring quote. He really cares for his students. | Disorganized. He runs through the lectures so quickly and will make us form groups to help each other. Wasting our time in class, before teaching the lessons. I understand math is a difficult subject to understand. But my whole class was struggling and forming study groups. But he still was unclear of what he was teaching us. | Overall in terms of his personality he is a nice guy but as a professor it was very difficult to keep up with him. He went to quickly during the lectures and sometimes he would solve problems on the board without explaining it. We asked him if he could give us worksheets or test reviews but he would say that the online textbook provided that. | It shows that he cares about his students. I think he dropped the lowest 3 homework grades and 3 quiz grades. He wanted you to do well on the midterm and final. The quizzes during class was easy as well so pay attention and write down every problem you go over. He also tells you what questions would be important for the exams! | Great personality and will explain any question you may find in the textbook or from homeworks. Sometimes he may not explain so clearly the first time, but students are encouraged to ask questions. | Difficult to understand sometimes, writes on a chalkboard, made calculus difficult by speaking quickly, very good prof in terms of personality, just wish he slowed down. I was good at all math up to calc, struggled due to prof. | I wish I could do better on my part. Banerjee was an okay lecturer and I respect that but I felt like the class could have been easier if I put more effort into it. Always hints what questions will be on the exam so pay attention. | He seemed like a sweet man but he didn't explain problems well and didn't provide good support. I was so disheartened by his class and his teaching and was so lost take any other professor he is not a good teacher | I love Banerjee. He starts his class with an inspirational anecdote and is just so sweet. But he's just okay at teaching. In general, Calc135 is hard, regardless of ur prof. However, Banerjees super generous about hw extensions, and he dropped ur 3 lowest quiz grades and 5 lowest hw grades (whereas most profs dropped only 2 quizzes). | Professor B uses mostly practice problems and is very open to questions while teaching. He has various office hours making him very accessible outside of the classroom. His Tests are definitely difficult, and the grading is very meticulous. However, he does prepare you for them through workshop and quizzes. My advice is do the MyLab carefully. | Dr. Banerjee is a great person who cares about his students. If you have taken Calculus before, he's great for Math 151. However, the course is fast-paced and requires you to work a lot outside of class, so it might be hard for those who haven't taken Calculus. He focuses on problem-solving during lectures. If you skip a day, you will fall behind. | I just took Banerjee for math 151 and I'm reading the reviews saying he's good but I disagree. For 151 he was not the best. Especially at the beginning where he made the midterm extremely hard on stuff he barley went over. Workshops were the best and quizzes were not doable if they were online they were very hard. | He is one of the few professors, especially in the math department, who actually cares about his students. He is encouraging to understand the material. Sometimes I wish he went over concepts more instead of just practice problems. He wants you to succeed and pass the class. | Such a sweet man. Prof Banerjee is so enthusiastic and kind and truly cares about the success of his students. Make sure to put in a lot of time outside of doing just the homework if you want to succeed, but that goes for any Rutgers math class tbh. Go to office hours and ask a lot of questions, I probs could've gotten a much better grade if I did. | Banerjee was easily one of the best professors I've ever had. He goes through all steps during his lectures and always is happy to answer any questions. I previously never liked math as a subject, but he made it manageable and I really enjoyed his enthusiasm when teaching. | I loved this man so much. Honestly one of the best math professors I've ever had. He was the sweetest prof and really cared about his students. I genuinely loved coming to class and he made things easier to understand. He also always answered students questions clearly and never ignored a question when it was asked. 10/10 loved prof Benerjee | Prof Banerjee is very sweet, he always starts lectures with a simple little story or motivational line of sorts. He teaches by doing a lot of practice problems, and he provides good step-by-step notes on how to solve them. His attitude helps keep you engaged. Probably the only class I enjoyed going to. Textbook is not mandatory but helps. | Prof Banerjee is the cutest old man ever. He writes affirmations on the board every day and is so sweet. I love watching him teach. He goes pretty quickly so pay attention but the class itself is hard which is why he needs to. I just like him cuz he's such a cutie and answers all questions you have. | Banerjee is nice, caring, and a good man. I wish I used his office hours more because he would've been so helpful when he sits down with you specifically to help. He goes fast in class but if you have a question (and ask pls) he will 100% answer and not patronize you like other teachers. Go to recitation! Also if you don't like him, just use Dr G. | The professor is the kindest and very understanding of any difficulties. If you aren't confident in math, i highly do not recommend calc 135 for life and social sci. Especially as a freshman, i expected to learn just at a faster pace, but the tests were NOTHING like the content you learned. No matter how much i studied i failed tests. | Very difficult class... and I took calculus in high school. Professor is very caring, but speeds through the material. If you haven' t taken calculus before, Organic Chem Tutor on YT will be your best friend. Biggest Takeaway: Use the old exams to review!! The homework and quizzes are NOTHING like the exams. Exams also tend to be abstract. | Banerjees lectures were the most confusing thing ever. I was in constant fear of not passing and I did everything humanly possible for this class. I went to office hours, did all of Dr. Gs stuff, recitations, hw, etc. None of it helped and I wouldnt fully blame it on the prof, but the class itself. His lectures were no help though. | Really really sweet guy, but he will not prepare you for midterms or the final. The only reason I got an A was because I strictly used only Dr. G's lectures and worksheets to study. Dr. Banerjee is decent, but using his notes and lecture content alone will not be enough to do good. May as well go with Dr. G as a prof or at least use his notes/WS | He is a nice professor with good intentions. He speaks very monotone and can be a bit boring. The HW was simple enough and manageable. Attendance was optional except for recitation. Exam scores were around 50s for the average since the exams were never like the work we did in class and very hard, but he offered DOLs as extra credit (mini quizzes) | He was a decent teacher, he teaches kind of fast, but he is a good professor and actually cares about his students. If you listen in class, do the hw, and actually try then you should pass this class with at least a C+. | Look he's a good guy but I just dropped my first ever class and I'm getting set back immensely from it. The grade was all based on the mylab tests that are extremely difficult and the lectures/practices DO NOT prepare you for it. The tests aren't made by him so it may not be his fault. But he didn't prepare us :( the mean for exam was 48 NOT CURVED | I honestly like Prof Banerjee because he is extremely nice and encouraging. However, his online class was structured very poorly (mostly due to the impossible mylab exams). His lectures are messy and hard to follow, so I recommend using youtube. He is very sweet though! | Professor Banerjee is so sweet! He actually cares about his students and will arrange one on one office hours to help you. He explains the content very clearly and holds multiple review sessions for students. Very helpful and definitely recommend | Dr. Banerjee is a very caring and nice Professor. Definitely recommend him! | Dr. Banerjee is a wonderful Professor. He was so nice and caring. He also teaches in an understandable manner and always has review sessions. He is just an amazing person in general and definitely hope future students take calculus with him! | Professor Banerjee is a great professor! He is very well structured and teaches in that way. He is always ready for questions and will do everything in his power to make sure you learn effectively and understand what is being taught. Hands down one of the best math professors at Rutgers. | This professors test is not that hard. I even get a 100 on the first test. If you study hard, it is really easy to get a high grade. | He does go very fast in lecture and the material can be difficult because he doesn't always explain, but if you ask questions or go in for help he will help you! he genuinely wants all his students to do well and is such a nice professor. Calculus is not my favorite course but he prepared us. Definitely study, do the HW and ask for help | He was a fabulout professor, he did go a bit fast and I didnt do so well in the course but it was more so a lack of studying all the material throughouly and not neccessarily him. He GENUINELY wants you to pass and he prepared the class well for exams. | He's a very nice guy, but he just throws a random problem up on the board and does it without much explanation as to why certain methods were used. This class was a remedial class, and the average on one of the exams was a 40. not one person got above a 65. he assigns homework ever class but doesn't announce when hes collecting it, its frustrating | He is very nice and has office hours everyday but lectures were hard to follow since he teaches by going over random problems from the book. | He's very nice, but his lectures were very confusing. You can pass the class just by studying old exams, lecture was kinda useless to get a good grade. Avoid if you can. | He will answer your questions and go over problems if you need help. Workshop attendance mandatory. Do webassign and the book problems. There are lots of formulas to memorize and no forumla sheets on exams, so try to learn how to derive them. I felt he prepared us for the exams well. | Do the WebAssign, Suggested Problems, Go to class, he goes fast but if you want to keep up you can. a great person, answer questions very well. | Banerjee is awesome and helpful. He moves kinda fast so if you haven't taken calc before it might be hard, but the textbook is very helpful. If you have taken calc, this is the easiest class ever. | The Gandhi of calculus | Banerjee is a great professor! He really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Lectures are him doing a BUNCH of different kinds of problems, and he explains himself often. Beware, he teaches a bit fast, but he is willing to see you during office hours. He also gives the chance of extra credit called ""DOL."" I recommend him!"
"Goonetilleke, Lasantha","Very unorganized, grades extremely slowly, can not understand lectures, and is very unhelpful in general. | He was a good professor. Explained the topics very well, but handwriting can sometimes be sloppy. The homework can be tedious and requires a lot of work, but it is doable. The exams were fair: open-ended was easy, but MCQ can be tricky. Fortunately, he gets the MCQ from the textbook and previous midterms. Pay attention in class, and you'll do well. | He is a good person but not a good professor. To pass this course all you need to do is do all suggestions questions and write your homework and quiz carefully. If you don't do that, you will never get pass. | Great professor that explains everything well. Could tell he cares about his students and will make time for you especially in office hours. Does grade a little slow but his exams are all very straight forward and are fairly easy as long as you do the review. Most people shouldn't have trouble with this class. I had a tough schedule and I was fine | He's an extremely kind and caring dude with EXTREMELY straight forward open ended portions for exams. The multiple-choice gets tricky, but studying the slides he uploads provides sufficient practice. Extremely accessible in office hours and understanding of external circumstances. Only flaw is slow grading due to terrible TA's. | insanely slow grader so youll never know how youre doing, has unnecessarily hard multiple choice questions, goes through material way faster than the other professors, can barely understand him during lecture, his handwriting is almost unreadable, and never even posted the solutions final exam guide. but hey hes a nice guy. take any other prof. | We didn't get our midterm grade until after we took the next one. Didn't have most grades when we took the final. Had to beg for answers to exam guides. Never responds to emails. TA just forwards email to Professor who doesn't respond. Super disorganized. | Easily one of the most disorganized + confusing professors I've ever had. Does not explain content concisely or clearly, slides are copy pasted from the textbook + not easily understandable for someone new to the material (many unfixed formatting errors too). Class frequently corrects his mistakes. Takes month+ for grades. Extremely lazy professor. | Really easy class. His lectures were pretty helpful but if you don't wanna show up you can just self-learn the material. You learn basically no theory and he'll actively avoid explaining any theory. It's a computational class and the final is basically all computations and remembering specific things. | I loved Professor Goonetilleke. He was just amazing, he taught Linear Algebra in a way that was very easy to understand. Whenever I had extenuating circumstances that came about because of life, work, or whatever, he was always understanding, and almost always granted me extensions. Possibly the nicest Professor at Rutgers. | Posting this review before any grades have been assigned. This professor is the most uninspiring teacher I have had at Rutgers. He reads straight from the textbook and makes many mistakes per lecture, often relying on students to correct his mistakes. He is unable to deliver big-picture insights. Steer clear if you are looking to learn! | He was very clear in his lectures, straightforward and was open to clarify anything to students who did not understand. Best Calculus professor that I've had. | Takes so long to answer emails, takes a month to grade midterms, hard to understand in class. Hard to want to attend his lectures when they are so monotone and uninspirational. Only plus is that the exams are mostly multiple choice. | I took him for Calc 244 and he is genuinely one of the best professors I have had so far. All of his test material is directly from lecture so I recommend going to them. He does take a while to grade the exams and the recitations quizzes can be hard but he prepares you well for them. | Lectures went over proofs and examples. His section covers a lot of material from the textbook but the final is worth 24% of your grade which is better than some other sections which have it as 35% or 40% of your grade. Attendance was taken at the most random times. | Great prof. C4 was pretty easy overall and he made his exams pretty easy too. His lectures are great but you don't NEED to go to class to do well in his class. The material for the most parts follows the slides he uploads and can be self taught thru textbooks. If u wanna do well in his class just do a couple practice problems after each day. | This is the best Linear Algebra professor you could take. He truly understands linear algebra concepts and tries his best to get you to understand them. He is a great professor and a very cool guy, although he does take a while to grade.Your final grade is mostly based on 3 midterms + final. He is also willing to work with you to improve your grade | He was the best math lecturer I've ever had; he made Lin Al interesting and fun. Test are easy, study guide prep you well. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you want a good grade it is. Quizes are hard and will bring down your grade a little. Test take months to grade. I just received my Exam 3 and Final grades yesterday | Professor Goonetilleke really did a good job explaining material. Homework and exams were fair. I enjoyed him as a professor but he took FOREVER to grade exams. Each exam took over a month to get back, and we would be taking another exam before seeing the previous one's grade. We took the final a week ago and still don't have our grades for exam 3. | Goonetilleke is a great professor. I would recommend going to lectures as he helps you understand the topics very well. His quizzes are pretty hard but his exams are fairly easy. My class had 3 midterms and 1 final. | Reads the slides, Very Hard quizzes, but has easy exams and easy class overall. Often removes the penalty of late submissions if you show some interest | Good at teaching the material and a fair grader. Study suggested homework problems and attend lecture. | Lectures were a repeat of the textbook almost word for word. Very little explanation or examples. Took very very long to grade anything. At any cost take this course with a different professor. Test difficulty varied greatly, incorrectly grading most students' tests. Good luck getting in contact with him outside of class | Matlab homework is very easy and basically free points, and lectures are organized and well taught. That being said, he takes forever to grade his exams, which is frustrating. He is also way more conceptual than other lin alg professors, so his exams and quizzes are harder. | Do not take Differential Equations with this professor. Has weekly quizzes that are averaged at the end of the semester. Has three midterms, and a final. Midterms aren't too bad if you study, final was ok. If you put the time to study outside of class the topics, you should be fine with the course. Lies about grading midterms, took a month to grade | His class can be said to be the simplest. homework depends on self-consciousness as long as you finish it daily. The first three mid-term exams were all questions after the textbook. Although final is a bit difficult, if the previous chapters have a good foundation, final will not become very bad. | Awful professor. goes faster than any other 250 section. He also gives theoretical weekly quizzes which other sections don't even have. He also posts everything late, will constantly lie about when he'll post exam grades. Super boring lectures and is terrible at explaining concepts. Highly recommend you avoid this prof. | I think that Professor Goonetilleke is a nice professor who understands the course material very well, but he is bad at explaining the concepts. Also, it's been 45/46 days since I took my second midterm and I still didn't get my grade back. Try to avoid him, because he is SO disorganized, as he posts announcements way later than expected to. | Despite, getting an A in this course I would recommend no one actually take this professor. He will post everything super later. You will have weekly quizzes that no other class will have. He will never post a single assignment on time and in general, the methods he teaches during lectures are now allowed on the exam. | He's okay at teaching but he's really disorganized. Posts our quizzes late all the time, takes a month to grade our exams (does he not have graders or something?), posts our homework late all the time. Also, his exams and quizzes asks a lot of conceptual questions that aren't really gone over in class. Don't recommend. | As someone who has always been good at math, linear algebra is harder and more conceptual. Goone does a good job at teaching it and he's always willing to explain things if you ask. If you have trouble with concepts I recommend going to office hours. Tests can be hard, they have T/F questions and a couple of proofs. Overall, good prof, hard class. | Weekly 15 min quizzes (grade is 25% for each of 2 exams, 30% for final, 10% HW, 10% quizzes). The suggested HW is long but the stuff you actually have to turn in is only like 5 problems each week. Pretty low amount of workload for a math class. Exam averages were 64, 72, and 67 (final). Syllabus says no curves but I got an 87 and they gave me an A. | Good professor but sometimes he's a bit hard to understand because of his accent and the way he talks. Exams are pretty hard. Quizzes are even rougher b/c curveballs. Not much homework, but its highly recommended you do the extra problems or you won't understand the chapters. Pretty generous curve at the end, he rounded my grade by like 3% | He is an okay professor. The homework he assigns are not too helpful for the exam. Be prepared to self-study from the textbook. | Goone's class was alright. Compared to other reviews I read in the beginning of my semester with him, I would say that they were pretty accurate. You definitely have to work and study to get an A. I had to self-apply and self-study for most of the lessons to grasp the material. His grading is pretty fair. Workload, quizzes, and exams are decent. | Professor Goon is widely known as the easy 250 Professor, but he really changed since my brother had him 5 years ago. His exams are ridiculously hard. Impossible conceptual questions. Your whole grade is exams because theres barely any hw or quizzes. Please dont take him. I worked hard and it didnt pay off, his exams are that hard. | Very old-fashioned; you read the textbook and are ""advised"" to do all the review problems, but aren't given credit for any of that work. 75% of your final grade is test-based. I was in an online section that Goonetilleke was not qualified for: he just doesn't know how to use the learning platform, and we all suffered for it. | I liked him but I found the exams to be very unfair. I would highly suggest someone else. I am not one of those students who doesnt work hard, I studied for 4-6 hours a day, and still got a C on the last exam. If you do the practice problems it will help, but save yourself the struggle and pick a better professor. | Possibly the worst lecturer I have ever had to learn from. Takes simple concepts and twists them to somehow make them more complicated. Doesn't teach off of a textbook and his slides/ notes are riddled with typos and raise more questions than they answer. Only thing good is that his exams are easy and grading is relatively chill. | My boy! A very finorminal teacher. I thought Linear Algebra was a hard course and didn't do as good but he was very helpful and caring considering we were going through a pandemic and was very nice with me alone when I went to office hours and he makes a lot of mistakes while grading exams, but overall, he has a good sense of humor and is funny. | He didnt grade our exams, an anon. grader does it. He emails back quickly. The lectures are quite dull, if you know how to do all the hw and look at your exams for your final review, youre most likely going to get a B+/A on the final (35-40%), he gave us a 2% overall final grade ec assignment. The hws are super easy (no more than an hr a week). | He's really understanding and genuinely cares about his students and whether or not they learn during his class. He is easy to reach out to and sympathizes a lot with his students so if you are unable to give a quiz or turn in homework late do not need to worry provided you have a valid reason. | Descent professor who genuinely cares about students learning as he always ensured that all questions were answered and steps/results in his examples are correct. However, too much of lecture was dedicated to going over proofs that were never necessary. He gives weekly quizzes that were sometimes tricky, however do a good job at reviewing material. | This professor deserves multiple 5 stars. Fall 2020 in his class was amazing. He gave us so much extra credit and freebies near the end of the semester. Pretty good lectures too. | I did very poorly on the first exam, but the professor met with me one on one to talk about how I could improve. He makes a TON of mistakes grading quizzes and tests so make sure you go through every question to make sure he graded accurately. he is a kind prof and wanted everyone to succeed. He gave us extra credit and was fair with his exams/hw. | Bro! You just can't say no to a 40 percent take home for final. Sometimes the weekly quizzes are annoying, but it is actually good that you are forced to re-study the old material per week. tbh, I didn't do any suggested hw, only the TF, they def help alot. | Relatively fair professor overall, but sometimes was less enthusiastic than I hoped. Do the suggested HW problems and pay attention in class and you should be ok; I shouldn't have put it off as long as I did or could have done better. Also he was sometimes very late to respond to emails. Nonetheless, not a bad choice and I'd recommend. | He is an awesome professor and his exams are pretty straight forward if you pay attention to his lectures and do suggested HW problems then you can easily get a good grade. | If you do HW and suggested textbook problems this class is an easy A. | This class was not too hard at first. Just when I thought it was manageable then it gets way harder after the second midterm and I didnt do well on the final. Because he gives no curves I dont think this is fair to give us an final thats way harder than the practice and expect us to be prepared. You really need to do all the homework problem! | Professor Goonetilleke wants you to succeed, but it's up to you to put in the work. You have to go to lectures, do the suggested homework problems, and do the exam reviews. I don't recommend trying to skip and teach from the textbook. Exams are straightforward if you pay attention, he explains concepts well, and is awesome in office hours. | He is truly the best. He is amazing at giving lectures, he gives detailed explanations, and he goes over example problems, and make sure that the students understand the material fully. Take him!! | He's the true MVP, the second exam was a blessing. S/o to everyone who took his Spring 2020 Linear Alg class. If u do all of the hw repeatedly, u'll be fine. His instructions on exams have similar instructions from the book, just in case if wording trips you up. His selected hw (that u have to submit)& the quizzes give u insight to q's on exams | I could understand concepts in easier and organized fashion through his lecture. Homework problems are optional but I would highly recommend to do those problems and review problems that he posts on the Canvas since his exams are similar to such problems. Since there is no curve in this class, make sure to try best on every exams. | Hes a tough but fair grader. Its great that he posts practice exams with answer keys so you can study before exams. If you ask questions in class hell clearly answer them but if no one asks any questions he wont repeat stuff and just move on to the next topic. | Lectures are incredibly dry (especially since it's a lot of theory as an intro course), so don't be shocked if you start drifting asleep). But he's a straightforward professor. He posts lecture slides, so review those, do the textbook problems, and Dr. Z's online practice. No curves, but he's a very fair grader. | Great Professor for DiffEq. Midterms were a little bit challenging. He made the final easy tho bc of the low exam 2 avg.. For each exam he gave us a study guide telling us what we should focus on, which helped out a lot and made studying easier. Definitely use those, Dr.Z notes, and Paul's Online math notes and your set for this class. | Good professor for DiffEq, not as easy as people make it out to be (does series/numerical methods that other profs leave out) but still doable. Gave tough midterms so made up for it by giving out an easy final. TA can make/break the class. | He's a very nice teacher, and the exams are very straightforward. He doesn't really give partial credit and doesn't curve the class, so make sure you do very well on the exams and assignments. | Overall an average Calc teacher. It is hard to understand what he rights on the board and is not very good at answering questions. Exams are tough but fair. | Las is a great professor who teaches to the textbook. His tests are fair, although you should look at examples in the textbook before tests. | Las is a clear professor, and he explains things very well. The only setback is that his class is very passive, he doesn't usually ask questions to the class. Also, if you took Calc 1 before he's a little slow, but understandably, the assumption is that you're coming to this class from Precalc. I thoroughly enjoyed him, he clearly cares. | His lectures are okay if u try your best understanding his accent. Exams are tough, way more difficult than the assignments. I hated the TA though. | Lectures are very helpful and simple to understand since he has slides. Take advantage of the online quizzes because they prepare you for the exams. As long as you attend lecture and pay attention, this class is easy. | It is so difficult to understand what he says, no offense. He explains everything in a way that is so much more complicated than it has to be. Though it may be useful for some, many of the people I know in the class struggles to grasp what is being taught. | I really liked Dr. Goonetilleke's class. It was very straight forward and an easy A. As long as you show up to class and did the homework, linear algebra is not a hard class. | This is coming from a math major. He goes extremely fast in the lecture! He does give you study guides before the exam, which is somewhat similar to the actual exam and when he explains the concepts, its extremely confusing how he explains it. And do not take Matlab with him because he doesn't accurately clarify what he wants . | No extra credit or curve in this class. Very straightforward, the class before his exams, he holds a review day. Go to those, and it is the same as the exams. He is extremely straightforward and his exams are very fair. I think he is the easiest 250 prof, so take him! Just do the hw, and follow his slides, and you can get a B or an A. No Curve!!!!! | There is no curve in this class. He is very straightforward and his HW and lectures are basically the exams. Do the HW, don't let the material add up. It's really not that hard. Use Dr.Z's Lin Alg Notes to do well, it's harder than his exams. Goonetilleke is considered one of the easier teachers. Take him! You will do well if you put in some work. | He's a great teacher makes everything very doable. He only gives assignments that will improve your performance on exams and is very straightforward."
"Hendricks, Kristen","Really, really smart person. It seems kind of hard for her to dumb things down for students asking questions, but she takes as much time as necessary to explain things and gives detailed lectures with lots of examples. Exams are easy if you attend and study from lectures, and do the homework."
"Bradley, Kristen","2 exams and a final all open note. Weekly hw can be done multiple times to get a 100. Honestly should've gotten an A cause the class was pretty easy, just make sure you know the material on the slides. Pretty exam heavy though, so if u mess up one exam its hard to come back by more than a couple pts. Overall solid prof. | boring, bad class and recitations are mandatory for no reason | shes amazing. i took her for intro to socio and socio of the family. if you participate, she loves it. she's super nice. i definitely recommend her. made an awesome friend through her sociology of the family class and i still hang out with them now two semesters later :) | Her teaching style was amazing, her lectures were very informative and very engaging. | Nice woman, easy class. Sooo boring. Stopped going to lectures because I was bored. all notes posted online. Tests open note but surprisingly kind of difficult, should have still studied before. Needed to buy textbook and quiz app for $45. TAs super nice but recitation was soooo boring too. Would take again | Weekly homeworks that take only 20ish minutes and repeatable for a 100. Recitation work that is easy even with bad group members. Lectures are as engaging as possible in a large lecture hall. Tests are open note, but you honestly just need to look over the slides before tests and pay attention in class. Passionate and knowledgeable professor. | Super great and welcoming personality! Tests can be a little tricky but the TAs are great if you need help and they as well as professor Springer always respond to emails quickly and with a lot of knowlede. There are also study guides and open notes. The extra assingments besides the tests are great to boost up your grade since they are very easy! | Professor Springer is awesome!! Her class is light yet I have learned so much from it. Recitations are okay, a little awkward but the classwork is light if you know what you are talking about. | Lectures were clear and very interesting. She's open to feedback and is passionate about what she teaches. She assigns weekly “quizzes” which you can take over and over until you get a 100. Attendance is somewhat mandatory since she'll take attendance randomly but if you have canvas notifs on, you'll be fine. | Great professor that knows a lot on the topic of sociology. Recitations once a week weren't too bad since you get to work in groups and isn't graded too hard. 3 open note exams and gives a review which has most of what is on the exams. Weekly quizzes that allow you to do them until you reach 100% Lectures aren't boring and makes class interesting. | Mandatory recitation once a week, weekly InQuizitive assignments but the answers are online, and 3 exams. Take her if you want an easy sociology class. Only downside was that I had her during an election year and she was very biased in her political teachings and views. Overall, a pretty solid class. | I took her for intro to soc. She gives a lot of time in lecture for discussion and engagement. She is very understanding towards social issues and her students going thru things. Online quizzes every week, and all the midterms and finals were open notes. Super easy class. | Professor Springer overall has good intentions but fails to project them. Her attendance rule is ridiculous and only being able to have one absence with proof is absurd. Her exams are online and open note which is great and she tries to prepare you for your exams. She can come off as rude sometimes as well. Everything is weighed heavy!!!! | She's cool but her exams were kind of difficult despite being open notes and etc. Other than that, she's pretty chill but her lectures were boring sometimes. Mandatory recitation also sucked. Homework was done on Inquizitive and you can take them as many times to get 100%. I recommend but just be prepared to study in advanced. | The participation grade for this professor's class depended on what your group members wanted to give you. You could receive 3/10 for participation if other group members did not want you to get a good grade. | This is one of the few lecture-format classes I actually found interesting and engaging. Kristen is obviously very passionate about her field and her students. She loves answering questions and is easy to talk to. I will say there is a LOT of homework, but it's easy to get an A or B as your final grade. | Mandatory recitations were by far the worst part of this class (and the most detrimental to my grade). I never felt like I learned anything from them, so it was just a waste of time to do busy work for unknown reasons. Otherwise, the class was pretty easy/straightforward. | Professor Springer is extremely kind. The tests were harder than described here but she provides opportunities to increase your grade. | This class was overall easy however the exams were often a bit difficult despite being able to use the Internet and our notes. There are also random attendance checks so beware of that. Overall the class was pretty chill! | interesting and easy class to take! there are weekly quizzes due that you can retake until you get a 100, recitation every week, and she would sometimes take attendance randomly. posts the powerpoint and the TAs are very helpful. overall great class! | If you have to take intro to sociology, take it with Professor Springer. She is very caring and is open to her students' suggestions. There are weekly online, take-home quizzes that you can retake as many times as you need to get 100. All of the exams were online and open notes/open internet. | The easiest class I have ever taken at Rutgers. The exams were literally ""open-Internet"". Even if you decide to learn the traditional way, the material is extremely easy to learn with the way Dr. Springer lectures. She keeps it interesting and actually builds a drive to learn in her students. Also, recitation while mandatory, was very interesting! | Shes AMAZING.. One of the best professors I've had at Rutgers. Her powerpoints are concise. She doesn't make you memorize a whole bunch of terms and her lectures are conceptually very interesting. She is very smart!! Open notes exams and her quizzes are fairly easy to pass too. Very nice in her email responses too. | Professor Springer cares a lot about her students and that they do well. Lectures are helpful, there are a lot of examples she gives that are on the exams and make the concepts more clear. Random attendance is done 5 times throughout the semester, exams were online/open notes (have to take in person), and there are inquizitives often. I recommend! | Had this class asynchronous. The professor was pretty good. The lectures were interesting. The content was easy. Exams were easy. The assignments were very easy. However, one gripe is that we were assigned to watch 1-hour lectures (sometimes more) in addition to reading a chapter from the textbook every week, which I found a little bit much. | Class itself was pretty easy, we had inquisitive quizzes that were time consuming, but you always get a 100. Recitation was mandatory, but it was enjoyable and fun to go to. I learnt a lot from Professor Springers lectures and I would take her again in a heartbeat! | Professor Springer is the best professor you will ever have. Her TA's are also very caring. I took the class asynchronously with in-person recitation. We have weekly quizzes that can be taken as many times as it takes you to get 100., and about two 30 minute lectures each week. This is an easy A class as long as you hand in all assignments on time. | Easiest class of the semester. Quizzes can be taken till you get 100, weekly recitation assignments that are hard to not get 100% on, Springer is great and understanding. You won't regret this class. | I took asynchronous. Quizzes require textbook use. Recitation assignments are MANDATORY! Youre allowed to miss 1 recitation assignment & 2 lectures I believe but I personally think doing EVERYTHING prepares you best for exams. Exams mostly based on lecture and a few textbook things but Professor gives you a review sheet. I loved this class! | Honestly, she's one of the sweetest professors I've had at Rutgers. She's super flexible and actually cares about her students. She's incredibly approachable and super knowledgeable about the concepts. The coursework isn't difficult at all and getting it all done is very possible. 10/10 would take again! | Prof. Springer is a great person - she has a very charismatic personality and really cares about her students. She assigns a lot of readings but they're usually pretty interesting so you can push through it. She doesn't hand out A's on papers though so you definitely have to put in the work for it. Great professor though - would recommend! | If ur wondering who to take for Intro Soc 101, I promise Springer is the way to go. She even emphasizes how lenient and easy going she is. All you have to do is go to lecture and do the recitations which are super easy. Got a 97 on the first exam and will probably end up with a A+ this sem. Minimal effort but super interesting class! | This class uses a digital textbook with built-in assignments every week. Attendance was only taken a few times randomly in lecture, but attendance is mandatory at recitation. The tests were primarily from the lectures or from the textbook. | Took her online class during the fall 2020 semester and it was an easy A. Each week, there were some videos to watch along with a recitation activity. The exams weren't that easy but if you do well on everything all the other assignments you can still get an A in the class. | I never personally talked to Dr. Springer, but I could tell that she made an effort to make herself accessible to students both inside and outside of class. She is very, very organized and ensures all the info needed for class is at your fingertips. Probably the best prof in the sociology department. | There's a lot of small things to do for this class. Lectures every week (15%), recitation activities every week (20%), one midterm (15%) , final exam (15%), easy quizzes (that you can keep doing until you get a 100) (20%), easy 2 paragraph assignment (5%) & easy group project (10%). All busy, but very very easy work. Easy A class. | I highly recommend her interdisciplinary seminar on medicine and transgender youth. It's a really informative class and Springer is great at teaching the material. Not too hard to get an A -- there were two weekly memos, one short paper, and a final paper/presentation at the end of the class. However, you are expected to attend the discussions. | Pretty good professor. She's really easy-going and the class is such a breeze. | very good teacher, explains material very well, easy A but you also learn a lot | She is an easy teacher and you don't have to attend classes to get a good grade in the class. There a 2 midterms and one final none of the exams are cumulative. I crammed all the exams the day before and still managed to do well in the classes. The class is and easy A however, you still need to do all the work required to achieve the A. | Could've skipped some classes but didnt cause i was genuinely interested. It was a very easy class. Discussion were brief, but good questions arose. 2 Midterms and a Final that is not cumulative, and I crammed the day before (got 3 A's.) Prof was very knowledgeable, but some people might think she's pushing an agenda (esp. with gender section) ez A | except stupid auto-graded essay, can't get <95 on anything. studied <1 hour/exam and never Got<97. now does random attendance checks, but they're paper sign ins. recitation worst thing ever, but can skip 2 before lose points. free 100s on prompts at least w/ TA Tali, w/o reading. free 100s on quizzes, she says u can exit them & read book to ace. | Her Intro to Sociology class was the easiest course I've ever taken. However, it was so easy that it was almost boring. I'd highly recommend it if you're a freshman or sophomore but if you're an upperclassman, you might find yourself bored out of your mind. She also tries to engage in class discussion which doesn't really work in big lecture halls. | Wonderful teacher. The discussions in class were great and you don't necessarily need to finish the reading to contribute. The $60 online textbook is a must. All answers to online reading quizzes are on quizlet so thats free 25% to your grade. 1 autograded essay that is also basically free 10%. Tests are fair, easy. For the tests know specifics. | Great teacher. She really makes the course material interesting. | Great. | Dr. Springer is a well respected professor. Her lectures are discussion based so she does want people to participate. The start of Spring 2018 you NEED an online textbook for the class. The online textbook is just for the chapter quizzes you need to take for the class, including a writing assignment. | She is a very interesting lecturer. Don't be fooled, she's not an easy A. I felt that lot of the stuff on the study guide doesn't relate to the exams. The recitations felt like an entire different class because it was never in line with the lectures, so they were pretty pointless. | Awesome teacher | Everyday I look forward to this class hoping for her to talk about her research that she does with her post-docs and grad students. Exams are purely about her research. Just study the notes you jotted down when she mentioned her research. Do not read the textbook. Also she is not bad to look at. | Easy, excellent, remarkable, inspirational. This class is purely research-based making freshmen get a head start on their resume. Guest lecturers are the post-docs that work in her lab. The syllabus was partly designed by her and partly designed by Aresty. Aresty also provided funds so freshmen have to opportunity to take this research-based class. | Prof. Springer Is an amazing professor. The topics covered in class are topics that are beneficial to current events and your living standards. Exams are easy if you study the study guide. She gives extra credit for attendance. I loved her course and she is understanding with grades. She curves exams if a number of the students get a ? wrong. | Springer's lectures are a hit or miss; sometimes she's interesting sometimes she is boring. I had her tuesdays and fridays and I almost skipped all of my friday classes and still got an A. She made us do group projects which I hated but that helped with my grade. Her exams are multiple choice and very easy. Easiest A I have ever earned. | She has recently stepped this class up compared to past years in that I would def not say its an easy gpa booster. Do not walk in with the mentality that it's ""intro to soc"" and not care at all because I saw *many* people surprised that they were getting Bs and B+s and losing the A. Random attendance checks which directly affects ur final grade | Professor Springer is an incredible teacher! She makes learning fun and encourages everyone's input. She loves class discussions which can make us stay on a topic for a long time but as long as we're talking sociology she doesn't mind. | Overall, she's really nice and a good professor. Gets distracted sometimes, but she gets all the necessary material covered. Available during office hours. Does take random attendance in lecture sometimes, but usually just for extra credit since recitation attendance is required. | Just go over her study guides and know every term/memorize every point. Don't even need the textbook. Sometimes questions from lectures pop up. Grade determined by tests. Easy A. | Professor Springer is overall a great professor. She makes class engaging and the material is interesting too. Attendance isn't mandatory but class is enjoyable. Read the textbook and study the powerpoints. | probably one of the few professors at rutgers who actually wants to help your GPA. She is very funny, sweet and understanding! I really enjoyed her class | This is an easy class and she bumps up grades to a certain degree. She may not answer emails all the time but you can figure out the answer to your question by asking around. I don't agree with all of the stuff she says like the gender gap but overall its a good class. Don't ask her ""stupid"" questions or she won't answer you | I liked her teaching style but this class gave me another reason to be a psych major. It was a good class and I understood everything she was saying. I may not agree with a lot of it but it was a nice and easy class. She doesn't always answer emails like you want to. She tried to make the class hard with participation lol. It's still an easy class | She's a good teacher but I didn't like the class that much. She rarely answers emails especially when it comes to your grade in the class or clarification for something when it's( apparently) on the syllabus. When she does answer emails she can be a very short at times but not always. The lectures can be boring at times. I wouldn't take again. | Didnt learn anything in this class, practically what I see on my tumblr dash everyday. Easy A but she doesnt allow computers in class. Didnt use a textbook. I took it bc i thought I could use it for the MCAT, but I should've just taken 830:308 instead PSYCHOSOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF HEALTH AND MEDICINE. | Easy A, Easy Class. Took her for sociology of the family and a perfect class to balance with Physics and Organic Chemistry. I would rent the book from Chegg the day before and return it for a full refund the next day. She gives you the study guide of which the whole test is based off of and plenty of opportunities of extra credit if needed. | Springer's course is more about learning the information than memorizing it. Tests are non-cumulative and pretty simple, and it's not too hard to get an A with a little bit of studying. Breaks for discussion a lot, which is nice. | Okay so this semester she definitely ""tried"" making the class harder. She started group work that counted as both attendance and work. The tests were absolute child's play though. I barely studied and got A's on all 3. They're only 25 questions each and you could walk into that class, never seeing any material before hand, and get a B if not an A. | I did not learn much in the class, should have taken a different sociology class. | Really enjoyed this class. Very easy to get an A as long as you do the assignments for recitation. Lectures are usually pretty interesting and deal with current issues. Class is interactive which helps to keep in less boring. She took random attendance and gave extra credit to anyone who was there that day. Would definitely take her again! | I took this because i read she was easy and i regret it. I didn't learn much because it was too easy and she just reads off the slides. You don't need to go to class to pass. Just download the slides and you should pass. Take for a GPA booster but not if you want to learn. Also the recitation sucks because they don't review what we are learning. | As others have said, her classes are an easy GPA booster but don't expect to actually learn anything. Lectures are aimed at the kindergarden level and she feeds you the test answers. Meh."
"Noone, Kevin","Sweetest professor ever. He's very caring and very detailed oriented with his lectures. | Professor Noone is a great guy, Calculus in general is a very difficult subject. If you pay attention to all the details he makes in his lectures, I assure you will do well. Make sure to always ask questions! | Take him! I failed the first 4 exams but went to all of his office hours and it paid off with a C+. Calc135 is hard in general but he tries to go through exam-like problems in class. He really cares about his students and tries to help them, but the course cordinator makes the exams, so he doesnt see them until after the fact. Take him if possible! | Professor Noone is truly one of the best at Rutgers. Calc is a tough class, to begin with, and what makes it even worse is the Course Coordinator. Professor Noone truly cares about his students and would do anything to make sure we all had a passing grade. He understands the rigors of the course and still makes class enjoyable. Such a great guy! | Sweet guy, but he did not know what was on the exams therefore the content taught in class was not enough to pass the exams which were created by Dr.G. If you want to do well in this class, then take Dr.G. Noone did try his best, but he went too fast and his handwriting was difficult to read. Also, he would not understand the student's questions. | The content and examples that Noone reviews are too easy. The tests were hard and the lectures just do not prepare you enough. Go to Dr. G. His lectures are better and representative of the exam. In the end, previous knowledge of AP calc is what got me an A. The way this calc course was run was a complete disaster though as the exams kept changing. | Compared to most calc profs, Noone is much better. He teaches at a good pace and does a lot of examples till all his students understand the concepts for the most part. Only downside is that he doesn't make the exams up and they can get extremely diffucult because the department head is a nutcase. But he gives a good guideline on how to pass | Would not recommend if taking class online. Handwriting is impossible to read and lectures are hard to follow. He also rarely responds to emails. The material he teaches in class is extremely easy compared to what is on exams. He's very kind and I'm sure he would be great if classes were in person. Take Calc 135 with Dr. G. | He's very humorous, gives HW extensions all the time and this online sem, some quizzes had infinite tries. Noone doesn't post videos so you have to go to class. But the exams are made by Dr. G so you end up having to watch his lectures anyway to pass. I wish I had taken Dr. G but Noone was a good professor. Calc at Rutgers is hard regardless. | Professor Noone was an overall great teacher. His handwriting can be hard to read from time to time, but he tries his best despite the whole remote learning. ALSO, the calc department itself was a mess this year- if you don't have prior knowledge of calc, ur at a disadvantage, which is dumb considering this is supposed to be an intro class. | His handwriting can be difficult to read sometimes. He might even be too easy in which the material you learn during lecture isnt to the same standard as the exams given by the course coordinator. Hes always on time for lectures and has office hours. I can tell hes a really sweet man who radiates grandpa-vibes, but I would recommend Dr. G. | Prof noone is the GOAT. His handwriting is a little messy, but he gives great examples and makes the materials so east to understand. He did his best in a virtual world and gave tons of resources to help his students succeed | He is a great professor, but I failed his cal 1, so ... yeah... | Amazing guy... Really funny. Exams were a little tough but the guys is a gem and you really feel like you are working for the class and the grade. Choose him if you want a rigorous but fun experience. | To be fair, he explains concepts very clear and he cares about his teaching. However, he is totally inaccessible outside of the classroom for the online classes. I sent him three emails during the first two weeks of class and he respond to none of them. It's a shame that I have to withdraw because of this inconvenient communication. | He is a great professor, really does care about student learning! Very understanding and clear. Shows you how to write out problems properly for exam credit. You have to put in effort but definitely worth it. Learned so much | Calc 135 is known for being one of the hardest pre-req classes and it definitely lives up to that standard. The class requires a lot of practice and professor Noone is the best possible teacher that will be there along the way to help you and is just a good guy in general! | Best professor for Calc 135. He really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. He's so smart and really knows what he's doing. Go to every lecture. | the problem with calc 135 was not noone, it was the class in general. he makes sure you understand and cares for his students. the tests were just very difficult but he didn't create them so makes sense as to why it was difficult. very good professor tho | Mr. Noone , one of the best professors at Rutgers University. If you are taking calc 135 or actually any calc class with him, in general, u will pass. He cares heavily about his students and will always keep things engaging and hilarious. I also thought it was funny when the first day of class he said ""I see you all have seen My RMP Page"" Funny asl | Professor Noone is definitely good choice. He is so nice person. He makes the class easier and funny. | He's a great professor, makes calculus a lot easier especially if you have him with Blair Siedler for recitation. | He is really nice. His lectures are fun and easy to learn, and he will make sure if everyone understand what he says. | I took calc in high school so most of this was a review for me, however, his lectures were sometimes fun to go to since he adds his own stories as well. I did skip a lot of the lectures though and was still able to catch up due to the sapling homework which was given. His midterms were clear and he was a fair grader. | Im not good at math but he made Calc extremely simple and easy to understand. Go to his lectures because he explains everything and it'll make more sense. The homework is a good way to make sure you understand what you learn in lecture. He goes off topics sometimes and tells stories, but he cares if the students understand or not. | Noone is the best professor for Math 135. He makes his lectures super interesting and he often goes into some history lessons. He's also always willing to answer any questions that you have and explains them thoroughly. On the first day of class he said ""Have you guys seen my RateMyProfessors score? That should tell you a lot about me"" What a guy. | He's so good at teaching. I actually understood all the concepts. | For this class being an advanced beginner class, he understands to try to simplify the material to make it accessible to leave out over-technicalities. He is a very humble guy and tells a lot of stories about his life and his admiration for math prodigies. His grading is tough but it may be a byproduct of the course. Very caring and funny. | i enjoyed his lectures. even though attendance wasnt mandatory, still go to them. he explains things clearly and makes his lectures funny. definitely go to his office hours if u need help. he also assigns homework online which explains how to do the problems step by step. if u really study u could pull in a good grade. | Great professor! very knows his stuff but may make some mistakes and refer to his notes at times. We really cares to make sure students understand their material and how to solve problems. He also shows how to formally solve problems for full points. He may ramble some times but keeps lectures interesting | Amazing calc professor, he actually makes sense and is clear about his steps unlike banerjee or other calc teachers | He made Calc 2 a really enjoyable class for what it is. He often told random stories during lecture and was a very clear and organized lecturer. He was very nice and attentive during office hours, but they're a little crowded sometimes. He definitely cares for his students and wants the best for them. | SUCH A FUNNY GUY! He gives random history lessons in the middle of class and it's quite interesting and often has to do with death. He had pretty bad handwriting so it's hard to read sometimes but overall is a good professor. He tells you the types of examples on the exam but you actually have to study. Do the homework problems and you'll be fine | Loved his self-deprecating stories about Ireland | I have never loved a professor more than him. The course is obviously hard so you have to do all the suggested textbook problems and stuff but basically if you follow EVERYTHING he says you will pass the class/final. Go to office hours!! and he's super nice and cute i love him and also his midterms are from the textbook problems so practice those | I attended every lecture and sat in the first row. The professor noticed this and told me he was rooting for me. The professor genuinely cares about his students and holds review sessions even though he's not required to. You wouldn't need to study if you attended all the lectures and reviews. | Very helpful in office hours, and cares if you do. Teaches very thoroughly, while telling fun stories every once and a while to keep the lectures interesting. | One of the best professors for 152. His exams are not the easiest, but they are not hard as either. He prepared us so well for the final exam that was written by a notorious coordinator. He is also very funny, tells engaging stories when the course material begins to get dry. Definitely recommended. | Calc 2 with Professor Noone was great. He was funny and would do his best to keep the class interested by telling stories either before or during class, but he was still able to teach the material effectively. He truly loves math and you can tell by the way he gets excited to teach certain topics. He is truly a great professor for calc 2. | Professor Noone is a great professor. He is even a better person. If you are struggling, GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!!! He is very helpful and truly wants his students to succeed. I would definitely recommend him. | His class is really fun to learn in. I'd take him again. | Although my class was at 8:10 in the morning, professor Noone is sometimes funny. He also explains well and speaks clearly. I would recommend him for calculus 135. | Very great professor and funny guy, made things so simple to understand, but he moves at warp speed so if you haven't taken calc before the class will be difficult. Class is hard if you don't go to lecture, he makes it really clear how he wants you to answer questions on exams, so it's beneficial to go. Just pay attention in class and you'll be ok. | He is a good professor for calculus 135. He makes a 8:10 class fun. However, calculus as a subject is generally boring. | Noone is a funny guy, but expects you to know a lot of Calc 1 already. A lot of students who had not taken Calc 1 previously struggle. Most people also fail his exams which he tells everyone, but don't let that deter you from studying his examples and going in for extra help. He doesn't write the final anymore which is unfair. Good luck. | He tends to demonstrates stuffs by doing lots of examples on the lecture. This teaching style is helpful or not depends on you. For some the examples could be useful and others may think his lectures lack explanations on theories. Overall a good prof for Calc1. | Noone is overall a nice and really funny professor.. however the example problems he does in class are not very reflective as to the questions that appear on his exams. however the questions on his exams are wayy easier than other professors'.. but he is a TOUGH grader to balance it out (takes off 5 points for each simple arithmetic error) | This was by far the hardest class I ever took, the class is very test heavy and the TA is a tough grader. I was so scared I would fail, but Professor Noone really helped me. I went and talked to him, and realized he does really care for his students, if you show effort. All my friends failed, but I was able to pass with a C. God bless this man. | Noone is the man for calc at RU cuz he is super hilarious. Took both Calc 1 and Calc 2 with him. Calc 2 is way harder than Calc 1 but his exams are fair. | Noone's method of teaching is drilling you with examples, he doesn't explain very well he kind of just points back to the example and says the same thing again. Aside from that he's honestly a funny teacher who makes the lecture enjoyable and has some interesting stories to say the least. This class is not easy so make sure you study a lot! | Noone is a great prof. his lectures are filled a little bit of history and jokes to go along with the calc; This really makes the 1hr20m lecture easy to sit through. Make sure you study hard for this class, it is not easy by any means. Exam 2 is a big step from exam 1 and the final is very tough, so just make sure you're prepared, DO NOT slack! | Prof Noone is nice and may be good for lower level calcs, but for calc 3 he's not a good fit. He doesn't really explain the intuition behind solving the problems and just starts doing examples. Most of the people doing well are people taking the class a second time or are engineers that are already familiar with the material from other classes. | Professor Noone is a nice professor, he cares about students. His lectures are full of example which make the concept more easy to understand. Also, his exams are quite straightforward. just go to the lecture and understand his examples. It is an easy A. | Took Professor Noone's Calc 135 class my first semester at Rutgers. It was a mistake in my case b/c calc is quite demanding if you haven't taken it already in high school. Professor Noone recognizes it is hard (once told the class that a C+ is a good grade in calc) yet his exam score averages were in the 45%-60% range. | On the easier side than others. He isnt very flexible and cannot work with you if you need extra explanation. | Great prof. Solid lecture with many practice problems similar to the ones on the test. I took him for 136 after I had him for 135. I rarely went to class and still did well on the exams and final. | Doesn't teach you the material. Only does examples. | The class is curved across all sections, not just Noone's. His exams aren't bad but he doesn't explain theory much. | He makes his exams harder than most professors because he claims it will make the classes curve higher but thats false. If you've never taken calc its ridiculously hard to follow his work because he doesn't teach he just writes and expects you to follow. | Took Noone for 151. At first I didnt think he was a good professor, but I think it just took time to get used to his teaching style. His midterms were kind of tough but prepared me well for the final. He also gives good advice on what to expect and resources to use to practice for the final and his tests. Overall a solid professor. | Midterms were easy, but the final killed me. | Has some interesting stories. Tels you what is on the exam. If you need an easy prof for calc take him you won't regret. | All he does is story-telling. Doesn't explain the logic behind the steps, only does easy examples. | He's a funny guy. Calculus isn't exactly my strength but I'm glad I had him as my professor for Calc151. He tried to keep his lectures light, and he would appreciate a joke or two. Overall, he's not a bad professor once you get used to his teaching style. | Many people recommended him Im not that good at math so he was a little hard but if you study you'll be above avg which were high 40s & 50s. his class isn't mandatory but he gives like 10 examples per lecture which r usually from a past exam or final so you should go to class everyday. He preps u for the final which is all that matters. he's great | Tries his best to explain everything and makes sure that everyone, including those who've never taken calc before, understand what's going. The online hw may take awhile to complete, but it goes along with what the book and professor teaches. Attend lecture bc he goes over tons of examples. Exams are a bit hard, but it prepares you for the final! | Even if you already know calc, I recommend going to all of his lectures, because he'll tell you the types of questions that would be on finals. He'll say things like ""this will be on 3/5 finals"". If you put a star next to the problems he describes as difficult in your notes, it is guaranteed a similar problem will show up in your tests. | Professor Noone is a great professor. He gives enough examples in the class and he is funny. He is willing to help you if you have some questions | Noone is a great guy but not a great writer. I spent most of lecture trying to figure out what he wrote on the board, let alone understand what he wrote. Outside of class studying is a must but he's a great guy with your best intentions at heart. Go to office hours, he's much more helpful there than he is during lecture. | Professor Noone cares about his students and is willing to help those students who help themselves by reading the text, and doing the optional homework questions from the syllabus. His lectures are pretty funny, but there are some things that you have to rely to study on your own. He's open to questions in class, but many are afraid. Def take him!!"
"Soffer, Sara","A really enjoyable professor! She is super sweet and helpful. It's clear she wants you to succeed in the class. Her lecture slides are really well formatted and she structures the course in a consistent pace. Personally I thought the class was easy but if you struggle with this kind of material just show up to class and TRY and you'll be fine. | Great Professor | You need to come to lectures. She can be a little fast and her accent can be hard to understand, but you will get used to it. Especially later in the year, she will cover a lot in her lectures, so v important to jot everything down. Recitations help a lot and her exams arent hard at all as long as you know all the concepts(no stupid hard problems). | The professor has a heavy accent, but the class notes and homework are crucial for doing well. Unstuckstudy AI helped me prepare for the tough conceptual exams. | She has a heavy accent and lectures were indecipherable, but you need to go to class in order to copy down her notes- they are really helpful Her tests were a mixed bag- heavy and confusing on the conceptual T/F questions (20% of test usually) but very easy and not as in-depth as other profs on the actual problems Just depends on what ur good at | I thought Prof. Soffer was great. She cares about her students and while her lectures and notes are not the best, they are helpful to refer back to when you are reviewing on your own. Make sure you do ALL the assigned homework problems and thoroughly understand the reviews (harder than the midterms). Memorize true/false questions in the textbook. | STAY AWAY FROM HER. The worst professor I've had at Rutgers. Everyone teaches themselves with the textbook. Extremely hard final (if you fail the final you fail the class). | Very kind professor, overall did a good job teaching Linear Algebra. The midterms and final weren't anything too crazy and if you put in the time to study, you'll do great in the class. | one of my favorite professors at Rutgers. She cared so much for the students and did everything she could to help them. Her exams were not difficult as long as you understood her notes. Her notes are very helpful and planed out very well. You can see she has a passion for the class. | Professor Sara Soffer is a great professor she makes the concepts very easy to understand and prepares you well for the exams she always gives out reviews which makes the midterms and final manageable and it won't be anything you haven't seen before if you are planning on taking this class with her make sure you do the homework and youll pass! | Prof. Soffer gets the job done for Math250. I found it much easier to learn by the book than by her actual notes, and practicing the HW problems assigned. Her midterms are pretty easy and she always gives midterm reviews which are always harder than what's actually given. She cares about her students and like to story tell. | I really enjoyed taking Math 250 Linear Algebra with Professor Soffer this semester. Her notes are extremely well-annotated and easy to read. She also provides study material well in advance of exams along with video explanations for some review problems. If you show interest in the material early on, she'll definitely favor you in a curve. | Her class is as difficult as any other math class but she is always open to answering questions and helping you out. She even provides dedicated zoom meetings a day or two before the exam for extra help. Make sure to do the homework for practice because the course moves quickly and covers a decent amount of material. | Pop quizzes were annoying and exams felt tough. Professor Soffer definitely demands a real understanding of the subject and makes you work hard for your grade. However, she's understanding and she will help the class out when people are struggling. At times her class felt terrible but I think by the end, most were satisfied with the outcome. | Absolutely terrible professor, the exams are astronomically difficult and are set-up for you to fail. Lectures are inpossible to understand and you essentially have to teach Calc2 to yourself as she does a horrific job of it. | Professor Soffer seems like an intelligent woman but definitely not a great professor. She talks down on her students and has called them weak for not doing well in her course. Definitely a bully. Take any other Professor besides her- you will be miserable in her class. | Her lectures didn't do it for me as student. I had a hard time following her explanations, and her accent didn't make it much easier. That's perfectly fine but the bad thing is it felt like students like me who didn't like her teaching style and rather go from the book got punished for it. She does a lot of pop quizzes which were miserable. | Bad microphone quality. Heavy accent. Do NOT skip any class even though the lectures are a waste of time. There are pop quizzes in class. Her notes are sloppy and hard to read. You will have to put hours of time to study on your own by reading the book. | Professors microphone quality is abysmal and has a thick accent. Much of the difficulty in the class stems from trying to understand what she is saying and deciphering the scribbles on the slides. Classes are recorded but not uploaded to Canvas. Attendance quizzes. If your only option for Lin Alg is an online Soffer class, just wait a semester. | Worst experience in a online mathematics course thus far. Professor's microphone is low quality so it is hard to understand what she is saying and her teachings completely deviate from the textbook material. She talks down students for failing, and a lot of understanding is just implied and glossed over in this really abstract course (linear alg) | I would recommend any other professor. She is very condescending when you ask her for help. Not a good teacher. I spend hours on this subject and have to teach myself the material. | Nobody in class understands her awful lecture style. Everyone has to self study the material. The worst part is she gives pop quizzes in class to force students to attend because her lecture skills aren't good enough. Will make you hate any subject she teaches. | She is a great person If you care about getting an A, show her that you are willing to learn - participate. I didn't care about the grade but her exams are easier compared to other classes. But if you care, you can make it. Also, she takes care of attendance. She sees if you are the kind of person who cares about the class, and she can be favorable | The instructor has great passion for the subject and wants everyone to succeed. She does prefer some things to be specific, which may have not been a concern if the class was in person. Although her assignments are difficult, as long as you put the best effort, she'll bump you a letter grade. (I was a couple points away from a B, and she bumped me) | Took her Fall 2019. Made me love math. Made me want to major in it. Wonderful woman. Just go to lectures and really understand what she has to say | I have tried writing a review of her that has been taken down for quoting what she said to the class. Don't take her if you can. She can be nice but it's overshadowed by her general behavior. | Sara gives many chances for students to pass the class, she gives easy assignments and quizzes that should help the student's grades if they are paying attention in class. There were even assignments that gave you free points for reading directions. Sometimes she does go all over the place but she will answer any questions if needed. | Her explanations are not very good, and she does not know how to teach linear algebra correctly. She tries to teach in her own methods but ends up confusing everyone. | Professo Soffer is nothing more than a lecturer. She reads directly from the slides, and has such a monotonous voice it's really easy to get distracted in class. Would NOT recommend taking her class. | Shes okay. I feel like many times she makes it more complicated than it really is though. Took it last semester. Midterms were easy got A+ but for some reason the final felt harder where i got a C+. Quizzes each week are pretty easy BUT no partial credit which sucks. I got a 0 for not adding +C when solving integrals so be very careful | Really cares about the class and puts a ton of work into the lectures and slides to make sure she gets everything right. I love her teaching style and you will really understand linear algebra. Pretty easy tests too. | I don't get why some people like her so much. She's an enthusiastic lecturer but other than that I don't think she's good at explaining things at all. Talks very fast and does not dumb things down. I think she forgets it's our first time exposed to the material. I'm not dumb and I have a very hard time following her lectures. | Prof. Soffer is fabulous at teaching Calc II. She taught a lot of tricks in solving problems, which were extremely helpful. She did not cancel any lecture, even when she cut her finger! Although attendance was not mandatory, attending lecture was crucial to surviving Calc II. If I did not get an A in her class, I would only have myself to blame. | If you have never taken calculus before, I strongly recommend taking a different professor. She does not post her slides online, moves quickly, and has an accent people may have a hard time understanding. However, her notes are pretty decent and her exams are easier than others. Don't take your phone out during class. | Professor Soffer's teaching is often hard to understand because she goes extremely fast and doesn't post her slides online. While you're quickly copying her slides down, she briefly goes over the topic and expects students to memorize what she quickly describes. Wouldn't recommend taking Calc with her. The TA was good tho! | I took AP Calc last year, so I knew some of the material already. But Soffer's powerpoints are REALLY great, and explain everything literally step by step. Literally. She's not great at answering questions but the TA's are, and overall she does a good job of making sure we understand the concepts in class. Her tests are easier than other profs. | Sara, what can we say about Sara. She is a whole queen, and her accent just makes you wanna laugh. She's really not that bad but she is a little odd. She has a ""copyright"", meaning no phones and nothing she posts or writes can be shared or posted or she'll ""Call her lawyers on you."" Very good lectures and she has good tricks. Very enthusiastic. | Do not take Calc with Prof. Soffer if you have never taken calc before. She does not post her slides online, leaving it up to you to take good notes, as this is really the only thing you can study. Hard recitation quizzes, and limited office hours. | Teaches by powerpoints, which admittedly are good, but the issue is they arent posted online. So it ends up being worse than writing on the board and explaining everything. The tests really arent that bad. Very similar to the study guides. Homework every week and pop quizzes. Also will call someone out for so much as their phone vibrating. | Go to class, and don't use your phone. Don't be late either. To do well, write down every example she does in class and learn the super unique shortcut methods she teaches. I used to hate calc but she's a solid choice and made it much less complicated. She's a good choice for calculus. It won't necessarily be easy, but she makes it straightforward. | Professor Soffer, while at times can be a bit unclear, did a great job of teaching linear algebra. She uses PowerPoint, which is not as bad as it may seem. Tests and quizzes are straightforward and fair. As long as you attend class, take notes, and do practice problems (i.e. the homework), you will find the class easy. | Shes probably the best linear algebra professor in Rutgers. Love her lecture and her power points are really clear with all important testing points. She is also a fair and nice person that puts a lot of passion in teaching. Just put effort in the course and you will be ok. | Her lectures were the best lectures I've attended at Rutgers. She genuinely cares about the student understanding the material and it shows. Her tests and quizzes were super fair and if you just show up to class, take notes, and go over the homework I can promise you she won't disappoint. | Take detailed notes of the lectures because she doesn't put them online. Do the homework and study the concepts. PRACTICE problems for the exams, she does give partial credit. She gives her tricks to make calculus easier. if you pay attention and ask questions, you will be fine. She is not half as bad as everyone makes her seem to be. | Might be far the the best math teacher I've ever had. This is coming from someone who failed algebra in college, and now I've gotten to the point where Soffer helped me pass Calculus. Really accessible outside of class if you need extra help and her homework/practice exams/lectures will completely prepare you for the exams. Thank YOU!!!! | What a crazy lady, and I mean that in the best way possible. Amazing professor, loved the way she taught, especially having had terrible experiences with my calc teacher in high school. Her powerpoints make everything really clear and her tricks are really helpful for the midterms and final, so definitely go to class. Do all the textbook homework! | I honestly really liked her. People dont do well because they dont show up to class. But, literally everything that we write in our notes is on the exam. Also, watch the videos she posts before exams, they are the main reason I did well on them. Dont challenge her or ask questions, ask your friends instead | She is basically the director of the math department, and students in her class always get better grades than average. She's caring if you participate more, or if you just come to every class and she recognizes you. She teaches with powerpoint though, and it was different, but it's not bad. Basically, if you study you'll pass though. | Worst professor I've taken . I already knew calculus which is the only reason I did well. She is very rude, and hates phones and is always yelling at people multiple times in one lecture which is extremely disruptive. Also mostly teaches off of ppts and doesn't really do too many examples which is a necessity for math classes. | Shes very strict on the use of electronics during class, and does random attendance checks throughout the semester. Unfortunately she doesnt post her notes online so you have to show up to take notes. Her exams were extremely difficult, the only reason I passed the class was because of the final | Soffer is probably one of the worst professor I ever had. She is not willing to help any of her students, and if you do poor on her exams, she pretty much tells you that you are screwed for the class. Better off with any professor except for her! Switch out ASAP | She was probably the worst professor I've ever had for anything taken at Rutgers, I actually had to switch out of her class because of some things she said to me in front of a room full of people (and was taken to the head of the math dept.) Super hard exams, is rude, has a bad attitude and expects you to know everything in an hour and 20 minutes. | Overcomplicates simple concepts, like limit of functions, etc; turns calculus into rocket science, expects all of us to have the intellect of Albert Einstein, and requires us to follow her method only, even if we can think of another method that we're more comfortable with, and is probably more simple. | Not a nice lady. Very impatient. Exams do NOT prepare you for the final, which is the majority of your grade. | Sara Soffer takes simple concepts and turns them into rocket science. If your not good at math, definitely DO NOT take her class. She's super old school-- puts unreasonable emphasis on attendance, and confiscates phones during class. You can do well if you study, but this class isn't worth the effort. Take someone else. | She teaches math off POWERPOINT SLIDES. And you do not get access to them outside of class nor can you take pictures. Not approachable. She teaches for people with very strong base in math, not if you need help or patience. Exams very hard and recitation quizzes were a week behind so youre learning new stuff with being quizzed on last week. NO TAKE | She's a nice lady but the absolute worst professor ever. Do not take calc with her please! Her exams are disgusting, I compared my exams to my friends exams and hers are so much worse. Any calc professor is better than her I promise | Not a great teacher, not the worst. Exams are heavily off the homework she assigns in the textbook and the problems she goes over in lecture. Accent. Took AP calc already so it was easy for me and I didn't have to rely on her. If you have no calc experience or struggle with math you probably aren't going to do too well with her. | Does not properly answer questions in class. Gives attitude when asked about a problem | horrible don't even waste your time | you have to take notes as she doesnt allow to take pics of her slides. Nor does she posts them on sakai. | Learned everything from the TA, not her. Don't recommend. | Soffer is a very sweet lady but her TA's do most of the grading which makes it annoying because they do not really care. This class is very fast paced and challenging. Two midterms are pretty hard and she surprises you with random attendance checks. DO NOT SKIP. SIT IN FRONT. Her accent makes it difficult to understand sometimes | I don't like learning math off power points. It doesn't work for me. She makes lots of mistakes othewise. | She isn't interested in class and that shows. Has limited office hours. Also the final is harder than her midterms. | Sara is a great professor! I understand why some people have a problem with her class, but compared to most other math professors at Rutgers, she's amazing! To do well, make sure to review her notes and do all of the homework problems she assigns. Go to class and take notes! She has her own unique ways of solving problems, and is really helpful. | If you value your happiness, do not take SAra's flippin class. Sara does not teach what you need to know but even if she did you wouldn't be able to understand her accent but what's worse is her way of speaking which is always incorrect/confusing even on tests and emails. Attendance is graded. | She is definitely one of the better professors in the univeristy. While she does have an accent and can be strict on cellphone/device use in her class, her lectures are clear and she provides many resources for her exams and for the final exams which include video solutions (which are super helpful). Definitely recommend her. You will learn. | You have to go to class and take good notes in order to pass this class. As long as you put in effort, it wont be that difficult. | You can tell from the lectures that Professor Soffer knows what she is talking about. Her PowerPoints are very engaging and even funny at times. But if you shes you with your phone shell call you out."
"Bahri Nunziante, Diana","He cares a lot about his students and he is very easy to reach out to. His lectures are very informative, but more on the conceptual side than the problem solving side, which is i guess what recitation is for. He is very approachable and kind but the example problems he does in class are sometimes hard to follow because he makes it up on the spot | Mohamed is a very nice professor who is responsive to students and goes into incredible detail during lectures. My main criticism is he picks unnecessarily complicated example problems where he spends more time figuring out how to do them rather than teaching. As his first class, he's probably just learning what works for him. Overall great."
"O'Halloran, Roger","Lectures are pretty much mandatory, but are incredibly dull and boring. The Professor often just stops talking and leaves long breaks of silence while lecturing which makes class very hard to pay attention to and awkward. Professor also does not listen to feedback and has a very much ""I am always right"" attitude. | Very helpful office hours. His teaching is pretty dry, perhaps the course itself is boring. Generous curve. Speaks perfect English with crystal clear tone. I love how he treats every students with the upmost respect, whether failing or not. For this class, better be precise as a pinpoint for writing proofs. I warn ya! | Very smart guy. Speaks perfect English. However, he is quite difficult. Most of his lectures went over my head and had nothing to do with his tests, which were not too bad. He grades with a generous curve. Also, homework was incredibly hard. It included many proofs and derivations for only a 200 level class. | Definitely easier than 451. Not many homeworks, although they are graded tough it seems like they don't count for much. Not a very good lecturer though. Not very engaging with students, seemed bored a lot of the time. VERY generous with grades. | tests are exactly like homework problems, so as long as you can do them you will do well on the exams! he's very old school, but gives a decent curve. he is boring and confusing during lectures, though. | I'm guessing that all of those who are complaining below are simply too dense to realize that the exams are EXACTLY like the homework problems. If you're fool enough not to do the hw, then you should fail the exams. He's actually a pretty solid lecturer and a helpful, understanding guy who does his best to help the students out. | Professor Nussbaum literally only teaches the theory straight out of the book and never gives himself enough time to do a clear set of example problems. He does not review homework, and his exams are really really hard. Then when everyone does poorly he shames the entire class but doesn't wonder if the exam was maybe too hard. But nice sweaters. | He's a slow lecturer, so you'll probably understand the material pretty easily. The book itself is really good, and his exams are REALLY easy as long as you do a few hours of studying over the week before. He's a pretty friendly guy and if you attend his lectures, he will automatically like you a lot more (because so many lazy people miss class). | It was very painful and such a waste of time to sit in his lectures. Professor Nussbaum does not teach, he just reads from his old notes and it takes two lectures to prove a simple theorem. It is not because the proof is long, it is because he stares at his notes for a long time, trying to understand himself first! | Professor Nussbaum has been one of the worse teachers that I have seen in my whole life. It is not because he can not teach well, it is because he does not make effort. He should not be paid according to the effort he made on his teaching. Besides he is very mean, especially to Asian students. Maybe he has a lot of personal problems. | Awful, he has no interest in teaching. This man is the problem with tenure. Doesn't put any effort into the class. His writing (always cursive) is illegible, and usually at a 30 degree angle down the chalk board. Avoid him. And yes, he is grouchy as many others have said here. | good professor. but really hard exams. i got a D on my first one and studied ridiculously hard to pull off a B+ in the class. i was in a class full of honors students tho, so no curve for me. | Hes an awsome teacher. He def knows what hes talking about and is willing to teach it. The only drawback though is one needs to ask the right questions. hes a more appropreate proff for higher level courses. Exams are easy and lectures are hlpfull(if appreciate his precision) | Focuses a lot on proofs, but he has 10 year, which he mentioned, so he definitely knows what he's talking about. If you want to actually learn linear algebra and how to prove it, this is the class for you. If you're an engineer and are taking this for an easy A tech elective, I wouldn't recommend it. | He teaches very exactly. I had a hard time because I think in the big picture, whereas he is extremely detail-oriented. Other than that, he's extremely knowledgeable and relatively patient, especially during office hours. | This guy was the absoulte worst teacher. Your effort and time are not worth his rediculous class. F him, and it. don't ever take a course with him if u can possibly avoid it. you will learn nothing, and you will still be overwhelmd with work. | omg so bad. hes so boring and teaches useless theory. its basically a self taught class, as u have to read the book and absorb all the information urself. theres no way to check ur understanding as theres no recitation and we never go over any HW, so basically if u dont get it, ur ****ed. i went to his office hours, he was grouchy and unhelpful. | huge doushe....dont ever ever ever take him | Good professor. I had a C at most all semester and he gave me a B for the class. Very easy exams. People say he can be a grouch, I can see how he can be, but I didn't think so. | ugh! terrible. i agree with below: grouchy. made the class extremely boring. seems unwilling to help people. | Very good professor. Very helpful in class and outside of class. The exams are exact homework questions which we have already gone over. On top of that, he grades extremely generously. People said he is a grouch, I didn't think so; either way he's still a good professor. | hes just a grouch | material is boring so class is boring. he's not a bad teacher but lectured me on not really showing up to class even though attendance is not mandatory. whether or not i come is my perogative and now i think he's grading me harder because i didn't go. | Grouch"
"Krueger, August",As a person hes amazing but as a Prof terrible. He cannot teach at all. I stopped going to lectures and just taught myself the lesson from the textbook. Half the students in my class has to retake the course because they failed.
"Prevost, Shari","Prevost is the best math prof I've had so far. Most of her lectures are coherent and make complex topics easy to understand, if you do the practice sheets. Grading is not too strict, and office hours are very helpful. Calc 152 at RU is hell, I recommend taking it at a CC, but if you must take it at RU, try to get Prevost. | I'm taking Calc 152, and now I wish I had Shari Prevost for this class. Her lectures are always on slides and for each problem we go through, she makes sure she writes down every step of it and posts her work on Canvas. She is always willing to answer the question and go back to a problem if someone asks for help. She is definitely not a bad prof | If you haven't taken Calculus at all before she will fail you! The way she teaches this course is not designed to help struggling students in Calc who have not taken the course previously, since her lectures are filled with words and explanations way beyond the level of understanding of first-year Calc students. She is VERY theory-heavy & confusing | lectures are very theory heavy; does good job explaining theory. if you dont pay attention in lecture gl doing the hw; explains things with theory too much and cant simplify material. strict grader, doesnt drop any grades. Grading system is weird but that's not her fault.Only plus is that you might do better than your peers for the final | She is brilliant. She is an expert at Calc and an expert at teaching the subject. Her mental math and memory is something to be an awe about. But she is also very very tough at grading. She prepares students very well for the final exam, but her midterms, her TA, are very tough in grading. | The professor's lectures were very easy to follow and I felt that they helped me really understand the material and theory behind the problems. The homework and the workshops helped me to understand how to solve problems, so it was a nice balance. I did feel that the tests were graded a bit harsher than they should have been. | Theory-heavy lectures. The pacing of the lectures can be unbalanced. The coursework relative to what is being taught is incredibly difficult, and office hours/tutoring is going to be necessary for some. Very difficult exams and harsh grading, but it does help clean up small bad habits. Not my style of teaching, but maybe it's better for others. | Her classes were a bit a hard to follow , but the workshops were really great. She teaches more about proofs and theoretical stuff and didn't do so many examples in class (which I prefer) If you're having trouble go to office hours!!! | She is an excellent teacher if you pay attention in her lectures; At the same time, they can sometimes be monotone; she presents the materials in a digestible manner and always makes the lecture slides viewable before the class. Understanding what you're doing with the workshop and the courses and the exams is pretty tricky, so be prepared! | Her lectures were the best I've seen so far. She always goes in depth and goes slowly so the concepts are easy to understand. However, the homework and going to lecture is very important. The exams are hard but manageable. | Professor Prevost does a great job with her lectures because it's more organized and it makes it easier for the students to understand. At times, she skips over some of the steps involved in the problem as she assumes everyone knows what's going on. She is very helpful if you go to her office hours. | I really enjoyed my time with Prevost. Although the course material was extremely challenging at times, she has thorough explanations and always asks students if they have any questions or would like her to repeat anything. This class is no joke and can be really intense, but Prevost teaches it well and sometimes even makes it enjoyable. | She genuinely wants everyone to do well and puts in effort for that. Any other professor I won't have done nearly as well. I'm taking her class again this semester. | She has difficult tests but prepares you for the final. I was half a point from a B after the curve but she rounded my grade up, so she seems pretty lenient with close grades. | Prevost is a very thorough lecturer and explains concepts very well. She makes her TAs grade very toughly for quizzes and workshops but I think this prepares you for the exams. Her exams are harder than other classes in my opinion but prepare you very well for the final (which is the same for everyone). Lectures are boring but important. | She is not a good lecturer. She's one of those math professors that spends more time trying to prove a concept with theory than teaching students the concept with examples. Also, she takes off points for the smallest things on the midterms. My midterm was 100% correct, and I got a 89 because I misplaced a few equal signs and drew arrows for flow. | Professor Prevost is a great person. She's very polite and kind to all of her students. As a professor, though, her grading borderlines ridiculous. I oftentimes lost a few points per question for forgetting to put equal signs ( I just indent to show the flow of my work). Notation lost me up to 5-10% per exam. Switch if you see her on your schedule. | I didn't appreciate her until I went into calc 2 with a diff and bad prof. Prevost lectures are very detailed and thorough and shes easy to understand with no accent. Lots of people will tell you shes a bad teacher but trust me shes one of the better ones. She is a very tough grader and the workshops are tough, also read the book before class! | Prof. Prevost is an ok prof. in general but she is really harsh when it comes to grades. I wouldn't recommend taking her because there are better professors who go slower on lectures and will try to help to help you if you put in the work. Also, her workshops are usually harder than others. She is also very knowledgeable about the material. | Shari cares more about bragging how much she knows about Calculus thank actually taking time to teach the students. Her exams are ridiculously hard and even attending class will not help you pass. I recommend switching out and taking any other professor over her. Shari will insult your intellectual ability and this is incredibly unmotivational. | She's a very thorough lecturer, so I definitely wouldn't skip class (she takes attendance, but it doesn't count towards your grade). If you pay attention during lecture and are willing to work hard, you will most likely pass the final and class, which is standardized by the department, so her exams are harder, but it's better in the long run. | Firstly I'd like to say that she is a great teacher in the sense that she is clearly passionate about what she does. Other than that there isn't much else, she crams in so much information and her grading on exams is very rough, points off for very little stuff. I got a chance to see exams from other classes theirs are a joke compared to hers. | Although she may not be easy, she is a very good teacher and she explains everything thoroughly and wants to make all of her students pass. She even holds review sessions before exams, so that she can clear any doubts you may have. Use her office hours, and pay attention during class, and you will understand it. Our TA used to confuse use though. | I thoroughly enjoyed class with Dr. Prevost. She answers emails very quickly. I think she cares about her students. | Calc 135 is a tough class; Prevost doesn't make it any easier. She writes and talks very quickly during lecture, which hampers her students' ability to understand new material. If you want to pass the class, you need to do extra problems to make sure you understand the material. The exams are tough, so you need to study a lot on your own to succeed | Great lecturer, honestly one of the better ones, She gives out hard exams and kind of is a tough grader but this will help you out for the final since it is departemental | Shes one of the better part time lecturers at Rutgers for a few reasons. Namely: she speaks English, shes a mix of challenging but nothing too crazy, she gives a lot of worksheets. Shes definitely not a walk in the park, but shes also not Naumova. That being said, she can be frustratingly vague answering questions. Its only to get you thinking | She really helps students understand the material and gives amazing lectures. Beware of the quizzes each week in recitation and she sometimes grades attendance. The homework takes a while but is great practice for the exams. Exams are super easy if you studied, and the curve is really nice. You will learn a lot in this class. | Extremely difficult class. Very time consuming. Does not explain things well. Would not recommend taking her if you are not a Calc whiz. | I took all of the classes in the start but couldn't understand her even though I tool calc before and it wasn't transferred to Rutgers. She teaches too fast and never gives you opportunity to write the stuff on the board. She is also a very hard grader and you probably can never get an A in her class. | She is really smart and conveys her knowledge extremely well during lectures. She goes in depth with everything she teaches which is great if you want to know WHY the math works the way it does. She is kinda monotone and serious but cracks a few jokes every once in awhile which makes it all the more funny. Overall was a pleasure to be in her class. | Weekly quizzes. Homework (WebAssign) was time-consuming. Two midterm exams and one final weighted heavily. Averages weren't too crazily low. Writes on chalkboard, which I can appreciate having taken so few classes in the mathematics department. Started taking attendance after first midterm. I managed an A even though I took Calc II at Middlesex. | If you take her class be ready to teach yourself. She makes frequent mistakes in her work while teaching the material and doesn't explain material. Going to her office hours is a waste of time as she won't even help you if you don't know the basics (because what are office hours for right). Her exams are very hard. | The exams aren't that impossible. I reviewed for her exams by doing the calc review problems on the calc 151 website on rutgers. I believe the tests are similar to those problems. Her grading is lenient too. Also, there isn't a lot of hw if you dont procrastinate. Do them when they are posted! | Prevost is the Worst teacher ever. Her lectures make me unlearn all the calc i've learned before. Her exams are so hard that no one leaves early. she explains things and concepts in class and it just confuses us more. Do not recommend | Prevost is definitely one of the better calc professors out there; she explains everything thoroughly, goes out of her way to hold review sessions before exams, gives generous curves, and lets you correct your exam answers for extra credit. Anyone who complains about her probably just doesnt put the extra time in that calculus requires. | Even studying for days didnt help on the tests at all, the difficulty of her tests is impossible! | She does explain why things are the way they are, but man dont get me started on the exams, literally everyone failed it, the problems on the exam were nothing like the problems she does in class, there aint no review test or anything, and you cant even ignore them since they are worth 80% of the grade. | Amazing professor. Must-have lectures. She explains WHY for everything. Do the web-assign thoroughly! Her exams are straightforward, she gave us 10 points for free AND we did test corrections for more points! NO OTHER CALC 151 CLASS DOES THIS! I always struggled with math, now I have an A. Idk what the previous poster's talking about. She's awesome | Hard lectures. Shes so hard to understand with her weird tangents. She goes off topic all the time and the material is extremely difficult to understand. She cant take the time to help beginners."
"Coley, Ian","Coley is the best math professor I have ever had. He made me love math as a subject, and I thought his lectures were very useful. He makes the visual calc 3 concepts clear with his style of explaining things. His sarcastic but down to earth personality is awesome. I really wish I could've take Real Anal with him before he leaves RU. | I think Professor Coley did a great job with a course that was difficult to teach to a large number of students. Lectures can be difficult to follow, but if you are able to come into class refreshed or read up on the topic a little bit beforehand you'll be good. His office hours are amazing, and he grades for understanding. Loved his class. | Professor Coley really cares about his students. He makes difficult concepts easy to understand and he's pretty funny too! | Class should have been more organized. | Professor Coley is a great professor that truly works for the students by making himself readily accessible outside the class. However, he makes his exams a ""race with time"", as too many difficult questions are crammed into one exam. It's difficult to fully answer all the questions before time is called, so you mostly rely on partial credit. | What he says are all true, its just that the language he uses are just not used to what students have been using to learn. You can find much easier explanations of what the professor overcomplicates on youtube. Also he goes way to fast and its literally copying the notes without actually having time to digest what he overcomplicates. | I already took multivar before this class, so it was pretty easy. However, his lectures were very clear for review and helped many around me. He is also very accessible for help and is funny. | Professor Coley was a good lecturer that made a very difficult topic manageable. His exams were take home projects that was straight from the textbook. This made the class easier than usual. Nonetheless, Real Analysis is still a difficult topic that takes a lot of work. He graded firmly, but fairly. | Very nice guy and good lecturer. Responds fast to emails and is very helpful. Projects were pretty difficult as was the final exam. Really have to work for an A. | Professor Coley was one of the best Mathematics teachers I have ever had. While some may argue that he moves quickly in lectures, he taught the subject in an organized and understandable order. We took quizzes every recitation period which helped prepare me for the exams. He was very clear about what would be on the exams and offered good reviews! | Professor Coley is a good lecturer. However, he goes fast in his lectures. If you miss a lecture, you will get behind, and it will be hard to catch for a class like Calculus. Overall, he know what he is teaching, and he cares about other students."
"Song, Jian","*Had him for Math252 Song is a very fair professor. He provides practice exams that are very similar the actual exams in class. He also manages to keep very dry lecture material engaging by being a pretty funny guy. However, he is sometimes unorganized, rarely responds to emails, and isn't always great with questions. Overall, he's a safe option. | For as hard as the content in this class is, I think Prof. Song did a great job teaching the course. He breaks down solutions into steps to make things easier to understand. If you don't attend lecture, you will understand nothing. The homeworks are pretty long but they are very similar to test questions. Funny guy too | Attend lecture, if you don't you won't know the material. Song will give out extensions left and right just ask. He is very funny and definitely knows what he is doing. The material is very boring and long. Hw will take up hours and pages. My grade in the class is bad cause I do bad on hw which the TA grades. Exam is very similar to practice exam. | I don't understand why so many people are rating this professor poorly. If you show up to class and pay attention to the lecture you will pass the course. He is very clear in his lectures and answers questions effectively. The homework can drag on sometimes. There is not much room in the grading for screw ups so prepare well and you'll be alright. | Anyone who has given this man very negative reviews is delusional. He's a very smart person with fair exams. The homework assignments are long sometimes but if you work through them thoroughly you will have no issues on the exams. The materials isn't simple per-say but go to class and you'll make it out alright. He explains the topics very well. | Not great. Boring and fairly difficult but a nice curve if you do well compared to the rest of the class. | Great professor. Teaches material very well and always makes exam material very clear. If you're a good student, you will do well. | he teaches the material really well and try to joke around hes genuienly a nice guy. His tests are very similar to his practice test so nothing to complain about there. Would recommned to take him for 251. | 40-50 homework problems everyweek that will take you a good 5 hours of working but only randomly grade three out of those 50... only does worthless proofs on board | Please note: there are two professors named Jian Song at Rutgers. I had him for Numerical Analysis. Before each exam, he gives a sample exam. Familiarize yourself with the topics on the sample exam and you will do well. this is not an easy class, but he is a generous grader. I'm not sure i learned anything in this class unfortunately :( | English isn't great and course sucked. | He gives tons of homework, 10% of grade, 20-30 exercises per week that will take you a good 3 hours. He pretty much only does useless proofs in the board leaving real exercises for the homework. Tests will be 80% exercises, 20% proofs. Do the homework but don't bother to do the proofs, they are impossible. Focus on the exercises an you'll get an A. | he gives 50 problems for hw each week. his website is terrible,says he will put up hw and practice exam but doesnt so if you dont go to class you wont get hw. exams easy except for proofs. its u get it or u dont for the proofs(worth 20 pts) and it brings your grade down drastically."
"Peterson, Stephen","He was a good lecture professor. People who had problems with him either missed lectures or didn't pay attention during the lectures cuz Prof would do basic problems of a concept to teach us and it was easy to follow along. He would also give prblms from the textbook that were the EXACT same as the one's on that week's quiz. Take him with Ning. | I took Peterson for 112 and I definitely didnt see the 5.0 ratings he got. He was alright, honestly the first week Peterson was really passive aggressive and eventually mellowed out which is a first. I do appreciate that he'll take time to show steps in solving a problem. Overall I wouldnt say a bad professor but def not an engaging one. | I will likely be failing this class due to the fact that I have not taken math in YEARS. However, this is not due to Prof Peterson. Honestly a great class to be in, and he is hilarious. Very responsive to questions and passionate about what he's teaching. The class is very fast paced and I recommend taking precalc 1 and 2 instead. | mostly self taught last half of the semester, ok prof compared to Amodio for precalc 111 prefer him over Peterson, avg on quizzes were solid better than exam grades, overall a decent rating | One of the best professors at Rutgers. I had Amodio for 111 and I like them both equally. Peterson is funny, explains things well, super laid back and gives extensions, and is overall just a really great guy. 100% recommend taking him. | A really really good professor! The best I have taken at Rutgers, super accessible; had four days of office hours a week and answered any questions sent through email, as well. He's super chill, and let's you know exactly what you need to know for the exams and what you don't. Important that you go to his lectures. | He was really good at answering questions and he was able to explain things in detail, however he was extremely ill-organized. His notes were a mess. | Got a 90 on the final and passed, self learned mostly. Class is super manageable if you spend an hour or two before each quiz just studying it, I got around a 13/15 average on the quizzes. -1 or 2 points for rounding errors, simple mistakes, etc. just follow instructions. Just don't get too behind and you'll be good. YouTube will help you if lost. | Although his office hours were online, he is super approachable. He seems like he isn't, but he is, even right after class, definitely ask questions if you are confused. Attendance isn't mandatory for lectures, but it's super helpful to go. | if you just show up to every lecture you can get at least a B. He is very good at teaching but if you miss class you cant teach yourself the material. The math department sucks and their test questions are pretty specific to what you do in class. He tells you what's on the first two exams but the final is written by a different person | Great teacher. You can ask questions in class, and he will answer them and ensure you understand. He holds Zoom meetings for office hours and is pretty nice. Just don't use your phones or laptops while he's teaching...actually pay attention. | Great professor. Gives clear explanations and answers questions well. Simplifies material well. Course can seem to move quickly at times but he is always available in office hours and through email. You can expect a quick response to your emails as well. | I took him for PreCalc and he was so bad at teaching. On day one he comes in and starts writing circles on the board without an introduction. He would also belittle his PreCalc students since he thought we weren't that smart. Everything I did in this class was self-taught and half the class failed. | Professor Peterson is a great professor. I failed Pre Calc my first time taking it with another teacher, but with him i am doing a lot better. He is one of the best professors i have had and i would absolutely take him again. | I really enjoyed taking Professor Peterson for Math 112, as he was definitely very helpful and made the course much easier than how I expected it to be. I believe that he was extremely accessible and made difficult concepts much more easier to understand. Definitely take him as a professor if you can, he's extremely great and passionate about Math. | This prof was great! Was very clear about what was on exams and was extremely helped in office hours. He did go over problems a bit fast, but if you asked him to slow down or repeat steps he would. The way he taught was a bit unorganized, but he did many practice problems which made understanding the content much better. Take him if you can! | Professor Peterson is a great teacher. Not only do you get to learn about calculus but he teaches why calculus works and the behind the scenes of calculus. Takes his time with the lectures and actually cares about the students. One of the best professors I have ever had. Just make sure PLEASE DON'T NOT USE YOUR PHONE OR LAPTOP IN CLASS! | He's definitely a fair professor. His exams are straightforward and he isn't the type of prof that tries to trick you with concepts. He is a VERY lenient grader ,gives so much partial credit. His lectures are boring and he's sloppy on the board but you can get away with skipping class and self-learning proofs etc. warning: don't bring your laptop! | Peterson is one of the professors who's like the Angel at the end of the crossroad. He congratulates you on making it to Calc 4 and gives you an A to boost your journey. Srsly, this man's lectures are amazing and he pretty much tells you what's on the exam (and the questions are straight forward). Just don't use your cellphone in lecture please :) | Specific on what will be on tests | Very easy professor. Class average is 85 on the exam yet many students ask really dumb questions during class. I have no idea how the average can be that high. He follows the book closely and doesn't provide much insight into the topics. | The class is easy if you do the homework and pay attention to the lectrues. Also, he's very specific about what's going to be in the exams, so there are no suprises. | Great Professor. Really wants to help you. But if you use electronics in class, oh boy!! You will be on his bad side. Some might think that might be a deal breaker but you really dont need a laptop for a calculus class. Work hard and you will get an A. Havent seen an avg of 70 or 85 in a Calc 4 engineering class. | So far my favorite prof at Rutgers, makes sure u understand everything, is clear in his explanations, speaks very loudly so everyone can hear, the homework is pretty long but thats what u should expect if ur taking calc 4 with anyone, exams are unbelievably straightforward, would go out of my way to have him teach me a class | I took him for Calc4, favorite professor thus far! You can tell he enjoys teaching. Don't use laptops, cellphones or any other electronic because he will call you out in front of everyone. Attend lecture, do the homework and you'll get the grade you want. Honestly he is a GREAT professor. | He is a good professor and you can learn a lot in his class. It is true that he gives a lot of homework but I think they are beneficial. | I'm currently a freshman and this is the first calculus class I've ever taken; I took precalc/trig senior year of high school and I still got a good grade. Prof teaches the subject material incredibly well; exams were somewhat difficult but very reasonable. Lenient with partial credit. Review sheets are helpful. Study hard and you'll do fine. | he is an awesome professor. His lectures are interesting and he makes calculus make sense. he is welling to help. After the exams, he stays in the class for as long as we want negotiating the partial credit. he gives sooo much homework. 60 problems per week. but he gives as many extensions as you want. he gives extra cridit assignments. | What a teacher, I used to skip his classes in the beginning but what a good teacher, he explains concepts crystal clear, knows when you're getting tired and is a liberal grader. I took Calc 151, and he's a must have teacher. Go for it! | Professor Peterson is one of the best math professors at Rutgers. Going into Calc III this semester, I was really worried, but this class was not as bad as I've heard. Just keep up with the homework and go to class. Grade is based on two midterms, a final (not cumulative), HW, and Maple assignments (which were easy). Take this class! | To put it bluntly, this man is an incredible lecturer. He's got a great grasp on the material and really explains everything clearly. Definitely had some great moments in class too. You'd be stupid not to attend. Do put in the study hours, and you'll find success. | Really good Professor. Usually finishes class a bit early. Explains everything we need to know for Exams. Gives a review sheet that really helps you prepare for the exams. Gives extra credit throughout the semester. Attendance not mandatory, but he wants you to pay attention in class (no phones, laptops) | He's very nice, and his exams are really easy. Do not use laptop or cellphone during class. He could get mad sometimes. His lecture goes really fast, but the textbook is pretty much straight forward,so you can just review the textbook. Make sure you do the homework. Overall, one of the best math professors. | Best math teacher at rutgers by far!! | Great professor. Not only are the exams easy, but he also cares for you to learn the material (which you will learn alot). Another plus is he keeps class engaged. I definitely recommend this professor. | Goes over the simplest problems in detail, & storms through the hard ones. He's really helpful with homework, just email him; the exams are easy for Calc 2, take his course if you can. | Amazing professor. By far, one of the best teachers I've seen at Rutgers. Comes off as strict in the beginning but opens up and makes tons of jokes throughout the semester. Explains everything very clearly and makes Pre-calc a lot more easy. Definitely recommend him! | Good Teacher. Explains things clear, relates it to everyday life things. Do the review sheet and exams should be very manageable. | Really good professor, very smart and helpful. I had him last year for the second part of Precalc. I think he and his God sent TA, Mariya Naumova is the best option for Precalculus. | This man is amazing!! Really straightforward, wonderful study guides. Failed it with Kinkabwala the previous semester, B+ with little effort. And I suck at math. All-around nice guy. | Collects homework every class so you kind of have to go, really straightforward exams just like the homework, really good teacher very clear, class average was a B which is really high for Calc 4 but its because he's really such a good teacher. def take him.. homework counts just as much as the final which really helps boost your grade | Honestly, if I had this prof last semester I wouldn't be taking this class a second time. He does call out people that text and talk in class, so avoid that. He's really clear and helpful. Also, in my opinion the curve on his exams is really good so take him if you can! | Moves fast when doing examples, but lots are done in class. Does a few of the homework problems that are assigned for the night. Before homework is handed in, any questions are answered, which is very helpful. Whatever you do, don't text/use laptop/fall asleep/be rude in class, or you will be embarrassed. Quite funny to see it. I'd recommend him. | Good professor. Exams aren't hard do his review sheets that he posts and you'll do well on his exams. Final was really hard though. Overall I'd recommend taking him if you can | This professor was really good and his TA was the best. He takes attendance at first then stops but i advise to attend each class. Honestly all you have to do is ask the right question during and exam or test and he will help you, he is really nice | He is funny and makes lectures interesting. His tests are pretty straight forward. There is a lot of homework but he grades it very fairly and it counts for a large part of your grade. I would definitely recommend taking him! The lectures fly by and he usually ends at least 15 minutes early. | Pre calc 112.He cracks jokes on people who fall asleep, text, read newspapers, etc. in class. He ended lecture early at times. He is extremely helpful and goes out of his way to help you. Go to his office hours. He gives make-ups and is very understanding.I like precalc because of this professor, I really enjoyed his class. | moves really fast, hard to keep up. homework is collected EVERY CLASS not just at recitation. exams aren't that bad, but it's still precalc so it still isn't fun. he embarrasses students by caling them out if they are reading a paper, book, doing hw, or texting. manditory attendance at first. | In the beginning, he was really creepy. But after the class started getting into it, he warmed up and started cracking jokes. Sometimes he is a little difficult to follow, but overall knows what he is talking about | He is willing to take extra time to make sure people understand the discussed concept before moving on. Doesn't overload you with work but doesn't give you a free ride either. He treats everybody with respect, but can still be humorous (such as when a cell phone rings... ""One salsa, one hip-hop""... (inside joke). | I had him freshman year and i hated him after the first class. But ended up loving the class. He is a good teacher, offers EC, is helpful and at times funny | A very helpful prof. I went into this class dreading it but after the first mid-term, i realized how much i actually learned. He teaches very well and is willing to slow down to make sure everyone in the class understands what is going on. I recommend him if you're taking calc. | Great teacher...willing to help you need it and tries to keep everybody interested in what he is teaching. | Comes off as very intimidating at first but is actually a very helpful professor. His classes are fast-paced but he can slow down when you ask him to. There is a lot of homework every class but the homework is more for your own good than your grade. He offers plenty of help outside of class when you need it. | Awesome. He does his best to make everybody understand the material. He'll explain anything to you, and even stay after class to talk if you need to. Doesn't accept late work, but assigns extra credit every once in a while."
"Wasserman, Eric","Differential equations is not super hard, and Professor Ling does teach well, when he wants to. He was pretty lazy, making the final grade based off one midterm, and one final. We lost a midterm due to him going on vacation. Grades are not regularly updated making everything very confusing once in a while. | Gave lots of hw at first, but he gladly cut it down when we asked him about it. Notes are super clear, and he gave clean lecture notes before class. Class could feel tedious bc he'd write out everything that was on the given notes, but he explained it well. References textbook often, but not required. Exams were hard, but he's pretty reasonable. | Makes his own notes, very nicely typed up. Textbook is more for reference, he follows his notes. Clear intuitive lectures, exams can be tough if you don't put the work in. Answers any question about material clearly. Great professor, 5 stars"
"Smythe, Iian","Great professor! Does tend to go through material quickly so you may have to review notes after class in order to understand. Very willing to help within his hours. | Professor Smythe was great at explaining whenever you had questions and/or needed help. He seemed to genuinely care about his students. Would definitely take another course with him. | Lecturer for my Math 215 section. He was great, approachable, and gave clear lectures. His office hours also helped a lot, and I wish I had gone to more! | Very approachable professor, and is dedicated to fostering academic excellence amongst students. Detailed in exploring concepts and approaches them intuitively. You can tell he prefers teaching analytical classes; most of our workshops and midterms were to test our knowledge beyond the scope of the class (note he kept in touch after the sem ended) | The best math prof I've ever had. After going into Calc 2 I now see how much of a god this man is. Amazing lectures, willing to answer questions, the only downside was that his workshops are very challenging. Exams are a breeze if you do the homework and the review. | Very helpful in class and makes sure students understand the material before moving on to the next subject. Often times, he got monotonous and kind of boring. Get ready for tough tests and workshops. | Professor Smythe set the bar extremely high for my first semester as a freshman, he clearly cares about his students and is willing to help them during office hours or after class. The class is not easy, especially if you've never taken Calculus, but if you put in the effort, then it's also not extremely difficult. | First class I ever failed, he is a very smart man but he rushes through topics. You can do well but you have to work your ass off. | Dr. Smythe is a great instructor. He genuinely cares for his students and his passions for math are extremely evident. He's a nice person to talk to and is always willing to help. | He's a great professor. He actually cares for his students. But, his midterms were hard because there was some theory involved. Overall, he's an amazing prof. | Amazing for students who aren't the best at math! He really goes above and beyond to make sure everyone has what they need for success in the class. Also was really nice and informative. The exams are easy as long as you go to class and keep up with the homework assignments. You'll learn a ton, but he makes it much easier than most math profs at RU | Nice guy and good lecturer. He answers questions and is specific about where you went wrong on homework, which always has an extra credit question. He also gives easy weekly online reading quizzes. Lecture attendance (not recitation) was not mandatory but I wouldn't advise skipping class. Exams are fair and not hard if you do review sheets."
"Mischaikow, Konstantin","Very nice and helpful professor, explains concepts clearly using simple examples, homework due once a week but takes a long time to do, interesting material, 1 midterm, 1 final, one ppt presentation, exams are similar to homework, breakoutrooms can get awkward bc no one talks sometimes, learned a lot, time consuming class, take notes during lecture | The class is not easy. And the way that he records lectures is not great. I would prefer him lecturing live. The homework is also unnecessarily hard and long. | not a hard class technically, it's just calc, but the lectures have nothing to do with anything. you need to self study everything because he just assumes you know, does proofs on the board the whole time, and explains things in a way that's 50 times more confusing than it needs to be. exams are not great and only sometimes curved | Although he was nice, lectures were disorganized and didn't really correspond to the exams. Midterms and final were very hard especially since I've only taken calculus classes prior to taking this course. Probably would best to take a Math 300 course first: he likes proofs, but the curve saved my grade and I'm thankful to be done with this course. | Not very understanding, I was in the hospital & he didn't accept my hw, lowest 3 hw grades dropped but make sure you try to do all the problems. Tests are easy if you do the hw, his lectures are disorganized but worth showing up to. There aren't a lot of prereqs but I suggest not taking it as a freshman & preferably taking Math 300 first. | He was definitely interested in the topic and instilled passion into his students. However the lectures often went on tangents, and were a little disorganized and didn't show the big picture very clearly. He just kind of showed theorems, proved them, and gave one or two examples, rinse - repeat. He was also not great with emails. Otherwise, good!! | Good Professor; Exams are fair and based off of class discussion/examples (and a little bit of homework). Very willing to help out students or explain things if you don't understand but is very busy so sometimes hard to reach (email is best)."
"Marszalek, Wieslaw","Very good professor. I recommend him. | Very good professor who knows what he teaches. Reasonable homework and quiz assignments. | Professor sticks to the course syllabus and offers extra credit assignments. Fair grader - drops the lowest quiz and homework grades. Too many of my classmates were completely unprepared to take this calculus course, for example many did not know the quadratic formula or how to graph quadratic functions. | Great professor. Offers extra credit assignments and the calculus concepts are illustrated by science and engineering applications. | Rude, told multiple students to stop attending class, I contracted COVID and didn't want to give extensions. Very unsympathetic, don't bother to ask for extensions. Not tech/online savvy, audio issues when teaching online lectures. | Great professor. Gives good feedback and examples, uploads a summary in Sakai after each lecture. Fair grader. | Good professor. The material is pretty boring but his lectures aren't terrible. Exams are not easy, but they're not too bad either. Fair grader and good lecturer in general. Can tell he loves this topic because of his research he showed us in it. | Marszalek is a brilliant man who, unlike most profs, can communicate his knowledge perfectly to a student level. His lectures are clearly written and carefully explained, and he is very good at answering questions. He is pleasant and accessible, and though grading is mostly up to the TA, he is will make small changes if you show you understand. | Very solid professor! Prepares you well for the finals exam and with a bit of studying A is very possible! However, his bi-weekly quizes are hard! | hes a good guy but lectures are kind of boring. he will help outside of class but you have to really pay attention and go out of your way to understand the material. he's caring but i wouldn't take his class again. | Dr Marszalek is really approachable. I really enjoyed CALC 151 because of him. He teaches very clearly. He also has clear notes. He is always willing to answer questions. He is understanding and helpful during the office hours. He is not an easy grader,however, he is very fair in a way you can not argue about. He is very caring about his students. | Prof. Marszalek is one of the smartest men I know. I had him in many different classes. Overall his math and teachings are very clear and useful. At the end of the day, if you pay attention and do all his work, you will learn a lot. I have and pretty grateful. | Overall good professor!Funny how he pronounces pythagorean theorem. | He is way too smart. He cannot bring himself to our level and with that is not able to teach. All he does is talk at you. He works and teaches like a robot. | Teaches class at a high level but if you put in effort you will learn a lot. He's a fair grader which you can't argue with. | He is AMAZING! He is very approachable. He cares about his student. He is tough... but as long as you work hard, you'll get what you deserve. | he can't teach | He is a very good teacher and teaches math through applicable interesting examples from circuits and physics. Very fair in grading. | HORRIBLE. The only thing he does best is putting you down. Any question is a stupid question for him. Forget about help. Take Prof. Gallardo, much better teaching methods. | He is way too smart to be teaching the hybrid class on the computer. Though he is way too strick and gives you the feeling he is better than you. I'd avoid him if you want to truly learn math. His teaching methods are totally not geared for your average college student. | HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE TEACHER. He was not interested in our class at all. He is unapproachable if help is needed. AVOID. | Very helpful, knows material very well. I enjoyed the class a lot. | Excellent professor; knowledgable; helpful. I learned a lot in Math315. | This guy is a genius. I think he is too smart to teach Math178. He knows his stuff, but since the material is so easy to him, he thinks everyone knows it. Should teach all the upper math courses. | He is very good, and he knows his stuff. The only way that you would get bad grade in his class is if you don't come to class. | He is the Best Math professor around. If you pass his class with a good grade, you know your stuff. As for everyone else, if you get a bad grade it's becuase you don't know how to work. Time for a new major, like garbage man! | WORST TEACHER EVER DOESNT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH HOW IS HE TEACHING | He is a very intellegent professor; however, he is unfeeling to trying and struggling students. He is rude and belongs in think tank not around students. | It's all about the Omega hOt! =)... Very tough to understand with the accent But generally he's a good guy. Ask for help if you need it. He will help."
"Ullman, Peter","I think Calc 1 is very doable if you have Professor Ullman. If you do the study guide/practice test he gives you, then you'll be perfectly fine for your midterms/final exams. Yes, the concepts in Calc 1 are moderately difficult, but if you need to take the course then Professor Ullman is very knowledgeable and ultimately very fair. | He's a decent lecturer, explains most calc concepts concisely rather deeply, which isn't the best quality in a math professor. What he doesn't lack is the fact that his exams are fair. If you do the HW assignments and go to the recitations, which I didn't do consistently, you will easily receive a better grade. Didn't study a lot either. | Great Lectures and Terrible Jokes. Do your job as a student and he will do his as a Professor. | Does things very rough, and it's hard to contact him (unless Zoom). Specific instructions to email him, which is confusing as to why he would even put an email in the canvas. VERY, a rough grader, and he took 3 points of recitation for messy and very messy I assure you it wasn't messy, and very specific on how he wanted his recitations done. | Prof. Ullman has detailed and clear lectures, always answers questions, and has some good jokes. Attendance isn't mandatory. Strongly recommend you go so you have an easier time. Exams, the best I can describe it is it's all fair. He tests you only what he teaches, gives practice material and review days. His grading, can be tough but fair. | Wasn't the worst professor and some of it was just that calc 2 is difficult, but for me he was not a good match. His lectures were hard to keep up with and stay awake. Very monotone, he did not do a good job with visualizing topics. Asking questions felt like he would make the topics way more complicated than they needed to be. Proceed with caution | Professor Ullman is the best math professor ever. His lectures an amazing, interactive, and funny. I truly enjoyed his class. He is an excellent professor and an understanding person. Do not be afraid to participate in his class. He surprisingly knows everyone by their names. Math is difficult but he makes it a lot better. | He posts previously recorded lectures for every topic throughout the semester that are actually watchable. I found the midterms to be a lot easier than the practice exams he would post but I definitely underestimated the final(got a 50). Chill approachable guy and his lectures were worth going to. | very straightforward. homeworks and recitation r not similar to the exam so don't waste time trying to understand them, just grind the exam review, and the exam will still be more straightforward than the review. take him, trust me. A is doable and B is very easy to achieve. i dont know how well it prepares you for calc 3 tho. | If you know nothing about calculus do not take this professor. His lectures were very much ""I assume you already have an understanding of this"" type style. If you have an understanding maybe he could work for you, but if you know nothing I suggest Professor Sequin for 151. (tbh failed bc it was too late to drop so I just gave up and did a retake) | I should've failed this class honestly. But that was my fault not Ullman, he was honestly a great professor. He was really approachable to ask questions to and explained topics well with example problems for every situation. The tests are HARD and there's a lot of hw, but will push back deadlines if for ex. theres a chem midterm on the hw due date. | Professor Ullman is a really funny guy. He throws in little jokes here and there during lectures to make them more tolerable, however they are still somewhat boring. Not to mention that he post exam grades weeks after students were supposed to receive them. He does care about his students though, which is rare nowadays. Overall, not horrible. | Peter Ullman was the coordinator for Calculus 151. He frequently posted practice exams a day late, at random hours of the night (2 to 5am). He raised the grade to a 90 for an A, never done in calculus at Rutgers before (typically grade scales are decided at end of semester post-curve). Practice exams were accurate to exams 1 & 2 however. | Avoid if possible! Lectures are boring and very heavy. If you miss even one class, you will be behind. He does provide accessible office hours and tries to give as many points possible. | Professor Ullman has a fun side and would occasionally make jokes during lectures which makes the class more enjoyable but when it comes to dropping grades or giving extra credit, he strictly follows the syllabus. Needless to say, he actually enjoys teaching and helping students, which honestly a lot to ask for when it comes to calc 2 professor. | SUPER funny dude, cares about his students and their health, AMAZING lectures. B/c of COVID, he posted videos of all his lectures so even when I couldn't attend I could catch up. His workshops and recitation quizzes were most important for the exams-- HW was pretty useless. Overall he's great for the material and the vibes :) Highly recommend. | Ullman is as good of a teacher as you're going to find for the material. Go to lecture, make sure you can do every type of problem you encounter in lecture and then do a couple different variations of those types of problems. There are no surprises on the exams. | Taught calc very well however exams and hw differed were not comparable at all. Hw taught you how to compute equations while exams were critical thinking word problems which you had to decipher and then think what to use for it. Overall an ok class as long as you put in effort | If you want to pass Calc 151 do not take this professor. His lectures were extremely unhelpful and complex. His exams were on an another level. A extremely hard grader and took points off over the smallest mistakes. I asked him once how should I study to succeed, and he told me everything. hired a tutor and still need to retake the course. | Professor Ullman was a great teacher! During lectures, he's witty and tries to keep the class interesting. He clearly enjoys teaching Calc and cares about his student's success. Lectures go at a moderate to fast pace and you should attend each one. Tests can be difficult and truly test if you understand the subject matter. | Math 152 is notoriously difficult; however, Professor Ullman does a really good job explaining the concepts. My advice would be to pay attention in lecture even if it becomes a little dry. He's the GOAT! | You can tell he's passionate about what he's teaching & that he cares about students understanding the material. The class is hard, but if you attend lectures & stay focused you'll do well. The tests are very fair, the reviews prepare you well. | Ullman is very helpful during office hours. He will help you work through problems you are having trouble with. I think the lectures are good for explaining the concepts, but I feel like they should focus more on how to do the actual questions. Many times the problems on the hw are slightly different and confusing enough to not know how to do them. | Great prof! Nice and funny. However, asynchronously, lectures were posted late and assignments were due right away. Barely went over difficult problems, so hw made you struggle a bit. But I'm happy with my grade and thought the exams were fair. I did make too many dumb mistakes on exams which reflected on my grade. An A is definitely doable!! :) | Professor Ullman was a pretty accommodating professor this semester. His pre-recorded lectures for this asynchronous class were pretty interesting and his examples were extremely helpful for the hw and the exams. This course does take effort, of course, but if you take notes of the lectures and understand the mylab hw, you should be in good shape! | Ullman is a pretty alright professor; I personally think that he does things a bit last minute, especially since we have him asynchronously. He's not bad though. He's really nice and understanding, but my only complaint is that his lectures aren't detailed enough and he doesn't post things in a timely manner. | People who give Ullman bad ratings might not have done optional homework problems. Recorded lectures are very well-made and almost always follow test questions and homework problems. Very difficult class, you must do optional homework. Strict deadlines, lots of homework and workshops, not the most considerate professor, but very capable | Im aware Calc 2 is a hard class but I felt like as the semester went on, he cared less. Lectures got less helpful, spends 50 minutes on an easy topic & then spends 10 on the hard part. Lecture examples look nothing like the HW or Quizzes. We were just thrown to the wolves for the final, where NOTHING was posted except 150 MC Q's with no solutions. | You can tell he is passionate about math but he's a little too high and mighty and expects you to know exactly the theory he explains. AVOID if you're taking him asynchronous as a freshman I came in blind and his time management with posting lectures was awful. But at least he moved the due dates for HW over. Class assignments werestraightforward | Calc 2 itself is going to be a struggle alone. While Prof. Ullman's class is no exception, he has made the class feel rewarding for me. You will have a lot of info & lessons thrown at you in a short period of time, but that's the nature of Calc 2. His online lectures often had quirky humor which always helped reduce my stress about that. Great guy! | I wish he didnt go so fast. He thinks were mathematicians that can keep up with his work and I hate it. Not the best at explaining since he goes so fast | Worst lectures ever! | Ullman is amazing, I'll be taking him again later. Does a wonderful job explaining concepts, makes calc fun and engaging for students who care. When we transitioned to online, he would make sure everyone was on the same page and doing ok. You may not do well on the first exam but if you put in the work, he will know and it will pay off. 10/10 icon. | I had him this semester and he was hands down one of my favorite professors that I have had so far. Lectures can get boring at times, but examples are engaging and you have to just take notes. Homeworks and all grading is fair and he is a really nice and wholesome guy. Really enjoyed his virtual corona lectures :) | He doesn't really explain the formulas, which was a big issue for me. He mainly teaches through examples, so I didn't really understand when and why I should use certain formulas. If you take him definitely make sure you're watching Youtube videos throughout the semester to understand the basic concepts. | I forgot to fill out my SIRS on you so I'm posting here! Very good professor, honestly funny and genuine. He teaches the material thoroughly but you have to really pay attention for it to stick or else you could slip up. If you do find yourself slipping go to him and ask for help and he will help you succeed. Very good professor! | I don't know how Ullman has as low of a rating as he does. He provides every single example of types of problems that will be on the homework and exams. He takes time during the lecture to answer any questions the students have. For as difficult as this class is, Ullman makes it easier through his great teaching ability. He also is hilarious. | He is not the best choice if you are a math/physics major and actually need to understand why formulas work. He skips proving theorems/formulas and concentrates on examples only. | GOAT PROFESSOR. If you go to class, study for quizzes, do homework, do the suggested textbook problems found on the Rutgers math department website, you will get an A. (actually gotta study tho) | The final exam for Calc 135 is the most difficult thing about the course. It's also worth a lot of points like a lot of other classes. However, it is not impossible to do well, but still hard. If you pay attention to him it'll actually help a lot. Occasionally he'll try to make a few jokes. Other than that, he is actually a very good professor. | Calc2 is infamously the hardest class at Rutgers, and I think the odds were in my favor because I didn't find it that bad thanks to Ullman. He gives key example problems in class and explains concepts exceptionally clearly, interspersed by his characteristic dry dad-jokes. Never even had to open the textbook. Stay on top of the Webassign/Workshops. | The subject matter for Calculus is awful to begin with and his lecture only made it worse. The notes given to us in lecture were absolutely useless and will not help you pass any of the exams. With this said, my friends and I were basically left to our own devices to find/figure out/practice problems that would help us excel on the exams. | Professor Ullman is a very communicative, empathetic and fair professor. He recognizes the flaws in the math department and does his best to mitigate them for you. You can talk to him before, during and after class/office hours, he is always willing to help. His only flaw is lack of deriving theorems/formulas so I wouldnt recommend him to math maj | His exams are very fair; attendance is not required. And he will upload all in-class notes on Sakai, so skip class is fine. Just follow what he assigned, doing homework and workshop, preparing for weekly quizzes, then there is no way to fail this course. | Possibly the best mathematics professor I have had to date. Made the hard concepts in calculus 2 seem much easier and clearer to comprehend. He puts his class notes online, as long as you practice and go to the lectures you will be fine. Tries to make class fun, would take again, definitely not too old to tech. | I was really nervous going into calc but prof Ullman was a great lecturer and helped me make sense of everything. His office hours are really helpful and he often explains things better there than in the actual class. Great guy doesn't get enough credit | Professor Ullman is quite fair in terms of his exams and its content. He provides many key example problems in his lectures that you may find a variation of on his tests. He's very approachable and will not hesitate to walk through other examples to get you to understand the content. The course itself is hard of course but Ullman mkes it manageable | The homework problems that he assigned were very representative of the types of problems on the exams. He made it very clear about what he expected from us and putting in the effort will really pay off. He also has this interesting sense of humor that I liked. | I thought he did a great job teaching linear algebra for the first time. Clearly knows his material, answers questions and works slowly. Notes are uploaded online. It is not difficult material the hard part is staying focused during class. Quizzes once a week but if you go to class they can't be too bad. Overall solid choice for linear algebra... | Prof Ullman understands calc but the way he explains it to his students makes it more complicated. The recitation teacher would teach me the same material in a simpler way. I took calculus in high school and attended every lecture but I did not feel prepared for the midterm/final exam. His notes are a bit confusing but he's genuinely a nice man. | His exams are nothing like his lectures. WebAssign isn't assigned in a timely manner and his exams are hard and so is the overall course. | Prof. Ullman is a very quirky professor and he teaches his class well. His linear algebra course was a breeze although you HAVE to do the homework and listen to his lectures in order to do well. His exams were VERY fair, so if you did the homework and understood how to do it, then you'll have no problem in the class. | He's nice. The exam is easy but you need to notice everyone get good grade on the exam. So if he take percentage to decide who's A, it would be hard. | Nice professor. Calc is generally hard but, you have to put in a lot of effort to do well. | Professor Ullman is not there to make you fail. He is always willing to help, and all of the resources that he provides really guide you. I did all the recommended textbook problems and attended every lecture. I recognized how to do every question on the exams, which were 100% fair based on what was taught in lecture. Highly recommend. | Professor Ullman specifically said people only write reviews when they don't like the class, so I'm here to do the opposite. Ullman is very clear on all material and gives you all you need to do well in class. Attendance isn't mandatory but helps so much when it comes to learning the material. Class notes are online, exams are just like homework. | Some of the past reviews are despicable. He's a fantastic teacher. Few big things going for him: he speaks perfect english (hard to come by), he teaches off of a projector and all of his notes are super clean (and he posts them all online), and his exams are very reasonable to what you learn. Great professor, awesome guy, wants everyone to get an A | I took this in the fall and I wish I skipped class more. I took calc in high school and it was harder than this. He's a nice guy, but his voice is so monotone and boring. No point in showing up if you already took AP Calculus in high school. Only show up for recitation and exams. First exam is a little hard, everything else is a breeze. | Professor Ullman is a great guy, clearly has good intentions with all of his students. He's willing to slow down and explain when asked to do so. Very good guy, big fan | Professor Ullman is really nice and down to earth guy. I took him for Math of Money, to fulfill my math requirement. Lecture may drag a bit, but that's more due to the subject matter than anything. Announces quizzes in advance and posts all class materials online. Doesn't take attendance. Spent a few hours studying before exams and was fine. | You will be teaching yourself all of the material. Ullman is a nice guy but explains concepts and ways of doing problems in very confusing ways. I went to extra help with him a few times and I still couldn't understand what he was talking about when he tried to explain certain topics. Tests are extremely difficult too and you might need a tutor. | Course is a lot of work if you haven't already taken Calc. You'll most likely end up teaching urself the material since examples done in lecture don't always go along with homework (graded). He's willing to help when needed, but material only gets trickier. Tests are much more difficult then practice problems or hw. Go to recitation. | Be prepared to teach everything to yourself as he cannot teach anything. He has a monotone voice which is extremely boring. His lectures are painful to sit through. His exams are unbelievably difficult. If you have no calculus background DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! | Don't listen to anyone who says Ullman is a bad professor for 152. He literally helps anyone who comes to him for help and is the fairest grader I have encountered at Rutgers, which helps for the hell that is calc2. | Professor Ullman is a solid choice for Calc II. He speaks softly but not to the point where it makes you fall asleep. He is very clear with explanations and does tons of example problems during lectures. Those same problems show up in his exams, which were less tricky than other calculus professors'. Do the textbook problems and you should be okay. | Whatever you do, PLEASE do not take this professor. His lectures are extremely boring, very monotone, can't even teach students who have no prior knowledge of the material he is teaching mainly because while he is teaching, he is pretty much talking to himself. His exams are ridiculously hard and don't even prepare you for the final exam. | Very good annotated notes. Detailed lecture and a good lecturer. Easy open notes quiz every Wednesday (grade booster). Have to buy the textbook because of homework assignments."
"Zurovchak, James","Worst teacher ever. Never got to learn anything. Now principal at Saint Peter's Prep and doesn't do anything. I hear people there don't like him either. | really easy, very rarely did the required readings and could still participate. Won't learn anything new, but if you go to class you'll probably get an A | St. Peter's high scholl teach. Great guy | He was my highschool teacher. | No Comments"
"Sesum, Natasa","Very difficult class with weekly homework, two midterms, and one final. Very forgiving curve. Good professor but the lectures are done very fast you can barely keep up with the handwriting. | Calc 5. Her breakneck lecture speed is ridiculous, making it impossible to absorb anything. I stopped attending lecture after only a few weeks since it was entirely useless. The textbook, TA, and YouTube were my best friends. It's a shame, as she really is nice, has good review sessions, and gives fair exams, but the learning itself was nightmare. | DO NOT take this lady UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE. She goes lightning speed for no reason and does not care about teaching. I speak 4 lang and i still cant understand her. We were like weeks ahead of other calc 5 classes and for what??? The HW is so hard and Exams worse. Also her lecture notes were CRUMPLED UP PAPERS. Don't do it please save urself | Calc 5. The worst. Exams were unreasonably difficult and even with cheatsheets I found myself constantly struggling. She goes to fast in class to the point its difficult to even copy down what she writes. Avoid if you can, other profs have better grading schemes and actually care about their classes. | Had Sesum during quarantine. She provides good resources and answers all questions and doubts during lectures. However, I did the bulk of my learning using MyMathLab homework to get a good grade in this course. The lectures can be a little dull but the material is indispensable! | Best Calc 2 professor. She gives u a review before the tests which are very very close to the exams. Very sweet and understanding. She genuinely cares and wants students to do better. Just remind her to start recording lecture at the beginning of class because she tends to forget. For exams just re-watch her lectures and its enough | I had for for calc2 and she is by far one of the best professors I have had. The class is hard, but shes an amazing teacher who makes it possible to get an A. I ended with an A in her class only because of her teacher. If I was with another professor, I would have failed. The reviews are so helpful. They are very similar to the exams. | She likes to hear feedback from the quizzes and problems we have regarding the material. Her lectures get boring and with calc being online, i tend to forgot that im in class (not her fault though). She does want us to succeed. You have to show up to zoom for participation, workshops were annoying but its calc II what do u expect | !!had her during covid!! Calc 2 is one of the hardest classes you'll EVER take. I got so lost during lecture but compared to the other profs, she's prob the best choice (the others make life so difficult). Even tho she's hard to understand, she's still open to answering questions & really makes sure u understand (even tho i didnt lmao) | Natasa is the best math professor i have had at rutgers. She cares that you understand the material and do well. Yes calc requires a bit of work on your part but you have so much material to work with. Just study hard and you should do really well. Wish I could have her again | Prof Sesum is brilliant. She's more than fair with her tests and offers great help during her office hours. The homework that she assigns is much harder than her tests which prepares you well. Greatest math professor I've had, would take again. | She speaks really fast during the class. You have to 100% focus on what she writes on the board. But those materials are very helpful. I took her math 311 last semester. She made my life easier. The review session is very helpful and also she is a very kind person. Good experience at all. I will definitely take her class again. | So far at Rutgers she was the best teacher I had. I didnt go to lectures because I felt I could have learned the same material from the textbook. But she is very fair and prepares you well for her exams. Definitely do all her review problems a week before her exams and go through them until you know how to do each problem. It will prepare you. | She made a hard subject somewhat enjoyable. Grades on a curve. Gives great reviews right before exams. As far as math professors go she's one of the best i've had. | boring | Was very organized with her lecture and had many examples. She was good at answering questions and only had the slightest accent. | The best math professor I've had thus far at Rutgers. She goes very fast because there is a LOT of material to cover, but as long as you pay attention and take good notes, you'll do well. Pay special attention to her formula sheets! | Course is a little labor intensive but not too bad. Professor flies through material in lecture and is sometimes hard to understand. DEFINITELY study the review sheets, exam questions were often taken DIRECTLY off of them. Study hard, stay calm, and know how to approach each type of problem, and you will do fine. | This professor is simply great! She is lucid and concise in her lectures and she always gives people exams that are completely fair. There is nothing on her exams that is extremely difficult. She is also kind and always willing to help. Also if you want to get an A study her review sheets she takes everything off from her review sheets | Excellent professor - very fair exams with questions right off the review sheet with minimal modification. Knows material like the back of her hand; she doesn't simply regurgitate material onto the chalkboard. Beware: she goes 1000 MPH so read the text before lecture! | Not readily comprehensible and not remotely engaging. She's a sweet lady, but no teacher."
"Cogar, Samuel","Good instructor for Math 373 online! | Dr. Cogar is such a great lecturer. He really makes sure that you understand the material. There is not much homework, but the final project can be kind of annoying. He sort of assumes that you understand how to write MATLAB code, which is not a prerequisite for the course. Despite that, I would definitely take Dr. Cogar again! | I can't stress enough how great Professor Cogar was for calculus 2. He is good and I would take him again if I could. | Amazing professor. Teaches really well and gives good feedback for your work. | Getting a C+ yet still liking the professor speaks a lot. Cogar is nerdy that he is cutely admirable. Cogar is hilarious. Cogar helped me understand a subject that I had so much struggle in. In the end, I blame the fact that class was hard was because of the math department. Give Cogar a chance. | Prof. Cogar's lecture is clear, patient, interesting, and well-organized. He makes sure everything he teaches is well-motivated, and he never seems impatient when someone asks him to re-explain a concept. He relates the content to funny historical context or his own research, making you want to learn more. He is a treasure to Rutgers. Take his clas | Had Prof Cogar for Math 300, which people usually consider a difficult course, but Prof Cogar made it very manageable due to his amazing teaching skills. He also gives a very reasonable amount of homework, which I think more profs should do instead of just bombarding students with ton of homework. Hands down, one of the best profs I have had. | Dr. Cogar has been the best professor I have ever had. He is passionate about what he teaches, and he does a great job conveying information for a rather difficult course. I believe his averages for both midterms were higher than the other professors. He manages to make a difficult and boring subject quite the opposite. 10/10 | Great professor, I had him for calculus 2 and I am very lucky for this. He is funny, caring, and genuinely wants to teach students calculus. As long as you go to lecture every time and listen to him intently, then you will definitely pass. Of course since Calc 2 is a difficult course, you will NEED to study an hour every day in days before midterm. | Very helpful outside of class and goes slow enough in lecture so you can follow difficult material more easily. You can tell that he's genuinely excited about the material, which allows him to communicate it better. Sometimes goes off on funny little tangents that make class easier to get through, especially during early morning lectures."
"Toprak, Ebru","While she is very intelligent and knowledgable in her field, her teachings skills are very lacking. I think she forgets that she's lecturing students and not discussing the material with her colleagues. As such, the lectures move very fast and go in way too much depth for an undergrad course. Overall, she's super sweet but our class average was 49. | Solid lectuerer, funny accent, and quite fast at responding to emails. I think this class was easier because i took it online. The material can be conceptually tough to grasp if you've never taken math past calc 2. ONLY relying on learning from lectures isn't enough in this class. The HWs help a LOT and the exams are not impossible, but not easy. | Professor Toprak is really sweet and caring. She is, without a doubt, a true genius. However, she is also a terrible lecturer (unprepared and hard to follow). Plus, her homework is a lot harder than anything you do in class and her exams, in turn, are even harder. While she's a lenient grader, you won't learn much from her class. | I took differential equations with her, it's important to try and study closer to the lectures than the book since her exams are tough and come mainly from lectures and less from book work. Overall, not the worst, but stay close to lectures and ask questions | Besides her funny accent and clear and straightforward lectures, Professor Ebru is an amazing, relatable person who takes time to answer your questions and makes sure that you enjoy material. Homework is easy enough and tests are straightforward and easy; stay engaged, participate, enjoy the spirals; Calc4 doesn't get any easier andrelaxingthanthis | Gives tests that are nice Not bad Would not take Calc 2 again | Professor Toprak was extremely unclear and not confident when explaining the subject matter in lecture. She makes lots of algebraic mistakes (which she even jokes about) and her practice exam answer keys are full of errors. I had to use the webassign homework to be able to understand my notes, which is obvious the opposite how how it should be. | The lectures were okay at the best and that might be because I did not like her approach to teaching. However, the tests were pretty easy and she will do her best to clear your doubts. | Had her the first time she was teaching at Rutgers. She was a decent lecturer, but sometimes used weird methods of solving problems different than the TA. Wants you to participate in class and seems to be accommodating of what students want. Tests aren't too hard and said she would make it easier after seeing the average on the first one."
"Sosa, Jose","The professor can be confusing, but his workshops help break down concepts. Definitely use resources like Unstuckstudy for study prep - it really saved me time. | DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS I'M WARNING YOU. Professor has no idea how to teach, no empathy for students, if you struggle with anything he tells you to ""figure it out"" on your own. Lectures are useless and he doesn't teach at all, and if you go to office hours he just reads the problem out loud to you. | If you see him on your schedule RUN! He doesn't explain the problems well and expects you to just know the material. He didn't really teach the class he really just talked at the class. When the class came together to talk about how we were all collectively struggling with the material and how he was teaching he got super defensive and angry. | Would not recommend did not understand a single word the whole semester. And he's got an attitude.. | He seriously does NOT explain things well while trying to teach, understandable in the beginning because he came from higher level classes but either way, it affected my grades and ability to understand the formulas a lot. Incredibly disappointed in him and myself. | IF YOU SEE THIS NAME SWAP OR DROP/WITHDRAW THE CLASS! DOES NOT HELP AT ALL AND WILL GATEKEEP ALL THE HELP. HIS ""HELP"" IS TELLING YOU TO ""FIGURE IT OUT"". STAY FAR AWAY!!! | Despite other reviews, I actually really liked Professor Sosa. He's very approachable and always helps out during office hours, and you can tell he cares about his students. He does tend to go a bit fast in lectures, but honestly its nothing crazy and you can always go home and review. | If you can please try to avoid this professor. I currently have him for intermediate algebra, he's a nice guy but he's used to teaching higher level classes, he goes way too fast for us and his explanations never make sense. He also makes mistakes with his own work often which throws us off. Quizzes every week too, It's not worth it. | God awful professor. He adds extra topics on midterms when no other class has to do it. He definitely hates his life and takes it out on his students. Never take this dudes class. | Do not take any class with this professor. Im currently in one of his classes right now and it is impossible. I love math and have always done well in it but the minute I get in his classroom every love for it is gone. Can not understand his own notes. Grades super strict and does not even give feedback. Test every single class and they are terribl | Do yourself a favor and please do not take this class. Though the professor is nice, he is a tough grader, adds more topics to exams than any other class does, and when he presents his notes, he jumps quickly from one to another because at the end of the day, it's not about if the class gets it all about if he can actually understand his own notes. | There are three words that can be used to describe this class. DON'T TAKE IT! | I really like Prof Sosa. He's friendly and approachable. Despite asking for a recommendation letter only 3days before ddl, he graciously write it for me. The quizzes can be challenging, but he allows you to ask, make corrections, and then submit them. He's a patient and thorough teacher and easy to understand if you ask him questions one-on-one. | Horrible Teacher, can barely understand him, grades so roughly, very negative on feedback. | DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Extremely unclear explanations that confuse you more in the end than anything. Save yourself the headache and find a different professor for this course. | I had Professor Sosa for Calc135 Recitation. He is really knowledgeable of the material and tries to help students as much as he can. The office hours are helpful for some questions and are held multiple times a week. The professor also responds to emails quickly. However, he explains some of the problems a little confusingly compared to lecture. | I had Professor Sosa for recitation. I took him because my main lecturer was Rasha Abadir, a great professor. Sosa is a very sweet man, but he explains things in a confusing manner and grades quizzes harshly. He is willing to answer questions, but sometimes his explanations are unhelpful. I would not recommend taking him. | He was a nice guy, but not the best teacher. He gave worksheets during class, and only went over a few problems before giving us our weekly quiz, most of which were tough. You have to put in the work before class and do many practice problems to succeed in this class. | Professor Sosa is incredibly knowledgeable. He will try his utmost best to explain any question you have without being annoyed. Overall a decent professor for Calc 135. | Thick accent, mediocre at best in terms of teaching content. | I had Professor Sosa as my recitation teacher for Calc 135. I really don't understand all of the bad reviews. He's a nice guy, his quizzes were typically pretty easy, and graded fairly. There is a quiz each recitation, but 2 of the lowest grades are dropped by the end of the course. | This professor is AWFUL. I was basically my own professor for the entirety of this course. I did well because I did so much extra work on my own that would have been unnecessary with a competent professor. I generally like math, but this professor ruined it for me. CLASS IS DOABLE, THE TEACHER IS NOT!!! | Do not take Sosa. He is such a tough grader and will take points off for the most minor things ever. His recitations are boring and confusing (not a good combo). He will give you the quiz in the last 10 mins of class, you usually will go over the time though because he fails to explain everything during recitation. Not a good experience. | He's very kind, but his teaching is terrible. Doesn't understand the questions that are asked of him and spends too long ""explaining"" with no substance to his words. Reviews exactly what'll be on the quizzes, which is nice, but his teaching of the content is god awful. I took Calc AB last year, so I'm lucky, but I feel bad for those that haven't. | He has good intentions and wants his students to learn, but he really does not know how to teach the concepts. Instead, he more goes over what he knows in a somewhat chaotic manner that makes it harder to truly understand what he's doing and why. Asking him questions is difficult because he doesn't know how to answer or explain. | Very harsh grader. A bit confusing, but to his credit he kind of gets his point across most of the time. However, he usually only explains either the concept or the big-picture problem-solving procedure. | He might not be a good professor before, but he had turned nice. He explains concepts before every workshop and do listen to students. I'm going to take 251 with him again. | Prof. Sosa is definitely a well intentioned man. However, he does not clarify concepts anywhere nearly enough clearly and explains problems in a complex manner. I highly recommend to not bother attending the recitation sections and to do the assigned workshop problems on your own. He is a difficult grader as well, so make sure you detail all work. | I had him for Fall calc 151 at Rutgers, god awful recitation teacher. Doesn't explain anything and put us straight into break out room, expect us to learn the topic and do hard conceptual questions on ourselves. He grades on his standards and doesn't tell you what you did or why it's marked wrong. Switch out ASAP if you have him | Currently taking Calc 152 with him online over the summer. Almost half of our assignments have not been graded including workshops dating back to before the first exam. He fails to post homework assignments on time, and gives quizzes almost every class if he remembers to post the homework. T | This my second time taking the class and it is a summer class so it is faster. But honestly, I have been learning everything through online sources and tutors. He is a nice guy, but he can't really teach. He doesn't really know what is going on and seems to be lost most of the time. I tried to go to office hours and he confused me more. | The following is a review for his Calc 152 summer class. One of the worst professors I've ever had. Lectures are long and confusing; homework takes hours to complete. There is at least one quiz per week. More than half the class failed the first exam and he refuses to acknowledge this. Doesn't stay on top. Not helpful, even during office hours. | Terrible at online teaching. Jumps around and explains nothing at all. I have to attend his 2-hour lecture then watch a 3-hour lecture on youtube, and get help from various sources in order to do my homework, and it's still damn near impossible. Worst experience I have ever had, but this is not atypical if you're going to Rutgers. | I'M CURRENTLY TAKING CALC 135 WITH HIM-- THIS IS MY SECOND TIME TAKING THIS CLASS AND I AM CURRENTLY ON TRACK FOR A HIGH B. HE IS APPROACHABLE AND ANSWERS ALL QUESTIONS. HE CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS WHO PUT FORTH EFFORT. RECOMMEND HIM ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE RETAKING CALC 135 OVER THE SUMMER. | He's kind of awkward, but is a pretty good recitation instructor overall. He goes over any questions you may have, and his quizzes at the end of class are exactly like the practice problems that he does right before. Sometimes he even leaves his notes on the board during quizzes which is great. | As a student who struggled with 135 and failed before, taking Jose was a blessing in disguise. While outside of the class work is still needed to do well, Jose definitely cares about his student and wants them to do well. Don't listen to these horrible reviews on this professor, Calc is tough no matter who you have, but Jose is a fine professor | Amazing guy, just get used to his style. Best recitation professor | Heavy handed grader; will dock lots of points if things are ""sloppy"" or otherwise poorly done in his eyes, even if the procedure is correct. Made recitation hell. Not understandable by any stretch of the word. | Shocked by reviews because I found the recitation with him to be very helpful. He did all of the problems that we asked him to do and explained them clearly. Gave lots of helpful review problems before exams. A reasonable grader and pleasant to talk to. Has a very slight, nice-sounding accent (English is very clear and correct). | he explains things extremely well. I don't understand why people don't like him. He can come off as a little snotty, but honestly explains the material extremely well. He also goes over the exact material that's gonna be on the quiz before he gives out the quiz | Had him for TA for calc 151. I can see why people find it difficult to learn from him, but I had him for recitation and it was ok. He often puts the same questions gone over in the recitations on the quiz so as long as you're there and know your material, it's whatever. | The TA was very in his own mindset and did not care much for what the students had to say. He was not very helpful when asked to go over a math problem from the homework or the recitation. He would through it or say that he doesn't have time and then would proceed to just walk around the room. Absolutely terrible! DO NOT TAKE by all means if poss. | he's a face who gives impossible problems and every point we lose during the semester on an assignment, he absorbs to make him stronger do you think is a qt incredible! | I have him for recitation, he speaks slightly broken english, his workshops are impossible and you should expect yourself spending hours on it just for 5 points. Also tough grader, so those hours will get you maybe 3 points Literally did not review anything from lecture. Avoid if possible. | do not take this class if you can't self-teach. If you're taking calc 1 you should be fine, if you're taking calc 2 you should still be fine as long as you teach yourself everything. Easy A if you do the work | Calc 152 is REALLY HARD no matter what professor you have. Prof. Sosa is a really kind person who really cares about you and is passionate about math. Unfortunately, his lectures can be confusing, he gets confused, and he makes a good amount of mistakes. But, if you pay close attention and ask questions, you should be fine. | Sosa gives very unclear lectures. He seems nervous while lecturing and answers questions poorly and vaguely. I do think he's a good guy but he's not a good professor. Recitation is where I learned all the material. Tests are not easy and the average was very low. Class is challenging but not impossible -- I did manage to get an A. | Even after hearing the nightmare reviews given to this professor by my fellow students,. I figured ""how bad could he bed?"" He is that bad. I was lucky enough to withdraw from the class, but the experience was a complete nightmare. He laughed at me when I asked a question about the material, and refused to help in office hours. | Being good at calculus in high school, I thought that this class would be easy. Boy, was I wrong. Sosa laughs at students who ask legitimate questions and spends thirty minutes on problems, then erases them when he figures out they were wrong the entire time. Not to mention his exams are incredibly unfair. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! | Very difficult to understand. He is not clear in lecture, and over-complicates most topics. He does explain some stuff quite well, but focuses on too much theory and not enough application. Must do assigned homework problems in textbook to do well. Webwork problems as well. I strongly urge you to attend each lecture. You do not want to fall behind. | only take this class for an easy A if you a beast in math | Awful professor. I took calc in high school and loved it. With a calc background, his class was still nearly impossible. Attended every lecture and did all the homework, yet still barely passed. He does not help students at all and is unorganized. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. | Professor Sosa is by far one of the worst professors at Rutgers. He is unclear, unorganized, and disconnected. He has no desire to help his students understand the material. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM. He is horrible. Its like you are teaching yourself the whole time, just to scrape up a passing grade. Avoid at all costs. | don't think that you can do well in this class because you can't. his exams are insane and his reviews for the exams are not helpful. i only passed the second exam because i got a copy from the year before, he doesn't change much. DO NOT TAKE HIM he is incredibly difficult and will give you SO much unneeded stress | I took calculus in high school, so i thought I would be fine in Calc. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE. Exams are ridiculously hard. If the final wasn't worth 45 percent, I would have an F in the class. My TA was wonderful, but explore others if possible. He's a nice guy, however, his exams are unfair. | I did very well in Calc last year in high school and I knew that the professor was not recommended but it fit my schedule so I kept the class, figured it would simply be review. Not a good idea. I don't know how students with no previous calc experience do it, he laughs at students and is unclear. Save yourself the stress DO NOT TAKE HIM. | Overall, terrible professor. Is not helpful, though i had previous knowledge of calc through high school, this man made the class so much harder than it actually was. i made the mistake of taking him, luckily i had an easy TA which made things easier. I highly relied on Homework/quizes and the final is 40%. DO NOT TAKE | worst calc professorhe honestly should be fired i know more than people in other calc classes and they get 90s when our averages are in the 40-50s. quizzes in recitation have no correlation to exams because he makes exams 20x harder then classroom work quizzes and hmwk. hopefully the curve will allow me to get atleast a c in the class. dont bother | don't take this guy. unless you're a beast at calc | HE IS TERRIBLE. I took Calc 135 at rutgers and got an A, so coming into this class I figured I'd have a good background. He does not explain anything and whispers to himself while he teaches; very unclear when he speaks. Sometime he will erase complete explanations after he realizes he taught the wrong thing for an hour. DO NOT TAKE HIM. | Try to get a person who is clear.His exams are difficult but durable instead of 2+2 its e^2+ ln you could still do it if you truly understand the process. | Bad prof ever, he tries to explain but no one could understand! | Do not choose him as your professor. He does not know how to teach. His lecture makes you even more confused. All he does in the class is writing equations with poor explanation. | With no background in Calculus, I entered this class thinking it wasn't going to be too hard considering I've done well in math before. Nope, midterm average was in the 40's and lecture is at 8:10 in the morning which is brutal since his lectures are dry and not clear as it is. It's true, he laughs at students. He seems intelligent, but can't teach | If you are not a genius at calc do not take this class. I repeat do not take math with him in general, he even makes his 135 class really difficult. He will crush you dreams. He may be very knowledgable, but he simply does not have the teaching ability. If you do take it.. do the homework, ask questions, and go for outside tutoring. | He's honestly not as bad as everyone says. You're goona have to put effort into this class but that's the way most classes work. Redo his class problems and do a few extra ones in the book and you'll be ok | Terrible professor. Lectures are beyond useless. He does not understand that there are students who have never taken calc before in his class. An average exam score in the 30s is a pretty clear indication that a vast majority of the class is not learning anything from him. If you end up with him, find another professor asap | Last exam average was a 30%, enough said. | Nice guy, but not a good professor. When he does problems it is difficult enough to understand him and even harder to understand his work. Exams are hard to the point that they help absoloutely nobody. If you can opt out of this class do it immediately. | His lecture classes are pointless because he goes over the most simple examples and sometimes gets stumped on his own exam review questions. Don't know how he's a professor."
"Barreto-Aranda, Victor","Though a TA, he was the worst part of the class. His thick accent made him incomprehensible, and he often sounded rude. A strict grader, he deducted points without explaining his answers. By the third recitation, students stopped listening to his ""help,"" attending only for required quizzes. Also, he banned scientific calculators in a MATH class. | Victor is the goat and idk why everyone's leaving bad comments. He wants us to do well, it's just that nobody cares. He goes over certain problems and isn't unintelligible. Only reason he grades tough is because the math department grades tough - it helps prepare us for exams. I didn't like Victor much at first, but he has grown on me. | He was awful! Recitation is supposed to help you understand the material better. It was the opposite, he actually made me more confused. I do not understand how he is a professor for such a hard topic. If you get him as a recitation professor, try and get a different one! | He is practically unintelligible and usually will not actually answer your questions about material | He clearly wants us to do our best but he comes across as harsh and unforgiving. His grading is unnecessarily difficult, taking off tons of points for even small mistakes (and his written feedback just makes you feel like an idiot). His accent and tone of voice are pretty unbearable too | (Recitation) Sit in front to hear! Unreasonable grader. I got 4/5 questions fully correct and 1/5 partially correct, and he gave a 60%. This is just one of many cases. Grade seems to be random if you didn't perfectly answer all questions. Unclear feedback (writes ""NO!"" next to incorrect questions). He fortunately reviews lecture content concisely. | Worse professor ever. Recitations were of no use whatsoever. Only cares about writing the whole English statements in the workshop. Seemed like an English class rather than a math one. Avoid at all costs | the latest should be math152, not math251. Additionally, why i got 1 of 10 is that i haven't written the useless English statements, even if i have a complete solution and a correct answer. Hope those who would have math152 class can avoid choosing this Peruvian's class, or you will regret for the whole semester!!! | 1. Never be late. That's the only right thing, but compared with other teachers ""could be late but not too much"", i think it's not an appropriate welcome. 2. strange accent and low voice. When i was in the last row, i can't hear what he said. 3.2-3 statements for each problem. A math problem needs so many statements? If not, only 1/10 like me. etc. | This professor requires us to copy the questions and mandatory to write down words through solving a MATH problem. There are way too much useless rules about workshops. He graded super hard toward workshops. When there is no test during recitation, we can not leave early even if we finish all the works. | Never get high scores for workshop questions even you get the correct answer. Strange rules for marking papers. He is trying his best to give low grades. | Bad | He try his best to make difficult to his student. All the grades are unreasonable, never follow his grade standard which he gave us at the beginning class. The workshop is too easy to achieve the mid term, however it is impossible to get full grade in his class even you achieve all the request. His strange accent is hard to understand. Worst one. | He never trust his students, always thinks they are cheating or not hardworking. The worst primate I have ever met. None can get full points for his workshop, he will try his best to not give you high grades. Do not take his course or recitation, if you can avoid him. | I dont understand his terrible accent. | This professor is terrible. His accent is completely unbearable. If you get the correct answer & don't show your work the way he likes it, you'll get no credit. I had him for recitation so he graded all my exams and quizzes. He spends the entire recitation going over questions that no one even asked. He takes 40 minutes to go over 2 problems. | Very easy grader and a really nice guy, his tests are directly homework problems, do the homework and his class is an easy A. However, his lectures are pretty dry and his accent is bearable. He is Peruvian, but studied in Russia for 25 years, try to imagine that accent. Good luck, highly recommend him!"
"Malik, Amita","Prof Malik was fantastic for the first 3/4 of my Calc II course. When we got to sequences and series she confused herself and the class a few times and I went on youtube to supplement the material she taught us. Overall, she really cares about her students and I would definitely take again. | Overall, Ms. Malik is a really great professor. She knows her concepts very well, and in turn explains them well too, through the use of in-depth proofs. During class, she encourages inquisition and is always happy to answer questions inside and outside the classroom, and is often accessible through email. All in all, I enjoyed attending class. | Calc 2 is already difficult, but Prof. Malik's teaching style doesn't make it any easier. She seems like a smart and nice person, but she doesn't seem to have a conplete grasp on teaching. Her explanations are much more complicated than they need to be. She makes a lot of mistakes when writing on the board, which can make things more confusing. | DO NOT take calc II with Amita Malik. I have never met a professor more incompetent of teaching students. Her lectures are extremely confusing, her exams are extremely difficult in comparison to the examples done in class and the homework assigned. She spends a majority of class time correcting her mistakes since she doesn't prep prior to class. | 50% of the class is her doing useless proofs, 20% is her making mistakes and having to scribble out my notes for the 100th time and 30% of the class is her cramming the important information and examples in the last 5 minutes of the class. | There are two midterm exams and one final. She only curves the second midterm. I did okay in the final but did really bad in the first midterm, so I get a C. There is no curve for the overall final score. It is really hard to get a decent grade. | She seems to believe the uniqueness of mathematical proof. So if your answer is different from what she believes is perfect, you'll get absolutely zero. | Professor Malik is really friendly and when you ask her questions she is really willing to explain to you. However, she is not very good at explaining stuff. She easily confuses herself. She always gives very misleading lectures and ends up misguides everyone. | This is possibly one of the worst professors I've ever seen teach. She comes incredibly unprepared to lectures and when she writes proofs they're sloppy. You take notes on these proofs, use a similar format for the hw and the grader fails you. Also, don't even bother going to her office hours. Very rude. | This professor gives very confusing lectures and she sometimes even could not understand the concepts herself!"
"Kallupalam Balasubram, Moulik","Professor Moulik is passionate and has a lot of knowledge to share. His smile is contagious and he truly cares about all of his students. He makes sure to explain everything clearly and make very hard concepts and proofs seem easy. | He was frequently available to meet outside class to review the material. He met with me after exams to discuss exam questions, and when I had to miss an exam due to illness, he was very accommodating regarding setting up a later exam date. | Very boring class | Great lectures | he explained concepts well and provided all resources needed to learn, was always friendly and wanted all of his students to succeed and do well. he was always willing to answer questions and was normally available at office hours. i think most of the poor ratings come from how calc 135 in general is structured at rutgers | Math 481 is an extremely difficult course, but the professor was able to teach it in a clear and effective manner. You have to come to class to do well, but he is good with answering questions and explaining topics. Somewhat of a harsh grader but overall a good professor. | Better simple avoid or risk failing or getting low grade. He just give zero points even if answer is wrong but steps are done. 21/6 is graded zero if you dont simply to 7/2. So pathetic. Take his classes at your risk. He will set mid term exam to make you loose confidence in math for sure. | He had dry humor throughout the semester which was pretty funny. He assigns homework at a good time and would extend it if he has not gone over the topic yet in class. I found him amazing. Typically for a lecture, he'd go through definitions and then make us work through many problems. It showed me how to approach problems so that I have reference. | One of the best math professors I had at Rutgers. If you go to lectures, you will do fine. But if you have to miss the lecture, just go to his office hours and he will explain everything clearly and one on one. Very friendly and helpful! | Great at explaining new concepts in simple ways. Very open and happy to answer questions during lectures. Easily accessible outside of class. Exams and quizzes are straightforward. Creates warm and comfortable lecture environment. Workload is very manageable. Understanding with personal issues. Material is practical and easy to understand. | Good professor with clear lec | Good lectures, available during office hours, clear with expectations for quizzes and exams | DON'T TAKE IT IF YOU DON'T LIKE TOO MUCH MATH CALCULATIONS WITH YOUR BRAIN! Also don't take it if you hated linear algebra ! Going to class helps but if you skip one or two classes its very difficult to catch up. learning on your own is very difficult if you choose that! Hard midterm 2 and final! quizzes are weighted more then homework :( | The entire class structure is very disorganized, the textbook is awful and extremely difficult to learn from. Going to class helps but if you skip one or two classes its very difficult to catch up. There aren't a lot of online resources for this class compared to a class like Calculus, so learning on your own is very difficult. | I don't understand why he has such a low rating. People find it difficult because calc 135 is a prerequisite for a lot of major but honestly if you go to lecture and review before midterms you should be fine. I attended every lecture did the homework and studied either the day of or the day before the tests and I finished with a B+. | Good professor. Show up to lecture and you will learn enough to pass the class. | Professor Moulik was very kind and funny during his lectures. Calculus at Rutgers is very heavily ""by the book"" since it has a coordinator (Dr. G). He was very resourceful and had office hours everyday. I was thankful to have him. | He was a wonderful professor. He cares about each and every single one of his students and will answer any questions with patience and understanding. He also has office hours every day, which I recommend taking advantage of. Getting a good grade is very manageable as long as you're willing to do practice problems and put in the effort. | If you show up to lecture you will receive a C, if you take time out of your day and learn the material you will get a B, and if you do all the problems he tells you to do, you'll get an A. Calc I is hard in general, but if you put in the work you should be good. Hard to understand sometimes but if you go to office hours he is much clearer. | This Professor is awful, if you take this course with him most of your time will consist of getting prepared for quizzes which are pretty annoying halfway through the semester if you have labs for other classes. The way he sets up his homework is very disorganized. He gives very little partial credit too. | Calc 135 is a challenging class, sometimes he is slightly hard to understand, but for the most part, I found his lectures helpful. | Disorganized and makes lots of mistakes | I think calc is really based on the Doctor G's worksheet... Prof itself doesn't have problem at all. His lecture is helpful but if you self study it is not hard to get an A. | Overall Calc 135 is a poorly designed curriculum. Prof. B is good at explaining math in lectures and reaches out to students struggling. Overall very nice and helpful guy. Don't expect to pass this class without going to lectures and doing the extra work he suggests if you've never taken a calc class before. Good teacher, hard class. | Show up to lectures and you'll be fine. Gives out worksheets to do during class and gives the answers most of the time, counts for free points on your grade. Good at explaining concepts, example problems that he does during lectures are the same as on the exams and quizzes. No homework aside from the 5 MATLAB assignments which are easy. | Disorganized, like you need to do a scavenger hunt on canvas. He is nice and helpful, but gives a LENGTHY explanation for something that can take 2 seconds. Course material isn't too difficult, except when he tests you on something random not in lecture. I got an A and did put effort into the class, but def a tradeoff between headaches and grade. | Honestly one of the best professors I've had. Sometimes lectures were unclear, but was very open to answering questions during class & office hours. Everything on the exam is in his lectures; very straightforward exams. Lots of easy mini quizzes for extra points and practice. Recitation was enough to do well on quizzes and review material. | His notes and explanations are pretty disorganized and confusing and all over the place. The recitations with the TA helped a lot. His exam questions are similar to the quiz questions so they're not too difficult. He had post-exam meetings for some reason which were pretty pointless which are supposed to test you on the exam material. | had him for online calc 5. he was super chill, has a really good system for notes and recorded lectures. format of his canvas page is confusing and he was a bit disorganized sometimes but i felt he taught pretty well and reviewing the material made his exams super easy. make sure you understand the in class examples and any other examples provided. | Just do the WebAssign and textbook problems. The exams are ripped straight from there. | He's a good teacher. Has a bit of an accent, but it was easy to get used to. There were 5 quizzes and one final. Workshops are annoying because you need to do group work virtually. There are mandatory prelecture videos you watch, but they help you understand the material. Poll questions in lectures that count for participation but not correctness. | Grading and requirements are wack. | He's a pretty nice guy. The class is pretty tough to keep up with. If you take his MATLAB section make sure to keep up with the suggested homework problems. The quizzes are pretty tough, but he tells you in advance so just review before them. The exams are similar to practice exams. Very generous curve in the end which made my 79% average a B+. | Really really tough grader, maybe he or the TA Zhuolun Yang give the grade. They will never see your hard-working! Skipping this class, if you don't want to get an F!!! No partial credits, if your final answer is not exactly the same as his answer or the definition of the textbook, you will lose all points of the question. Smile does not mean kind. | Boring lectures. Difficult to understand him. | Uses a textbook that isn't even written by mathematicians. The whole class is a repetition of tedious exercises which don't require understanding but non-stop row operations. This course felt more like a course for non-majors than an upper level math class. | Moulik was an amazing professor to learn Lin Ops. He was an excellent lecturer and had an answer to every question that was asked of him. He goes in a pace where everyone feels comfortable, has fair game quizzes and exams, and is open for office hours at late nights. Only slight drawback is that the homework is a bit hard. Good luck with him! | He was poorly prepared and it took him weeks to grade out quizzes. | Tough grader and not organized, always ask you stupid questions and need to give brief explanations in exams | He really does seem to care that his students do well in the class. He always answers any questions asked, no matter how basic. To get a good grade in this class, make sure you go to every lecture, and understand the material as its being taught instead of right before the exam, I never went to a single office hour, but still was able to get an A. | He is a very good professor, he explains well at lecture and is very patient with you at office hours when you don't understand the material. I took Calc 3 with another professor before and it didn't go well, with prof Moulik I was able to grasp more of the subject. Try to go to his office hours, if you can't make it he finds a time that suits you. | His lectures aren't well organized. He tries to make the material interesting but it would be better if he had more structure. | I have missed a couple lectures, and that is what really pushed me behind. If you miss a lecture, be prepared to quickly catch up or you never will. He is a good professor, it is just his teaching method of using a notebook did not prove beneficial. Just go to lecture, and put in your own time studying and you will pass. | Calc is difficult no matter who you have, especially if you haven' taken calc in high school like I didn't. I showed up to every lecture, did a few practice problems from the textbook, went to office hours and did practice exams. I missed a B by a slim margin. Tests were fair and professor was very helpful if you put in effort and went to off hour | Probably not the best professor, but definitely not the worst either. His lectures are pretty dull and he is a bit unorganized, but if you take good notes and put in time studying/doing homework outside of class, you should be able to do well. | Strict grader, class is very hard, but nice professor and respected. Not much room for negotiation. | If possible, switch out immediately from his class especially if you have a heavy course load. He starts out slow but ends up needing to rush through everything in the end. Doing the homework problems does little to help on the two exams because his problems are not from the textbook. If you can't switch out do your best to get help early on. | If you get Moulik for calc 135 switch out as soon as possible. His lectures are useless they are just unorganized examples. If you want to pass you have to teach yourself everything. His midterms are much harder than all other profs and hes just not helpful honestly save urself | anyone that didn't like this professor, most likely did not go to lecture often. I went to all his lectures, and he explained everything well, answered everyone's questions, and his exams were not hard but you just have to study and practice a lot . Other than that, he was probably my favorite professor this semester. | He's a good guy and has a clear passion for his job. His teaching style isn't the best though. Taking notes in his class is useless because I never looked back at them since I was too busy trying to teach myself. He starts off with a slow pace and gradually picks up and it gets impossible to catch up. His tests are hard. Wouldn't recommend him. | Moulik cares about teaching and answers all questions well. He made the class very enjoyable. Definitely recommend taking him! | His teaching style might not be the greatest, but all of the assignments and assessments are more than do-able. His exams are not that tough, just need to keep up with the homeworks and quizzes, and practice a lot before the exam and you'll be fine. | Good lectures, he explained things really well. The exams were straight forward and like problems you'd find on the homework. Only complaint was that we went pretty slow at the beginning, and although that was great at first, we ran out of time at the end and had to cram three of the most important theorums of the class into one lecture. | This guy is predictable. He gives out homework once a week except after exams. He also has quizzes which he announces two or more days in advance. He has no attendance, but he doesn't post lecture notes online so you should go to class. He's a pretty good and lighthearted lecturer. However, he doesn't give extra credit, so you have to work. | Not a good professor at all. He isn't good at explaining concepts in class or during office hours. It didn't help that his TA (Semonsen) was equally bad. His webassign problems are ten times harder than what he does in class, and they don't have practice another version. Those problems will take you hours unless your friend has chegg. | Skipped almost every class. He is not exactly the best lecturer and you have to be very self-sufficient to do well. Quizzes every week and a large amount of problem sets. | Emailed him the last day for help with my grade and its been 3 months since the semester ended but still no response. By far one of the worst professors Ive had throughout college in terms of caring about the students of understanding what position theyre in. | Decent lecturer, goes fairly slow in explaining what he does in many things including proofs. Can be a bit messy and spent most of the semester catching up as he fell behind his schedule. Understand and do the HW Available and helpful outside of class. His exams were alright but the final was a lot longer than usual. 4 people finished on time | Had him for Linear Opt. He started many lectures with a plan (I.e we will cover topic a and topic b), but half the time there wasnt time for topic b. So its just kept getting pushed to next lecture. Eventually we ended up being so behind that we rushed the last chapter. Class isnt very procedural, but knowing theory helps. Exams were long. | Gives pop quizzes for attendance. Takes too much time to grade everything. Exams are pretty easy though. | This class gave me so many migraines. You can't really listen to what he has to say during lectures because you're writing til the end of class. Pop quizzes suck, tests are made by Satan, and he was just god awful. The only saving grace was that he did curve the final grade. | Takes a really long time to grade exams (including the final). He also will give you homework that takes HOURS and then post confusing and messy solutions to them. Doesn't release averages for exams so you don't know where you stand in the class or if there's a curve whatsoever. His lectures are not bad in my opinion, but he doesn't follow the book | Avoid this Prof if you can. He is a terrible teacher and a hard grader. He seems really nice the first day, but don't be fooled. The subject is pretty easy, so if you can take any other prof, do so. If you can wait a semester before taking this class to avoid this prof, I would recommend that. | The lecture is terrible and the hand writing is hard to read. He gives popquizes for attendance and homework every week. Exam is hard, cumulative and hes also a tough grader. Wont take his class again. | Read the book. He doesn't have any structure regarding the presentation of the material. | Nice guy but there was a huge discrepancy between what we did in class vs what was on the exams. Lectures moved slow for the beginning, then started going insanely fast once we hit multiple integration all the way to the end. Overall it wasn't the worst class, but he made it harder than it could have been. | He follows the book so it's easy to catch up if you miss a class. His TA is absolutely terrible and knows nothing about the subject. | This professor is very bad at explaining the concepts, which forces you to memorize formulas and pray. His notes are all over the place. Even if you use every online resource to memorize everything you're still screwed because his exams are hard as hell and he will ask obscure theory related questions. Stay away from this guy at all costs. | Expects you to know theory but is really terrible at explaining theory. Hard grader and takes off points for pretty much anything. Use y1,y2 instead of x1,x2? Half credit off. Homeworks take forever and rarely involve's what he does in class. Doesn't do many examples that are similar to exam questions. | Speak unclear, and a very tough grader. Choose someone else."
"Shtelen, Vladimir","Shtelen is very matter-of-fact but seems like he has a more fun side to him. Lectures were to the point, although boring at times. Go to recitation or at least take the workshops as they are difficult problems that will prepare you for the exams. He gives a nice equation sheet on the final that is very useful, and he gives lots of partial credit. | Honestly just a good guy. He said he's willing to weight the midterm less for people that bombed it so long as they do better on future exams | Great Professor. He puts a reasonable grading scale change, gives opportunities to students to succussed through recitation quizzes, workshops, and hw. Exams are difficult, but he also changes the grading scale based on the class average. If you pay attention in lecture and put in the effort you will succeed. | Very passionate about math and willing to help others if asked. Lectures are heavy on theory and proofs, so practice problems are left to the individual. | He is a great professor, he went over multiple example problems in class, which helped you understand what is going on, His midterms were hard, especially the first one, because it was nothing like the practice, it was more conceptual, but the second one was fairly easier.Overall, he teaches pretty well, but a lot of practice also has to be done. | The TA Daniel was very nice, every quiz was a breeze, and I would take it again. | Take at your own peril | Shtelen is a kind professor, he wants his students to pass and he is really passionate about math. | His lectures are really boring and his exams are a bit hard so you should just thug it out and pay attention. He's very monotonous so it's tiring. | Shtelen is a great professor. He doesn't use a powerpoint because he knows everything at the top of his head. If you go to his lectures and study the material, you will do great in his class. Stay on top of your assignments, he grades the midterms fairly. You get what you deserve, its as simple as that. Go to his office hours because he is helpful. | Shtelen makes the challenging material engaging. Attend class, use the free textbook, and try Unstuck AI - it really helped with study prep. Overall a fair professor who cares about student learning. | Difficult class talks kind of quiet | Shtelen's lectures focus too much on theory and not enough on examples for my taste, I often felt lost. He's good at answering questions after lecture, he's passionate about the subject, and the curve goes crazy. My friend got an 18% on the final and still got a C. | Prof Shtelen is a really nice man. He explains topics thoroughly and is always open to questions. He is pretty quiet so sitting near the front is necessary. His quietness can make it easy to lose track of the lecture so be sure to stay locked-in! | Professor Shtelen is a cute old man. He's very soft spoken so you have to sit in the front if you want to pay attention. Most of his lectures are helpful with explanation of the topic. He does proofs for some things which are irrelevant in my opinion. His workshops are harder than other professors, but it prepares you better for the final. | I had Shtelen for Calc II and III. His lectures are pretty good, he does problems at a good pace. He is very soft-spoken so I would recommend sitting toward the front. The way he assigned homework was that every section would have homework due at the end of semesters, STAY ON TOP OF THESE unless you wanna be doing 15 assignments during finals. | Gave me a 0 on an exam I was excused from, then refused to accept an assignment I submitted or any regrades I requested. Tests were unreasonably hard in what should have been an easy class. Take other calculus teachers who put in more effort to teaching their students and making fair exams. | Good but quiet lecturer, you'll definitely want to sit in the front of class. All of exams and assignments are reasonable with the major exception of his finals, in which the class average will drop 30+ points. Besides that it is hard to complain. | I really enjoyed this class with Shtelen. You could really tell how much he enjoyed the material and math in general. Shtelen hints at what will be on exams and is really fair with grading; he will give points back if you have a fair point. I would recommend sitting at the front, as he's a little quiet. | This is a hard course, and Shtelen made it enjoyable. He is incredibly smart. He comes into class, smiles, gives a quick hello, starts writing on the board, and teaches without any notes. When he smiles after doing a long problem, you just can't help but also feel happy and love math. He explains the material and answers questions well. Great man. | I HIGHLY recommend going in and sitting at the front of the class. He made a lot of topics clear for me, told us exactly what to expect on quizzes and exams (consisted of conceptual + T/F), and graded quickly (the TA was kinda slow). If you think he took a lot of points off when grading, plead your case and he does give it back. | While attending his 8:30am lectures was boring, Shtelen is a super fair professor. Do NOT skip this guy's class: Not only does he teach fairly well, but he will tell you exactly what will be on his quizzes and exams. He also barely gives any homework. As long as you do textbook problems and go to lectures (really, don't skip) you will be just fine. | He's interesting. Really loves the material and is sorta effective at answering questions. Final was basically awful, but Shtelen doesn't make it. | I really enjoyed this class with Shtelen. Yes, he's a little quiet, but he's a great lecturer. He taught very clearly with structure that made the concepts easy to follow. He used a lot of proofs in this class for concepts, which can be lengthy, but made the concepts stick in my head better. He also uses examples often, which is nice. | He tries to be a good professor, I'll give him that, but the online exams were ridiculous and we barely had time to complete anything. The material is really challenging too and I wish that they better prepared us for the exams and final. Do not recommend. | Overall pretty good professor for math 251. Taught the material pretty well, responded to questions effectively during lecture, and the exams arent TOO bad. Just a little old and had some trouble with the tech of online class | None of the assignments were posted on canvas hard to follow and 90 questions before an exam | took him last semester: absolute garbage teacher, not ready to do this online, everyone absolute despises him. super slow at grading, lectures, and replying to emails. needs to retire, since nobody attends his 2 hour lectures anyways and just learns from 20 minute videos on youtube. DO NOT TAKE HIM LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN. | Great professor, learned a lot and the curve was nice! | I took him for calc 251 over remote learning due to the pandemic and i can tell you that he is not ready to be teaching online, the lectures are slow and he does not explain anything at all and does not make connections between topics. I learned more off of youtube then i did from him. I would not recommend taking him. | DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN YOUVE BEEN WARNED | Shtelen's multivar calc was my 1st class on the 1st day of my freshman year. Most memorable for quietly conveying his passion for math in thorough lectures, willing to stay with me well after class to discuss hw problems in the hallway. Set high expectations for college profs. 2 easier midterms, harder final. Sit in front if you want to hear him. | His exams are extremely difficult,but he gives a huge curve at the end of the semester. I failed midterm 1 and a C+ on midterm 2 and bombed the final but ended with a B+. HW is based upon who your ta is but the suggested problems definitely help. | His exams were so hard especially the final. He didn't prepare us enough for the exam and was a bit unclear and hard to hear during all lectures | He is very quiet. Sit front row. He is not very hard and helpful in office hours. | Easy, boring, slow pace and quiet lectures. Exams are very similar to the examples he does in class. | He is a really good professor. He explains the concepts really well/ I just wish he spoke louder during the class, it was hard to hear him at times. | He is very knowledgeable and goes over many helpful example problems in lecture. Although he has an accent, it is pretty easy to understand. His exams are also pretty reasonable; as long as you do the homework problems you should be prepared. He is also very willing to help outside of class if you have any questions. | Took his intro to linear algebra class and it overall wasn't bad! Nice guy and his lectures are decent. Tests are fair, if you think he took off too many points for something go plead your case and he'll probably give some points back! Doesn't check homework but do them if you wanna do well! | I think Shtelen is underrated as a professor. He isn't the best i have ever had but he is a solid teacher and wants his students to do well. | Not a bad guy and knows his stuff but as a professor, NO. He grades really hard, a small mistake can cost you more than half the points. His lectures have a lot of proofs which are irrelevant on homework and exams. When you ask him questions he can be really unclear and sometimes unhelpful. | very kind and helpful man. speaks softly so sit in the front. But you have to basically learn all the material on your own. Study the textbook, do all the homework problems multiple times. Easy B harder A. two quizzes, two midterms and a final. Take this class with him because he is one of the few profs who doesn't give proofs on exams. | Makes Calc 244 a nightmare compared to other professors. Class has a decent curve, but the exam material is gruesome. Puts a lot of hard calc 2 integrals on his exam, and some gruesome algebra; so prepare intensively besides just the calc 4 material. Otherwise, he is a kind guy who has some pretty good lectures. | Very good professor. Quizes are fair and so are exams. Voice little soft so sit near the front. But he's nice guy. Go to his office hours for any help and hes very helpful | He is absolutely horrible for math 152. He doesn't prepare you for the exam at all. It's better to read the book or go to omeone else's lectures. | Gives easy exams but the final from the department was harder. Doesn't prepare you well. | Good professor for linear algebra. 2 quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. Quizzes and exams are similar to what he does in class and the homework problems. He's very clear about what the exams cover. Homework optional, but if you're good on the homework, you'll be set for the exams. Very friendly guy. | He is a horrible professor. He doesn't teach you anything. He spends so much time doing proofs even though we're not tested on that. He also just talks to himself the entire lecture. His exams are easy compared to other professors but everyone is so unprepared for the exam it doesn't make a difference. You have to teach yourself EVERYTHING. | Reading the textbook is optional, but his lectures are straight out of the book. He is not very good at answering questions and speaks very quietly. If a religious exemption is needed, talk to workshop TA. He is not the best at answering emails. He does prepare you for the exams that he gives, but it is a very homework heavy class (web-assign). | Doesn't teach you proofs and you have to memorize a lot. | I thought he was a pretty solid teacher tbh. I felt his tests were fair, his grading was fair, his lectures were well paced, that he had a complete understanding of the material, and that he was effective in conveying the structure and contents of that material to the class. Hope to get him again for differential equations. | He writes theorems on the board, doesn't prove them, then solves some problems. There is no explanation why this theorems are true, at least intuitively. Wish he did more explanations. Nice handwriting. | Speaks very softly and is an extremely kind professor, accent isn't impossible to understand. Exams are straightforward as in he literally tells you what to expect. | He teachers 80 percent theory, 20 percent examples. Wish he did more examples and I wish he had an online sakai page for the course. The TA was absolutely exceptional; however, he was a really harsh grader. Schtelen is an easy grader. Do the HW and you should be fine for exam. 50+ was C, 85+ was A, in between were other grades. You can also appeal. | Schtelen is a nice professor who is there to help you. Go to his office hours and seek his help. I got a D on first exam, a B on second and idk the final but probably a C to B plus range and ended with B. His curve was great where 50+ was a C for exam 1 and 2. The material is easy just do not fall behind. Some units were much harder than others. | Very straightforward exams. | He is a kind man but his final was all over the place. | Easy if you do your homework. Sit the front row or you won't hear anything. | He speaks very softly and has accent. If you don't sit in the first two rows, might as well not go to lecture. Calc 2 at Rutgers is hard in general so can't really say if he is hard or not. BUT I would not take him again just because he is so quite and I had to learn calc 2 by myself. Got A for midterm and C for final and he gave me C wow. :/ | Boring, doesn't use Sakai properly. Good luck if you have this guy. | Very boring, doesn't use Sakai properly. Good luck if you have this guy. | 3 exams and 3 quizzes; that's it. To be honest, I'd say his tests are fair. They cover everything that's needs to be covered. You learn something new every lecture so missing one puts you behind a lot. Just keep good time management and read thoroughly especially through theorems and you should be fine. Homework are ""suggested"" | Agree with the prior comments regarding his ridiculous teaching of Linear Algebra. Took it this semester to fill an elective slot and I was shocked at how confusing he was able to make this relatively simple material. I took Calc 1-4 (differential equations) and the ECE version of Calc 5 and got straight A's in all of them with no problems. | My biggest mistake at college was to choose this professor. I failed linear algebra with him which is supposed to be the easiest math class. His examples in class are much easier than exams. | Horrible professor. Very confusing and focuses heavily on theorems. Makes linear algebra (a very easy subject) unnecessarily hard by obfuscating the material. Do not take this class with this professor. | You just have to do your work and keep up with the lectures. dont fall behind | Great professor and presenter. His teaching approach is like a mathematical recipe book. Very crystal clear and easy to follow. He makes you work for it, but if you do, you will find it very fun! Plenty of examples. Redo those done in class and quizzes to study for midterms and final. Has a great sense of humor! Take all 3 Vladimirs for Math at RU! | Very hard class, easy to fail. He isnt helpful. Doesnt reply to emails. | Shtelen is very sweet. He really cares about students and wants people to do well. The curve was 80 and above is an A. I actually took him in the fall, but seeing all these negative reviews made me feel obligated to stand up for him. He's a wonderful, kind professor. For exams, the best way to study is to look at class notes and redo examples. | very boring. does not do much to explain concepts and the reasons behind how we get to the answer."
"Tsipenyuk, Natalya","NT is a good TA with a good sense of humor. I never found that she was a tough grader and thought that her explanations were quite through. | Had her as a recitation instructor for Calc 3. There was a huge problem with her explanations and grading as apparently she didn't know the material well herself. We got nearly perfect scores on quizzes because of her grading but then failed miserably the midterm. The professor reviewed our quizzes and there were apparently serious grading mistakes | thick accent, wasn't able to explain concepts very well, and the things taught in class didn't help with the tests that were given in class, or they were just extremely complex | I honestly liked her as a professor. Her male TA however was such harsh grader. But she helped me on some of the midterm questions. Like if i made a silly math error she would correct it and give me the points. All calc sections take the same finals and her midterms are similar so that helps. Do her practice exams. Similar to the midterms. | TA for calc 135. She's a nice woman, but if you have trouble with calc, avoid. Accent makes her difficult to understand, quizzes are very difficult, and she hardly gives partial credit; I would often get 0/10 on her quizzes. The way she tries to explain concepts did not make sense either. If you're not a math person, you should find a different TA. | She was my TA for Calculus I. Very nice woman, but not helpful at all. To be honest, she CONFUSED me on concepts I had known before listening to her! Her quizzes are much harder than the homework assigned, and do not seem very representative of the course. I'd recommend you avoid at all costs unless you're very strong at math. | She is very nice and explains concepts well in recitation. She genuinely cares about students' needs and attempts to deliver content relevant for the main lecturer's exams. | She is a nice lady, but her lectures barely helped me. She gives 2 midterms and 1 final (final is worth most of your grade). I completely bombed the first 2 midterms, studied my ass off for the final and got a B on it leaving me with a B for the class. If you feel like you're struggling in the class just make sure you do well on the final. | She was really confusing because she has a strong accent and it's tough to understand her during lectures. And her tests are way harder than what she goes over in class. But if you put in a lot of individual effort, it's possible to survive with a decent grade. I already took AP calc in high school but it was still a tough class for me. | She's nice and seems likes she wants to help you, but she really doesn't. Isn't clear at all in lectures and often makes many simple algebra mistakes. Her lectures have nothing to do with tests, quizzes, or homework. Also, she's a very tough grader and barely gives partial credit. Screws many students over with grades and doesn't curve anything | She is a nice teacher but she will not stand up for her students. She knows the material but she cant teach it for her life. She teaches in class 2 + 2 and then on the test asks for the derivative of sin(cos(tan(x))). if i had the choice i will never take her again in my life. AVOID THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! | Nice person... My grade s B+ and I havn't gone to most lectu. Just try | My advisor told me I should beware teachers who give only two huge tests, and she was right. Don't take her to save your life! Her tests compose of the hardest possible questions from cumulative chapters and it's only around eleven questions in total! She cannot explain anything in English very well either. | Easy class. Professor wasn't too clear sometimes but for the most part her notes helped for her exams and final. Really unnecessary to go to the lectures. | Very nice teacher, but tough to understand and only goes over basic problems in class. Tests are pretty difficult, and learning concepts through the book/online videos are the best way to prepare. Attendance is pointless after a while because she goes through problems so quickly but she does curve tests if a lot of people fail (which many do) | If you attend every lecture and paid attention fully, you should be able to do well in the class. In general, she isn't the clearest with her explanations and her accent doesn't help. Her exams are one of the hardest for the department but the final exam is a breeze in comparison. Study hard, like every class, and you should do fine. | Don't get me wrong, she's nice and everything, but...The stuff she'll tell you in class, and the stuff that shows up on her exams are two completely different things. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. | Had taken AP Calc & still withdrew from this course. Nice lady, but I couldn't understand what she was saying during lecture due to her accent as well as her questionable handwriting. Being nearly 100% familiar w the content up to the 1st exam according to the textbook & her lectures, the exam itself did not correspond & I got a D. Don't take her! | OMG! She is so hard. The only reason I managed a B in this class is because the curve was like 15 points because everyone was failing. Her lectures don't have anything to do with her tests, but I was very prepared for the final (none of her doing- I read the book) Don't take her. She is very nice. I went to office hours-doesn't help but was nice. | A couple of her lectures were confusing, but for most of them I was able to follow what she was saying. If you solve the practice/old exams and watch the review video (posted online on the calc website) until you understand each problem, you should be fine when you take the exams. The textbook isn't necessary if you attend lectures and recitations | She focuses more on conceptual than straightforward questions. Her class requires a lot of effort and work. She's sweet but difficult to understand. Although her exams were hard, I felt well-prepared for the final and thought it was easy. You need to study her notes, the textbook, old exams and possibly online videos. That's how I got an A. | The exams during the course were hard, but she prepared really well for the final exam. | She is a nice person, but that's all. I feel like I've been left out to dry because the material she teaches is completely irrelevant when it comes to the homework, tests, or quizzes. The textbook is good but it can often be confusing since it makes some things way too complicated. | She is a kind lady who truely believes her students understand what she is saying. However, her exams are brutally difficult, not even really on the fundamentals of Calc but more of minor tricky tidbits that are technically considered calculus. Stay clear from her class, and calc will not be hard since other profs do not have her heartless approach | I'm extremely upset with this course. Tests are too abstract to what she is teaching, and this is not a high level calc course. It's for students that do not have a high interest in continuing the class, but need the basics for their major. Do not take this class. | Probably the hardest calc teacher ever. Has no clue how to teach and exams are ridiculous. If you have her CHANGE your class. Its not worth the effort at all. Like not matter how hard you try you probably will still fail. | Exams are ridiculous. Has no real understanding of how well students have learned the material. Expects a lot after giving only a little. | When are you adding in your courses and your schedule seems perfect, if you see her name, change it. Change EVERYTHING if you have to. Your good schedule is not worth having her. | Disappointing. Didn't learn any calculus from this teacher. Don't recommend her as a teacher. The exams are different from what she teaches. | Don't recommend this teacher. The exams are different from what she teaches in the class. No Practice Exams. Didn't learn any calculus from her. Disappointed. | I don't recommend this professor. If you have this teacher study by the book.You are not going to learn calculus from her.What she teaches in class is different than what is on the tests. She doesn't review the material before exams.There are no practice exams. Very disappointed about this class. | I wouldn't recommend this professor. She is sweet, but it is about understanding and you will not understand her at all. Tests are ridiculous hard and nothing like class. | She is really sweet but her class makes no sense when it comes to the test. USE THE BOOK. Do all of the suggested problems and DO NOT rely on her lecture notes. | Like what she teaches in class is way different than what is on her tests, one question on the test we didn't even learn! Basically if you have this teacher just study by the book, you can't even hear what she's saying and the test is nothing what the other calc teachers have prepared. | If you have this teacher, study by the BOOK! Her exams are hard and you really need to know the materials. She also have a strong accent that makes me hard to understand."
"Echeverria Echeverria, Mariano","Professor Echeverria is a great multivariable teacher. Sometimes he goes heavy on the conceptual side of things, but it is all useful. He is a forgiving grader and is attentive towards his students. If you ever have questions, don't be scared to go to office hours; he's very nice! | Overall, he was a very good professor and taught the course material well. | Literally the only reason I passed Multivariable Calc was because of Mariano. I love this man. He really puts effort into his lectures and usually posts his slides online if you miss a class. | He is such a great professor, I recommend him for multicalc. His exams are hard, but it's multicalc so that is expected. His resources are great and his lectures are helpful. He's a very easy to talk to professor who is ready to answer all questions. He explains the concepts really well he makes sure you KNOW the material. | Prof Echeverria is by far the best calc 3 professor and he actually made the course pretty fun. Try your best to get him | The class was pretty hard, but he posts helpful lectures and videos. Homework and assignments were fair, and he's a really caring and helpful professor. Exams were hard (as was the rest of the department's), I didn't score well on any of them, so the curve likely helped—keep that in mind. | Mariano is a great teacher who made class stress-free. He gave quizzes beforehand, graded workshops on completion, and attendance wasn't required. His fairness and engaging style make him a top professor. While he challenges Hove as the best at Rutgers, Mariano is not quite there—but he's still an excellent professor worth learning from! | This professor was great! The material was challenging to me, and I tried my best. Although I didn't preform very well on the exams, I ended up with a B. I feel like I was rewarded for my hard work. He gives 2 midterms, and a final. The homework is a free 24% of your overall grade. He gives 4 practice exams for each exam. | Very good at conveying the conceptual side of the course, very easy and forgiving grader. Recitation not physically mandatory, but assignments are still due on the day of. Also just as a guy, very goofy. | He's an amazing professor who grades really leniently and will thoroughly explain content during his lectures. | Great lecturer, everything in the class is laid out for you, makes vector calc super fun and interesting. Highly recommend. | I took intermediate algebra with him, and he made it easy to understand the concepts. He was very helpful during quizzes, not a rough grader, and will help you through equations. Homework is simple, and helps if you do the cengage as well. He kept classes short and right to the point, and saves everyone a lot of time. | His lectures are really good and easy to follow, but the homework sometimes is much harder than the examples he shows in lectures. If you're taking multicalc TAKE HIM, he's incredible. Sure, his exams can be tricky, they tend to lean towards conceptual problems, but if you pay attention in lecture and put effort in, you'll be fine. | The best calc 3 professor by far. Teaches well, very engaging and supportive, but the class is still rather difficult as you should expect. The exams are more difficult than the provided practice exams so make sure you keep up with your assignments (it only gets harder). Could not recommend a better calc 3 professor! | He is super nice and will explain all problems carefully! He loves to answer questions and is super patient with teaching everyone! He posts all his notes and has lecture videos you can watch even if you can't attend lecture (but you should because he is amazing!). Best professor I've ever had. | I love this guy he is the goat. | The undisputed goat. Amazing lectures and everything was posted on his YouTube channel. Wish he had gone more in depth with some topics, but he taught everything very well. Exams are not too bad if you pay attention. If you have the chance to take him do it. | Mariano is a very easygoing professor and lineant grader. He records all his lectures and he is a very nice guy. I wish he had gone a little more in-depth into why everything worked. He mostly just taught us how to do the computations. Overall very nice and effective professor. I recomend. | Just go over the practice exams over and over til you memorize the steps. That way you will be prepared to take the exams that he has. Has true and false sections so do know some concepts. Overall, a nice professor, he does care about his students and wants people to succeed. | Amazing math professor. Especially for Multivariable the way he explained lectures helped me visualize all the concepts which is key in Multivariable. Great professor. Very accessible outside of class. Just a note, the later portion of Multivariable is difficult and the final will be harder than the previous two midterms. Be prepared for that. | The absolute goat. Took me from hating math to it being my favorite subject. Explained everything super well (borderline failed BC in HS but now I feel like I understand everything) and was very accommodating of my medical conditions. Homework is light if you take chunks out at a time. | Lectures are good. Quizzes are easy. Assigns videos on advanced theorems for extra quiz marks. Workshops aim to check attendance. Homework is little. It takes little time to study his course. But he is a tough grader: average of the final (a little harder than workshop) is 60%. Besides, 2nd midterm is much harder than workshop, the average is 60%. | The best professor I've had at Rutgers. Teaches the concepts very well and gives you an in depth understanding of the materials. Responds to emails very fast, answers questions in class even faster, and has office hours quite frequently during the week. I could not recommend a better professor to learn calc 3 from. | Very bad when it came to helping people pass. No clear answers to hard questions, homework was pushed back so many times, just in general not a desirable teacher. | Echeverria is a great guy and a great teacher. I failed because I treated my first semester of college like I did high school, aka not studying and not asking for help. There is a preset quota of As, Bs, etc, so the kind. grading ends up not mattering and the curve is basically nonexistent. Go to class and practice and ask for help when you need it | Professor Echeverria was very nice and his quizzes were super easy if you did the homework problems he suggests. But the class itself (the exams) is very hard, and he oftentimes dumped on us a lot of homework problems not even taught in class. It's not his fault though because there's not enough time in class. Class is heavily weighted on exams. | While I didn't attend lectures often because of the wealth of information online the interactions I've had with Mariano have been exceptionally helpful (very uncharacteristic for a rutgers staff member) and he has always been reachable. Calc 3 is hard no matter who you take, but he's caring and genuinely wants you to pass. Strongly recommend. | His lectures are not mandatory but recommend going as math 251 is a tough subject and he is good at explaining the concepts using real life examples. Extra help, he's awesome with it. Error on your exam score, he's always willing to fix it and give credit back. Quizzes have extra credit as well. 5/5 experience with him. Cares about his students. | such a caring professor, if you need a due date pushed back for hw, he will gladly do it for you. The class is pretty rigorous but he makes it so manageable | So nice, so understanding, and explains the concepts REALLY well. I had him Fall 2022 and his homework policy was really nice (75%+ = 100% on the MyLab homeworks). He's eager to help and does not mind going over things he already explained. 11/10 | He's one of my favorite teachers ever. He's super funny and his lectures are very clear on the topics. I definitely recommend taking notes from the textbook as well since Calc III is generally a hard topic so it helps to reinforce the material. I highly recommend Echeverria. He's young, tech-saavy, hilarious, and super smart. HW wasn't bad either. | Amazing professor. Keeps the lectures fairly fun (as fun as multi can be). Recommends videos for all different subjects, and has his own videos for each new concept. Every time I emailed him he responded within a few minutes. | Professor Echeverria is one of the best Professors I've had at Rutgers! His lectures are great and quite fun, and help you understand the course material in great depth. He is also very caring and understanding. Overall, I really enjoyed Professor Echeverria's class! | Mariano is the best professor out of 251. Thank god he's the coordinator too. He has so many resources from making his own youtube videos, his recorded lecture videos, and other notes/problems just in case. He also always asks in lecture if people understand and is easy to reach outside class. Made Calc 3 so much more bearable | Good prof. Did lectures and made videos on the topics. I never went to lectures and just watched the videos and did fine. | He genuinely cares about students learning, and always offered to hold extra office hours especially around exam time. His homework and quizzes are extremely fair. Only complaint is lectures tend to not be productive as too much time is spent going over the basic general idea of topics and not enough examples or difficult problems are shown. | Took 251H with Mariano during the online semester. He's super flexible with due dates and will push back homework assignments if you ask. He's really friendly and his grading is clutch. In lecture, he doesn't really do too many example problems (maybe 1 or 2 simple ones) so be prepared to teach yourself how to do the homework/exam review problems. | Mariano is fantastic. 251H is a hard class but he really knows his stuff and he makes class fun and engaging. I cannot recommend him enough. | Mariano was the best. So funny, obviously cared about his students, and taught the material really well | Really outstanding guy. Had him during corona and he was available for like 7 hours total a week, really awesome! Very understanding and gives fair exams. If you are taking 251 honors please do yourself a favor and take Mariano. | You don't have to attend class on time or at all, but Multivariable Calc gets tough towards the end, so make sure you're on top of your material if you're going to skip. | Mariano is amazing, he gives super clear lectures & really understands the material of Multivariable Calc beyond what he teaches so can answer questions really well. His tests are fair and he is willing to curve them when necessary (usually not). If you do the homework and understand the material you'll get an A. | The best | He's a really nice guy but his lectures are very slow placed and he doesn't really explain the theories well. It's a bit boring and to really grasp the material, you need to learn about it out of class. He's very nice guy and helpful at office hours though. | Available outside of class. | Easygoing professor, always willing to help students with questions about the material or grading."
"Balaban, Tadeusz","The class was definitely harder than I'd expected. I usually couldn't understand much during the lecture. I don't know why I'm typing this as he's no longer at Rutgers. | He is an understanding professor and did curve the class. Lectures were more focused on the proofs and theorems as opposed to examples, which students were tested on. | He is difficult to rate. I had his lecture early in the morning and could not really understand himhe'd lull me to sleep. He graded toughly and although he seems easy, you must know exactly what he wants. The average for our exam 1 and 2 was very low. He curves and is understanding,but you still gotta study HARD, which people here haven't rly said | Easiest professor around. Teaches you for a test. I learned nothing. | Best Professor hands down. Extremely helpful and wants you to get an A. Exam are extremely straightforward and you will excuse you from the final if you average an A. Nicest math Professor as well. | Best teacher ever! He is the nicest professor ever and will honestly help you if you need anything. exempts you from the final if you average an A and he gives straightforward exams | He is the nicest professor. Not a stressful class due to his teaching style. The material can get difficult but he tells u what to expect and what not to. Tests are easy enough to get a C at least. You can easily get an A if you understand the theoretical concepts. He lets you know everything. No surprises, no stress. Loved him! | Definitely take Calc 4 with him! Gave very clear examples in class, and quizzes and tests were always very close to the homework problems assigned. If you go to class and do all of the homework the class is not bad at all | This man is brilliant! So smart and a pleasure to be around. I learned so much from him. He makes math enjoyable and fun. Simply the best! | Very boring lecturer, but extremely easy exams. | he is very easy, open note tests. boring, hard to pay attention though. | Maybe he is good for applied courses, but he is horrible for 311. He doesn't teach you how to prove anything, and the class ends up just being a rehash of calc I and II. The exams are easier than other sections (but still not as ""simple"" as he says), but it's just a real waste of time and tuition. Not to mention that the book sucks. | i was so bored i couldn't understand anything he was saying!!!!! | What an annoying gnome. Boring teacher but exams are decent. | Good instructor! Explains things and isn't mean for no reason like many of the other math instructors. You should have no problem passing his classes if you follow up w/ the book. | He is sooo cute, but sometimes he is in his own little world at the board. He can be a little boring but really goes over everything slowly. It's easy and you learn stuff. | so boring | Attn math majors: the professor balaban will be teaching the TTh evening section of Math 252 for the Spring 2005 semester. TAKE IT! He rocks! | I love this class, and I love professor balaban (even though he says ""eh"" after every single word he says!) | A very good professor. Good exams and quizzes, and fair grading. Recommended! | Balaban is one of the best professor for Differential Equation. He is very fair in his exams. So far I have given first exam and was fairly simple. I hope he continues the same in future. | This class is truly a godsend. Many of my peers, including myself, are suffering thru Math 300 and taking this class too. However this class is entirely unlike 300 in that learning is promoted and is not stressful at all. So, moral of the story, Balaban rocks, take any class w/ him. | The Balaban is the nicest prof at Rutgers. His exams are very fair, OK they're easy, but you'll understand everything. The lectures are a little boring, but helpful. For calc4, he is the best prof (if you get Gundy, drop the class and switch to Balaban...TRUST ME HERE). | he's the cutest old man ever. he explains things pretty clearly without going too fast or oversimplifying. his exams are very, very fair. take this dude for differential equations. | nice guy but horrible instructor. heavy accent and boring lectures, the final for our year was really easy though"
"Sanchez Tapia, Cynthia","Take her if you enjoy learning the theory of what you're learning. Personally, I learn through application so I felt like a deer in headlights constantly in her class and had to teach myself all the material. First midterm is super tough but it gets better after that. | Not the professor for me. Criticized the proof-heavy book for not being rigorous enough. Lectures were convoluted and rote. She almost made the material more difficult to understand by criticizing other sources of learning. She's astoundingly rigid in her principles to a moral fault. Attendance is not required as she wouldn't remember you anyway. | She is very nice and always happy to help. She is very organized as well. There are some topics that she does not explain well, but she is more than willing to clarify. Her exams are somewhat challenging, but not too bad. She is not a bad choice overall. | I had her for Intro to Linear Algebra after Dr. Z left and couldn't teach our section anymore. We were very much behind on the syllabus, not Prof Tapia's fault at all. I think she's a very sweet person and open to questions and she loves it when students want care and want to learn. That being said, I wish Dr. Z the legend hadn't left."
"Walker, Alexander","Very intelligent and nice person, always eager and willing to help, explains things very clearly and methodically. One homework every week which gets easier as the class progresses. Midterms were open note. Final paper, no final exam. Exams are very similar to homework and practice problems. Class is interesting too, take him! | A history of math class should not be that hard. When I search teaching videos on Youtube, teachers give examples of how to change old time notions into modern ones. But what we do is to solve scaring problems. He's a nice guy, but assignments really hard. Even spend time to study, you'll probably not solve these problems! | Very nice guy, and very smart! Always willing to help. Likes to throw fun challenges to make you think. The class is very hard and you will learn a lot as long as you pay attention, make sure you have a solid grasp of number theory/proof writing before taking this. | Amazing prof. Will make you work for it but is super clear, helpful, and you'll actually learn stuff !!! He reminds me of 3blue1brown | The cleverest and hardest teacher in Rutgers. | Great person, tough class. He explains stuff really clearly. If you don't get it you can stop by after class to ask him what you didn't get and he will explain you whole concept again. Other than that you can even email him. | Really enjoyed him as a teacher. You could definitely tell that he was passionate about the material and he made is fairly interesting. That being said, workshops were very difficult and lectures could get boring at times with some skipped steps that made things confusing. Overall a nice and smart guy and you'll do well as long as you do hw and try | Poor lecturer, very monotonous and didnt spark my interests with the topics he taught. Although he is a very smart person, his inexperience showed when he tried teaching the class at lecture. | if you do the homework and not press practice another version on webassign you'll do well on the tests. He's open to questions before and after class. There is one thing is is bad about him. He makes REALLY HARD workshops. I've seen some from other classes and his are way harder. Also out TA told us his other sections dont have ones that hard."
"Retakh, Vladimir","Really nice professor, unfortunately he is on the older side so sometimes it is difficult to hear him in lecture. There would be times where he makes mistakes copying his pre-written notes/examples to the board that would confuse a bunch of use until someone had the courage to speak up and ask, but honestly the class overall wasn't bad at all. | Absolutely terrible at explaining/teaching. Speaks quietly so sit in the front. Very forgiving with late submissions and asking for accommodations(grade changes). Very nice and smart guy. Answers emails quickly. Only problem is with his lectures. Take him if you don't plan to attend lectures. | Prof. Retakh is an okay teacher. If you go to lectures and pay attention you'll probably be fine, but he's not great at explaining the conceptual basis of linear algebra. That said, he is very accommodating of religious exemptions and the like, so that's good. | Such a sweet guy. He has so many little jokes and anecdotes. He made a hard subject seem not too bad. He has a very calm demeanor- recommend! | Really nice professor. Care about his students a lot. Very patience for the question you might have, I love him so much. | I wa surprised to see all the good reviews he was getting since I thought this class was awful. He speaks too softly and his notes are a mess. The class itself was a joke as well, so take this class with him if you want an easy math elective. Exams and quizzes were way too easy, honestly some of those questions were at a precalc level. | Great professor, his exams and quizzes are amazing. I retook Calc 3 so I know how difficult other professors are, and Prof Retakh is the bomb! His TA during my semester sucked though and I heard he doesn't really get back quickly on emails BUT he is very approachable in class. He's pretty quiet so sit up front, if you do, you'll hear his jokes! | A fine example of a professor who really cares about students. Professor Retakh has made a difficult subject like multivariable calculus enjoyable. Quizzes and exams are fair. He also does a helpful review session for the final exam. | Amazing professor! You could tell he really cared about his students passing and understand the material. His lectures were very detailed, and his handwriting was so neat and legible. Attendance was not mandatory but I feel like it was essential to passing. Pay attention in lecture and you're set. | Professor was very good. I showed up late due to scheduling errors and he was able to catch me up to speed. | Overall, Professor Retakh was great! He gave plenty of examples in lecture to prepare us for the exams. He's a Fair grader and Is willing to help. The Final from the department was more difficult than his own exams, but overall he made this class a very enjoyable experience. | He was the course coordinator and responsible for writing the final exam, and his sections did poorly on the final exam. He couldn't prepare them for his own final. My friends from other sections did better. | He speaks very softly. Not very helpful and can't teach. TA's were more helpful than he was. Exams were easy, I got a B+ and an A on them. Final was OK. I would only recommend if you're good at math otherwise you're gonna be frustrated self-teaching yourself because he's terrible at teaching. Do A LOT of practice problems. | After seeing one of the other Math 300 professor, Prof. Retakh is amazing. Sure the class material is difficult, but he goes at an easy pace (compared to other 300 profs), and exams are extremely fair. Definitely recommend this professor. | He is definately a good teacher for a hard class. His lectures are very structured; he writes clearly and organized on the board. I would recommend him, especially for math reasoning. His exams are fair, the class is just really hard. | He is funny when he wants. | Easy class if you ""get"" math (calculus). Kind of like high school calculus but faster. The downsides are his monotone + deep accent (had early class so it put me to sleep often) and the recitations. Hated those recitation workshops. TA was a bit unfair on grading homework; no partial credit if you show all work but have the wrong answer | Very nice. Sometimes doesn't explain things totally clear, but if you have questions with the homework or whatever, he'll go over them in class. He's certainly an acceptable professor. | Very nice guy. I'm not sure how he would be for a regular math class, but for math history, he was very vague and a little confusing. The nature of the course requires some structure, which he didn't provide. We never really learned history; we just did problems from different areas of math. The exams were extremely random, grading a little harsh | so boring... | AH so Sean Connery. SO easy compared to other 300 teachers. so worth takin a friday class with him. If you dont take him just to avoid having class on Friday, you're stupid | He's an awesome professor with a real cool accent. He's extremely helpful and if you go to his office hrs he gives you really helpful hints for his exams. The exams are pretty easy as long as you go to lecture cuz he does cover all the material in lecture | Teaches the material very well | Awesome professsor. He knows his stuff, he's very helpful, and cares about his students. Take him if you have a chance! | thick accent...failed my ass cuz i missed passin by 1 point =( | No Comments"
"Vogelius, Michael","Worst teacher ever. Deliberately gave questions with complicated calculations, and if you miscalculated one of them, all the answers that followed were wrong. The test has nothing to do with what he taught. Please don't take his class. | Worst teacher ever. Deliberately gave questions with complicated calculations, and if you miscalculated one of them, all the answers that followed were wrong. The exams had basically nothing to do with what he was lecturing on. Don't take his class. | Never respond student's email. | Terrible grader. I asked him a question and didn't reach out to help. Emailed him about my grades and replied saying I might've received too much credit and that he'd take points off of my exam. Save yourself before you fail this class. | he definitely is not a good lecturer, the exam is basically irrelevant to the course content. yiu can't learn anything in this course. It will only make you wonder how unfair this person is to grade. | This guy gives computational homeworks and incredibly hard proof heavy exams. Ive taken proof classes before, but this was deceptive. Be prepared for proofs and tough exams. He may sound nice and seem like a nice guy who wants to help, but his grading will not reflect that. The review from 2006 sums it up perfectly. Its the same way then as now. | I took linear algebra course with Prof. Vogelius. He does not teach the mechanic of how to compute things here. He tries to explain a new point of view to linear algebra which was very interesting to me. I enjoyed the course and his classes though it was a bit hard to catch up sometimes. You should work hard on this course but it's worth it. | Lectures kept a perfect pace. Professor Vogelius made sure we understood every proof, every step of the way - highly conducive to understanding the material. Homework was graded fairly, and generously counted for 30% of grade - compare to courses based on nothing but examinations. Curve in the end of the class can only be described as very fair. | One of the best math profs I have had at Rutgers. Quite challenging but a very clear and inspiring lecturer. I definitely recommend him if you like math | He is HORRIBLE. He's not helpful and he does not care about his students. He did not have his lectures outlined in advance so we basically went in blind every class. When asked what to study for in the exam...he would just say everything in the chapters we covered. When asked to narrow it down...he would not. Do not take him!!!!!!!! | He wont answer any questions during office hours. Student: ""Can you help me how to do this"". Him: ""How about you tell me how or drop the class if you cant"" . HE SUCKS. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS FOR ANY CLASS OR YOU WILL BE SORRY AFTER YOU FAIL THE CLASS AND WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER AGAIN! | Material in class does not represent that on tests: tests are much more difficult. Teaches basic principles multiple times, wasting precious class time, while leaving the new material for the end of class and not fully reviewing it. | He is too busy for students. If you ask him a question, he avoids you. doesn't want to help you about hw at all. not in his office hour often. His lesson is clear. but if you don't need teacher's help at all, then you can take him. you gonna be surprised at the test. only two test. it will hurt you once you make mistakes. | Prof Vogelius was great! He used a lot of real-life examples and was great at relating to students. He was ALWAYS willing to help and would review something as many times as you needed. His exams had only 3-4 questions, but they were fair. He gave a more than generous curve! Overall, he's really nice and really fun! | Taking Numerical Analysis with Vogelius is a bad idea if you haven't had 300 and probably 311. He does proofs and gets into some difficult (to unprepared students) Real analysis. While I did fine in an Engineering Numerical Analysis course, I'm very much hoping I even got a C in this class. | This is not so much a professor rating than it is a warning...do not let the name of the course, Numerical Anaylsis, fool you. The course is very theoretical and you will have to do proofs. And everything this guy does is abstract, so if you hate concrete examples, you'll love this guy. | The book was pointless and very hard to understand. The class was extremely boring and he goes on and on during lecture...non stop writing. Material wasn't that bad. Homeworks didn't match lecture notes or exams. He's not a horrible teacher but I wouldn't rec. him. | Very clear helpful teacher... gives an in depth explanation of the subject. If u love math take him ;) Good curve on course. | One of the best prof's I ever had! He truly cared about students' understanding.The book was impossible to read, but the lectures were easy to follow.Granted his exams were challenging, but not impossible, and he did curve more than generously. Originally, I was NOT looking forward to taking the class, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. | Vogelius is an excellent professor. He explains everything very clearly. Yes, he is very challanging, but you will actually learn something from his class. His exams are tough, but he is a very fair grader. Just keep working hard, and you will be fine. If you care about learning the material, he is the best prof to take. | I hated this guy, and the class. He NEVER helps you when you need it. His lecturing is horrid, and his exams are so so hard. For a foundation course like this one, Vogelius is not the way to go. | Professor vogelius isnt a good math teacher because he jumps around too much and the class average on exam is absolutely dreadful. | Get a life! This guy is above average. I was in Prof. Voglius 354 class a couple of semesters ago. He was a very clear lecturer that tried to give a view different from the book's. His exams were difficult but in the end he was not an unreasonable grader. | i detest him. he refuses to help, he's very ambiguous in lecture. he doesnt go over homework and his exams are nothing like the homework. i took him for 300 before and im still failing it my 3rd time around. this guy rots. | avoid like the plague. he's a dirty old man, not to mention he can never answer your questions. he generates no interest in the material and does not assign grades fairly at all. he's worse then hector sussmann!! | Professor Vogelius is a good guy. He grades pretty fairly and de-emphasizes testing, creating a more positive learning enviornment. He counts homework as 30%. Pretty good lecturer too and answers all questions promptly. | No Comments"
"Wu, Chenxi","This class is an absolute joke. I honestly think his command of language is so poor that makes him unfit to be a lecturer. His notes are full of errors and honestly impossible to follow. This is the worst professor I've ever encountered at this institution. | He is a very nice person. The class is very difficult. He may need extra work to be a better lecturer. But he is very caring and he values his students a lot. I truly appreciate his helps. I know he tried so hard. I will try to comment again when the semester ends. So 5 for attitudes and 2 for the lecture itself. | Worst professor I ever had. He came in half way through as our previous professor had maternity leave. His lecture is super confusing and even though he tries, it doesn't seem to be helpful at all. I don't think he should ever consider teaching advanced math class in the future. If I had him since the beginning I would love to drop this class. | Wu is a nice guy, but his lectures are awfully confusing. I basically taught myself the whole course. I would avoid for math250, but he might be good for high-level math courses, since in his lectures he brought in proofs and tried to explain concepts in abstract ways. Great person, bad lecturer. | Positive. Wants students to learn. Constantly asks for feedback. Can be hard to understand but if you take the time out of your day to self-study and ask for help he will try his best to help you succeed! Don't listen to people who says his exams are impossible-he is literally modifying the final exam difficulty bc people did bad the 2nd midterm. | the lectures are hard to understand, but for most linear classes you have to end up learning on your own anyway, and its not terribly difficult material. the tests are difficult, but with it being open notes/calculator, it balances out. he also really wants his students to succeed, curve is great and he gives extra credit! | I took Linear Algebra with him, he teaches material in the most confusing way possible, and he doesn't prepare you at all for his tests. He's a nice guy who wants to help, but he's a horrible teacher, and he's unorganized and very confusing. | Came into this class with high hopes, seemed like a reasonable guy. However his lectures are completely incomprehensible.. it seems like he teaches in the most complicated way possible. This is coming from someone who reads the textbook and does ALL the practice problems in the book and attends every lecture. His exams are unreasonably impossible. | Avoid at all cost. Sample exams are nowhere similar to actual exams and he explicitly stated that. He is caring, wants to help, however, he made the course incredibly challenging | I want to preface this by saying he cares&puts effort in&wants feedback on how he's doing. That being said, WOW does he explain things in the wrong way. I took every calc prior to this and understand matrices. He explains in most compicated way possible and tests in a similar fashion. Prior knowledge didn't even help too much. Nice guy,bad teacher | One of the best professor in this school!!!!! Very patient and very nice! If you have any questions after class, he will stay and teach you until you understand. Also, if you email him some problems he will reply really fast with really specific processes"
"Tiep, Pham","Professor Tiep is the best math professor I have ever met. He is incredibly good at showing stuff and he is willing to explain every concepts precisely regardless how complicate it is. | Good professor, he is willing to take the time to explain any concepts to his students. Lectures are very proof heavy, and he tends to go a bit fast through the material if no one asks him to slow down. Easy exams, which are mostly applications of material without any proofs."
"Peruvemba Narayanan, Bhargav","This guy is not the best at teaching, he tries, but does not succeed. I literally learned everything myself. | Intro to Linear Alg isn't supposed to be hard. This prof goes at a somewhat quick speed. Consider taking another professor however it's the course material that is hard. You will have to learn it regardless. Maybe 6-12 hours per week of work if you want an A. He is a smart guy and as a prof he is fair. | Is he the best professor? No. With that being said, the material he teaches is not easy to grasp and almost everyone taking it hasn't been exposed to it (so obv its hard). Pay attention to lecture and *try* to understand the material - his courses and quizzes are very straightforward: he does not want you to fail. Make use of TAs. | Reads straight from textbooks and assumes that you will understand the Theorems on the first go. If you want to do well, prepare for lectures ahead of time although no college student will be able to regularly do this. I'd suggest taking Linear Algebra at Rutgers over the summer at a CC; there is no curve"
"Mavrea, Ioanna","This professor does not care for her students. There is very little help she offers outside of class let alone in class. Asking questions in class feels very daunting as she is not eager to help students. Grading is very unclear in how she gives points on midterms. Attendance in lecture is mandatory as she gives in class assignments. | She's the best! :) Go to her lectures—she gives extra credit that can be used on exams. Go to her office hours to show that you care, and she'll help you as best as she can. She holds reviews before exams, which are really helpful. | Go to class—there's lots of extra credit. She's sarcastic with unfunny jokes, but if that offends you, you're just sensitive. Go to her office hours and show effort; she'll help you succeed. She explains things well, and her reviews give helpful study hints. Before the final, she was on Zoom answering questions from 7-11 PM daily. She's goated. | do just the review sheets before the exams, and you will ace the exam and explain concepts well | Rudest professor I have ever had. She loved giving out surprise pop quizzes and wouldn't respond to emails. Avoid at all costs, genuinely ruined my experience at Rutgers. | While this professor can be tough, the class is manageable with the right approach. Attending lectures, reading the textbook, and using tools like Unstuck AI for study prep can really help. Overall, an engaging but challenging course. | Please if you read this, stay away from her! She is the worst professor ever! I have never met such a rude and uncaring professor in my life! She rudely replies to your answers, her explanations are vague. It will give you the most stressful and uncomfortable moments of your life. Harsh grader and lecture heavy! | Professor Mavrea was extremely rude and unforgiving throughout her instruction of Multivariable Calculus. She cancelled class on short notice several times but would take great offense if students would need to make up an assignment or exam due to illness or extenuating circumstance. Strongly urge to take another professor. | Unbelievably dismissive and rude to students. Cancelled class many times. Not worth the tuition or learning. | AVOID AT ALL COSTS -Exams are drastically harder compared to other sections -Goes completely out of order -Extremely incoherent lectures that she often cancels last-second (got so bad our LA started private lectures so we could actually learn -Very nasty, trying to get extra help results in her insulting your work ethic -Inconsistent grading | Nasty | Love her! Caring, reasonable, but has quirks. Wants induction formatted in very rigid way. Used to announce quizzes but eventually gave them at random (which she used to mandate attendance). Easy exams. Puts in effort to get to know each student individually. Sometimes deducts points for no clear reason, but will give them back if you talk to her. | Unpleasant disposition | I didn't particularly care for this professor and have to take the class again this summer. | Prof. Mavrea is an awesome instructor! Take her if you ever get the chance, especially for Math 300 which is all proofs. She has us work in groups during every class which helps. Her lectures are very interactive. Seriously my favorite professor at Rutgers! | This is my first time taking DEs and first time taking this professor. Her lectures are very detailed and her lecture notes are fantastic! She is very sweet during class, and we are already working in groups (for extra credit). So far, so good! | Was my 2nd time taking Multi. I was afraid to take Mavrea b/c of the reviews here; so glad I did. She shares extensive lecture notes and loads of review material w/answers. Had extra office hrs before the exams (even in evenings). Gave a lot of extra credit. (Our TA for that class was horrid though.) Take her if you want to learn calc3. | Best professor I have had in math in years! I loved going to her class. The topics were not that easy but Mavrea made it interesting (her lecture notes are also full of weird stories that kept us laughing). I am planning on taking her again in 300 next semester. A+++ | Mavrea gives TONS of extra points! Exams are just like the problems in lecture and reviews. Her lecture notes are typed and are very detailed. First time I got 100 in any exam (I had already failed this class before.) She is fantastic. I wish I had her in all my math classes. | Mavrea is a the nicest math professor I have had - a bit too nice and students are taking advantage of that. Her lectures are amazing (have inspired me to be a teacher). She has met me repeatedly outside of office hours, even late in the evening, to help. She is great! | This is the 3rd time I am taking Prof. M. Her lectures are amazing!!! There is LOTs of group work which is great. I have made quite a few new friends. This is the one class I go to even if I am tired. Her problem setups are funny and, no, she is not a tough grader. I am planning on taking her again for 300, if she teaches it next semester. A+++ | The best professor I have taken at Rutgers. Love her! She is caring, and she gives a lot of different examples in lecture. She also gives a lot of extra credit. It is unfortunate that so many of my classmates are so rude with her. | She was the best math professor I've taken at college. Of course, the course was hard but she explained very well and took the time to help students out, if you are not disciplined it would not be a surprise that you do bad in Calc III or any class. Every class in college required effor and Calc III is no difference | Pop quizzes and a tough grader | Very passive aggressive with monotonous lectures and unreliable grading policies - if you can take someone else, please do | Her lectures prepare you for the exams. I never skipped lecture because she makes calc easy to understand. Even if you need clarification about algebraic steps, she'll quickly help you and make it easy to understand. The only ""difficult"" thing was the quizzes, but she curves those at the end so it was fine. Sad she doesn't teach Calc 4. | She is the worst professor I have ever had at Rutgers. Her grading is so arbitrary that you will get points off just because your solution is different from hers, no matter if it's correct or not. Also, she will give quizzes without announcing them beforehand. Avoid her class at all levels. | Most of your grade relies on your 2 midterms, quizzes, and your final. Calc 3 is hard with any professor but I definitely felt as if there could have been more done to prepare students for the quizzes. Also she makes review sheets with answers but no solutions guide, which makes learning just that much harder. Take a different professor if you can. | She is a very bad teacher and I pray no one takes her calc 3 class. Her class is 92% exams and the midterms/ final are common hour but her quizzes are impossible on purpose so she can boost the end curve. You may think that is a good thing until you bomb every quiz and she gives no explanation for it. DONT TAKE HER JUST CAUSE HER CLASS IS AFTER 10 | Took asynch Math 152. Not an easy course by any means. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone who is not confident in their math abilities prior to taking Calc 2. However, her online lectures do prep you for exams. Beware though: she is an extremely tough grader. Make sure you include every step of solving the problem in your work. | I failed 152 before but I am on my way to an A now with Mavrea, in her async class. Her lectures and lecture notes are amazing! If you have not taken Calc I in a while, take her. She a very sweet woman, and always stays overtime during office hours. Also, look at her wokrsheets. Exams are similar. | I would have failed without her. She is sooooo helpful! Study her lecture notes, go to class, and go to her office hours. She stays for hours helping students after class. Those who say she is mean, they have not met her. She is the best prof I have ever had, | She's a good person, very sweet, and ready to make accommodations for those who need them. But SO MANY QUIZZES AND EXAMS!!!! we had a quiz every Wednesday and an exam every other week. dreadful. personally wouldn't take it again. | Professor Mavrea is a nice person. She seems to be understanding, but does not always explain things the clearest. The entire Calculus I course was incredibly hard and many students in my class received the ""in danger of failing"" notice from the University. The assignments were not graded fairly and the course was way too difficult to come in to. | The entire Calculus 1 course is just all over the place. She is very nice but there is just too much information in the course for it to make sense. I ended up going to YouTube to learn the material at a slower pace. I started to understand it much more when I did this, as opposed to class. Exams are worth most of the grade, which I'm not a fan of. | She's not easy, but she explains stuff well. You're probably screwed if you don't pay attention in class-- reading the (free, which was nice) textbook doesn't make up for missing lecture. I felt like she gave way too little time on quizzes, but a decent bit on exams. No pop quizzes, but there were surprise workshops for participation grade. | I have Mavrea this semester. I was hesitant taking her class because of some of the reviews here. I am so glad I did. She is so kind, and caring. She holds long office hours. As others have said, her lectures are awesome. We had someone cover for her when she was sick once, and that did not go well at all. Prof. Mavrea is a great math teacher! A+ | Prof Mavrea is the best professor I have had in years, especially in math. She is a tough grader in the midterms but by the time we took the final our class was able to perform as well as the honors. She offers endless office hours. A+++++ | She was awful. She never posted assignments at times that we could do them, constantly posted homework with incorrect due dates and changed them later, and worst of all posted no announcements for any of these changes. There were no rubrics for quizzes so it was difficult to tell what we were losing points on. Never want to take her class again | 300 is a hard course but Mavrea makes it simple. She goes through detailed proofs during lecture and her exams are a lot like the problems we work during workshops. She gives plenty of extra credit. Love her class! | Interesting examples, clear lectures, friendly professor! | I don't get those that say she is rude or not caring. Mavrea offers extra office hours and reviews, even in the weekends and late at night. She is always encouraging us to keep working and ask her questions. Had her in 152 last year and got an A. Take her if you want to learn the material. She posts lost of worksheets with answers on every topic.:) | OMG. I just aced the second midterm in multivariable! I failed calc 2 twice before I finally passed with a C. Mavrea deserves a promotion. She is great at making the material easy to understand, prepares good reviews, and she is always available by email. I agree with others that she is tough grader, but she makes it up at the end with the curve. | Her lectures are amazing: super clear and informative. She is also super nice and helpful during office hours! A+ | Not a good teacher, has trouble explaining concepts that seem basic when reviewed with proper explanation. Regret having her for calculus. | There's a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm really glad I took Mavrea's section. During lectures, she is very clear and explains the material very well. There's not too much work outside of class besides reading the textbook and studying for exams. The quizzes and exams are definitely hard, but if you go to class and do the worksheets you're good. | I am only about a week into my course, and I am taking it online. However, she gives TERRIBLE feedback for what you did wrong on assessments. She doesn't post the answers either so you have no idea how to fix your errors. Online, she is constantly talking through assessments to tell people to adjust their cameras and is just not a pleasant teacher. | I wish I had Mavrea in high school . She delivers crystal clear lectures, super funny, and caring. Her worksheets are soooo helpful. Her exams are just like her class examples, adn worksheet problems. There are no surprises if you attend class. She also gives a ton of reviews. Best prof so far at Rutgers! | I don't know what all of you talking about. This is not the Mavrea I know. She is incredible, both in her lectures and support of her students. And she give regular reviews. Even students from other sections show up. She has been the best professor I have by far since I came to Rutgers. | A lot of people complain about her and granted, she can be kind of rude in class sometimes but go to her office hours and she has no problem explaining questions to you. Her practice exams are pretty terrible and her lectures can be all over the place. Just try to do as many book problems and actually read if you have the time. | She's a pretty decent lecturer. You're gonna have to put in a lot of work to do well in 251, but she is available for help if you need it. She has the unique trait of being mean, but hilarious at the same time. She'll roast kids for giving a wrong answer, and it's so funny. Don't skip lecture, ask for extra help, and you'll be fine. | below average prof, tough quizzes, mediocre lectures. If you want an A, do all odd textbook problems, I guarantee you will get an A. | Worst professor I've ever had. She offered some help before the first midterm and changed completely after. She does not reply her email after first midterm unless it is about something urgent(if you are sick and you need a makeup,etc.). If you want to find a caring professor then don't take her class. | Mavrea is tough, but her worksheets prepare you so well for her exams as they are in the same style and most often, harder. Calc 2 is impossible on its own, but she really tries to help, her lecture notes are so valuable for studying. Workshops are annoying but she is very willing to help. Also really funny! If you have the time take her class | Very caring professor! She writes her own worksheets and her quizzes come out of that. She is very energetic in class, gives a lot of office hours and responds to email at all times of day and night. She is tough but explains everything! If you want to learn, take her for Cal 1, 2, or 3. I loved her for all three. | Had this professor for Calc 1 - avoid this class. Worst ever and explaining concepts. Doesn't give partial credit. Worst Every! Avoid at all cost. | Prof Mavrea is a good professor considering how difficult calc 2 is. She is a tough grader and does not give much partial credit. Her lectures are in depth and a bit fast paced but if you do some work on your own time, you'll pass. | Not a great professor. She can be funny during lectures occasionally. She is the only professor I never talked to because she seemed judgmental when people asked questions, and wasn't very helpful. She doesn't do a great job of explaining concepts; she often just writes on the board a lot without explaining. | the worst professor at Rutgers. shows no respect and exams are extremely hard. | She wasn't able to answer some of the webassign problems herself. She is probably ok for calc 1 but not a good teacher for calc 3. She also doesn't talk much about applications in physics that are important for engineering majors. | Barely passed CalcII and was afraid I was going to fail Calc3. Pror Mavrea taught me 251 and helped me figure out what I did not understand in Calc 2. I love this professor. She deserves a raise. | She takes extra time outside her office hours to help you. She replies to emails at all times of day and night. Mavrea is very passionate about her students and she is a great motivator. I am planning to take her again in Calc 2. | Love Prof Mavrea. She is super smart, crystal clear, and gives you lots of opportunity for extra credit. Love, love, love! | Learning anything under this woman is utterly impossible. I can't even recommend her class if you're a pure self study student, because her chaotic way of doing things makes it difficult to understand what she expects you to know. Also seems to lack motivation to teach, and sympathizes only with her""best"" students. Avoid at all costs. | It is really important that you attend lecture because she really outlines everything you need to know, I never used a book. You can tell that she really knows her stuff. Her exams are pretty difficult but there is a big curve. Do her worksheets and email/go to office hours to as questions about them. Also bring any exam to her to look at again | I love Prof Mavrea. I took her for 151, 152 and 251. I had failed 151 before I retook it with her. I have never worked so hard in my life! I ended up with B+, A, and A. She is a slave driver but you will learn! I also believe she may never sleep. She responds to emails all night long, sending us worksheets and answers, extra examples with pictures | Terrible. Doesn't show any signs of actually caring for her students. She won't hesitate to give you a zero on a workshop, which serves no point other than to discourage students from actually doing the workshops (since they are such a small portion of the grade). Her teaching also lacks enthusiasm, and depth. Explanations are mediocre. Avoid her. | Going to lecture is definitely a must. If you have workshops, get help from her in office hours. She might seem scary but she's actually pretty nice. If you show you care and are trying, she'll help you. Go to as many review sessions as you can, especially hers cuz she gives inside info about the exams. Quiz questions come from the weekly worksheet | Very good professor. Demands high work ethic but is very clear in lecture. Difficult exams but doing all the hw and keeping up with the quizzes is sufficient to get a good grade on exams. | She is a terrible teacher and person. She doesn't care about students at all."
"Rong, Xiaochun","I took two classes with him and actually learned to enjoy his class more and more. His class is definitely not ""easy,"" but as the semester progressed, I got more used to his exams and was able to improve. His homework might be on the heavier and harder side. If you don't mind being a bit challenged, his class is worth taking. | Homework is TOO MUCH.Every week, there're 15-20 problems,which took me 8-10 hours to do them.However, most of the homework problems are NOT worth the time I spent on them:some of the problems are excessively tricky,and others are simply the repetitions of basic theorems.But his lecture is good:motivations and examples are explained clearly. | No notes for lectures are given. If you miss any lecture, you do not have a chance to recover it. Hard exam. Do not take this course with him. | He is a very kind professor. In the process of learning from him. He doesn't require you to sign in, but I suggest you go to class on time. The exam is not difficult, it's computational, it doesn't involve a lot of theorems. But 350 is not an easy course, so don't try it if you're not a passionate math enthusiast. | In the exam only test how to calculate, and little theorem. No prove problems, it likes math 250. | Avoid him at all costs as it's tough to understand his accent and because he just skims over the theorems without actually telling us how to use them for MATH 311. | COVID-19 made all classes online, but most professors prepared for this to happen as they were told in advance, he didn't. This guy barely knew how to work anything. His accent & hand is not only hard to understand, but he's lazy with it. He also runs circles around your questions confusing himself and us more. Rong also lied to us about tests too. | Professor Rong does have an accent which made it alittle hard to understand but it is math so its not confusing as your mostly dealing with numbers. He even writes down what he is saying so it helps. however, he is a very very understanding professor! Calc 4 is not easy, but he makes it manageable. Does not want you to fail | If you try and are good at teaching yourself from the book, you can get a good grade. | he has an accent but is very passionate about what he is doing. you should go over the text book and review the examples given in class before tests. tests are all things you have went over in class or on hw | This guy seems like he doesn't care. He comes in, writes out his examples on the board and leaves. He never pauses to take questions. He also doesn't give practice exams, and it seems like he picked at random the problems he suggested we practice from the textbook. Many of them were tedious wastes of time compared to what he tested us on. | Takes a while to get used to his accent. Will often make mistakes while doing practice problems on the board and seems to have trouble understanding students' questions as well. Had to teach myself most of the material. | Strong Chinese accent, boring lectures, Straightforward Tests (mechanical) | He does a lot of profs in class but doesn't test on them so that is good. If you do the homework and textbook examples you should be fine on the midterms and final, however, I wouldn't say they were easy. You definitely need to study for the class but you don't need to go to lectures to do well because he follows the textbook pretty closely. | His accent is not that bad. If you do the homework, you can get a pretty good score on 2 midterms. The final is tough, but the curve is very friendly. Do the homework, you can get at least B+. | Pretty average teacher. His accent is really not that bad. I got way average on both midterms (78 and 88), and I though I did well on the final and I got a B. He also grades in a way that certain amount of kids in the class get A's | As others have said you do get used to the accent. He makes many mistakes during lecture (especially the practice problems) and it gets annoying often. Personally I taught myself more than he taught me. I never got the material until I sat down one day and read through the chapters word for word. His tests are really tough and borderline fair. | He runs a very straightforwards class: learn at lectures, do the (optional) homework and maple labs, take the quizzes and 2 midterms + a final. He doesn't push the theory too hard and spends a lot of time on helpful examples. His tests are very challenging, but never unfair. Has a habit of making mistakes in his examples though... | The test is easy, and grading criteria are lenient. He speaks clearly on the lecture, and when you ask for help, he's there. | Gotta get used to his accent, however, he goes much in depth to teach. Uses many proofs to verify equations,concepts. Doing the homework, really helps with quizzes and tests | Pretty brutal accent to accompany a completely trivial subject. Homeworks are stupidly easy, fostering a false sense of security while the exams are to prone to cause sensitive students to have emotional breakdowns. Would recommend dodging this dude at all costs. | hardest final ive ever seen | Bad accent. Final grade based on 2 exams + final exam and homework. Got A's on both first 2 exams, did some homework, I believe I did well on the final exam and got a C as my final grade. How is that possible I do not know. | He's really nice and helpful even though he uses the textbook, you can learn more if you do the work too. You get used to the accent. His tests are tough, but they're ok. Average tends to be ~55 so anything above that and you're good. | Excellent Calc teacher. Lecture is very organized and is responsive to students. He uses effective methods to help students clear the fog surrounding Calculus. Introduces a lecture with how a topic applies to the real world. Game me a strong foundation for Calc II | He is a nice guy. Moves rather fast in the lectures. Once you get used to the Chinese accent, you'll be alright. I don't go to class much as he confuses me, so I heavily depend on recitation. Guess it depends on the person. Exams aren't too easy - make sure you do everything on the syllabus, even though he doesn't personally assign it for homework. | He's a pretty decent lecturer (once you get past the Engrish, count the times he says ""Wector we""), but the fact that he takes attendance for the lecture and other silly things (like seating by name during exams, for example) will drive you up the wall. | u get used to his accent. people said hes difficult but the review guide is a replica of the exam so its not that bad. he is pretty thorough and clear. you should do well with the final curve | You will get used to his accent after a few classes. If you want to understand, go to class, but you could probably just teach yourself. Class is heavily curved (i got a 52% on the final, and 68% on midterm, and stopped handing in homework after the midterm) and still got a C. The class is hard, but with such a big curve it's bearable. | You'll get used to his Clinglish eventually. All the examples he uses in class are from the book. The tests are kinda hard though. The class average for the first midterm in my class was 60 out of 100 | The accent is terrible, but the class is great. He always seems to have the answer to any question one may ask and to every problem in the book. He presents the classes very organize and clearly. The best way of learning Calculus | Very clear, much better than other professors. If you don't understand something, he'll think of another way to present it, and he'll do so until you understand - sign of a true teacher. Accent is thick, but you get used to it. | This class is simple, so are the exams. I see other people in Calc I who have to do all the problems on the syllabus, Rong only makes you do 10 a week, and a workshop. Recessitation is pointless, but u have to go. | Jesus, I can't seem to understand why people have such an issue with these classes. If you're in engineering and you take this guy expect an easy A the exams are painfully easy, you can sleep through all his classes and miss absolutely nothing. Recitation is useless. Easy class. | One of the best math professors at Rutger's. His Chinese accent was pretty bad at first, but you get used to it. Professor is very knowledgable and a very nice guy. | hard class, not a bad teacher | Very smart and very organized. Once you get passed his accent he is easy to understand. Very friendly and helpful too."
"Rota, Franco","I took this course in a flipped classroom format. Lectures were posted and clearly organized with notes accessible for all sections. Discussions of example problems were thorough. Professor Rota readily took questions and immediately began explaining concepts to help students understanding. Great handwriting, good sense of humor, easygoing, humble. | hard class no matter who's your prof but I'm happy I had him. Teaches from book. Gave tons of partial credit which saved me. Class is coordinated so he doesn't make the exams. We all failed one quiz, so he made the next one much easier to help out. Participation was really helpful!! Curved really well- I had an 82 and got an A. Take him if you can! | Adjusted well to the online classes. Has a great personality that he brings to class everyday. Is always available to extra help. Just overall great! | Skipped almost every lecture, but was able to self study for the material. The exams that he gives are fair and he makes sure that whatever questions he gives are stuff that's been in the HW/textbook. Even after 1/4 of the class was caught cheating on the midterm (people copied word for word from chegg), the final exam was very fair. | Franco is a nice guy , but he isn't great at explaining many of the concepts taught in the class. He follows the textbook very closely as he teaches( preferred by some, not so much by others), and he seems to be very knowledgeable about the material. His exams are fair if you seem to understand what's going on in class, so always attend his classes | He just lectured straight from the textbook. He seemed to care about his students, but didn't act on it. This class is a lot of work to do the bare minimum level of home work, nonetheless get good grades on labs, quizzes, and tests. | Went to his lectures for only the first two weeks, and did not understand info the way he conveyed it (waste of time) I self-studied, and ended up getting above average on all exams. He doesn't curve the class, so im sure a lot of my peers did worse than me, but if you take this class make sure it is definitely a priority throughout the semester."
"Perelman, Naum","I love Naum Perelman. He is a very sweet and caring professor. However, it would be nice if his workshops were more interactive, and we were able to use our video and audio and discuss the problems rather than simply reporting our solutions in the chat. Make sure you are active in class, or he will call you out for it! | Worst workshop I have ever attended. Disabling your microphone and camera were mandatory. Instead of collaborating or discussing the exercises you simply watched him complete yhem. You could wholeheartedly mute the most of the workshop and only listen on him assigning the homework. Perhaps he is a better instructor for in-person classes. | I had him for a TA for calc 251 and he goes over material before quizzes but is clueless when it comes to being a teacher in general. Doesn't respond to emails and never gives a straight forward answer to questions from the students. He always assumes that you know the material and rushes through the recitation. | I had him for Calc 135 Recitation. Very sweet man who clearly wants to see us succeed. But, often came off as rude when answering students' questions. Very reasonable grader. Went over the material right before the quizzes, often told us what was going to be on the quiz - most of us got 10/10 every week unless we were totally lost. Just be patient. | Lol at all the premeds giving this guy a bad rating when they took the wrong class. Stay in your lane. I took this class as a Philosophy major coming from 135, and Perelman made the concepts easy to understand. He have us both proofs and examples for many of the concepts, and gave us much time in class to practice problems with him. | He's a very decent professor. I see that several premeds here have rated him poorly for his class being ""too difficult."" I disagree. There has to be an effort to learn something. There is no free A! Trust me that if you are willing to dedicate yourself to learning, you will see clearly that Naum is a great instructor. | Not enough practice problems. Would not take again. | Its a 2-in-1 class. Nothing more, nothing less. You get what you put into it. | Spent the first half of the class talking about the days when he was a pilot and the days when he collaborated with psychologists to design a national 4-hour exam for undergrads. Spent the second half of the class rushing through concepts. Did not learn anything and felt unprepared for the final. | CALC 152 Recitation: Naum is an amazing TA. His recitations are very helpful for exam preparation. During recitations, he won't hesitate to help anyone who is lost. Write-ups are graded with ease. | Unless you are an engineer, CS major, Math major, Stat major, Physics major, and or Chem major, Calc 151 is obsolete and dross especially if you take his section. Course structure and exams are designed to abate and juggernaut, not ameliorate, your GPA. Take Calc 135 instead if you are planning to go to med school. | Do not take this class unless you are an engineer. Exams are difficult and contain primarily theoretical questions written for people with PhDs making this course feel like a second Expos. If you are premed take Calc 135 or CP Calculus instead so you can still have a good GPA before Boikess Orgo. You do not want to be weeded out before Orgo. | He is difficult to understand. No practice problems. | you need to have a phd in math to understand him. | He was such a good calc TA and would give quizzes after teaching the material thoroughly and leaving the work on the board. He has an accent but it's really easy to understand him regardless. God bless this man, I definitely would not have passed Calc without him. | Premed here. Along with Boikess Orgo, this course is one of the more difficult courses that RU has to offer. Under Perelman this course feels like a graduate course. His exams are theoretical rather than computational. Workshops are beyond the scope of this course. Final exam has nothing to do with the lectures. Take Math 135 instead. | Same textbook as AP Calculus AB. But exams cover concepts intended for upperclassmen and grad students since most of the questions are proofs. There are no proofs in AP Calculus AB. Also final has nothing to do with the lectures, homeworks, and workshops making it difficult to study adequately. | Exam questions were taken from previous Math 300 exams which is beyond the scope of the course. Workshops take hours to complete without a group that is willing to collaborate. Spent 4 hours on a question and got no answer. Should align the class with the curriculum. | Knows what he's doing. I liked his class. | To the person below: talk for yourself. Not all students want him to leave. Some actually like him. | Knows what hes talking about. Calc 151 was easy with him. | Had him as a TA. It is sometimes hard to understand what he is saying due to a heavy accent. He basically goes through problems similar to the optional TB homework very fast and doesn't explain them well. When someone asks whats going on, he rarely answers their question. If you do the optional HW and pay attention, you'll be fine on the quizzes. | Based on standards Math 135 is supposed to be easier than AP Calculus AB (151) which I got an A+ in during Senior year of HS. However, Perelman makes a CP Calculus course extraordinarily challenging with his exams that has nothing to do with the lectures or textbooks. Also sets up a Sakai site to send emails about football, commencement, etc. | The only thing I respect about Perelman is his own knowledge about calc. However, I don't appreciate him as a person and a professor. I didn't understand a topic so I visited his office hours on Livingston just for him to sigh every time I didn't understand something. Sorry for wanting to learn and succeed. | I think the problem why students complain about this prof is that they didn't have good math teachers in the past. There was nothing ""impossible"" in his tests, and workshops are pretty much the same for all instructors (they select them from the same set of problems). Also, final isn't written by Perelman, so please don't confuse potential students | If test averages are in 40s, it's not that bad. There are plenty of instructors whose averages are even lower, and this doesn't mean that the instructor is bad. Many students have bad foundation and are not willing to work. If you have solid precalculus knowledge and actually work hard, then Perelman is pretty good. I learned a lot from him. | very difficult to pass for students like me who arent good in calc | Serious students will learn from Perelman. Word ""student"" comes from Latin meaning ""dedicating myself to"". No dedication - no result. The ""raters"" below are indeed KIDS or A KID. All potential students, be aware that all these neg. comments are left within a few days, showing the same grade, which is statistically impossible to be true. | I can't stop laughing reading what these kids wrote. Claiming that a professor is ruining their chances for grad. school while taking an elementary Math course! The problem is that a disproportionate number of students in Math151 is actively hostile to any attempts to educate them. Perelman isn't easy but he knows his stuff. I recommend him. | Perelman cannot teach at all. I received an A+ in Calc in high school, but with Perelman, my current grade is a 48. Everyone before me says he is not good at teaching, and unfortunately for me it's true. | This part-time lecturer is terrible. I use teacher because I feel the term professor should be saved people who do research. He does not talk loudly. Even if he did, he makes too many mistakes on the board. | In class he would do easy examples making students believe that they understand the concepts. On the exams those easy examples are either replaced with concepts that were never covered or abstract theories. | If you are taking this class, make sure that you know people who took it in previous semesters since he tends to recycle questions from previous exams and workshops. This way you can help each other prepare for the exams and workshops by memorizing the answers. | I put in tons of effort in this class for the entire semester and did not do well due to the difficult exams. Only 10% of the class got A's and B's while the other half did not pass. He does not tell you the cutoff to pass the course until after the final, so it did not help the people that were in a bad boat at that time. | The average on the first exam was a 48, which was supposed to be the easiest. Unless you took AP Calculus AB in high school already, you aren't going to learn much from this guy. | Exams and workshops are difficult for this course. Maybe the problems are a good fit for an upper-level math course but not for an introductory course. | If you take Calc with him, you are fried bacon with a side of toast and poached eggs. Arrogant engineers and difficult workshops and exams. Makes up policies like if you fail the final, you automatically fail the class. Basically your grade is not in your own hands. Do not take him unless you want to become breakfast. | Naum is the man! He cracked occasional jokes and quizzes were easy. | Perelman's exams may be a good fit for a 300- or 400-level math course but not for an introductory level course. All the students in his class are freshmen, which means that they have just left high school and are still transitioning to college. He should give exams that is their level. | Perelman is difficult for most freshman. His exams are not impossible for engineers, but for everyone else. For those of you reading in the summer, don't even touch AP Calculus AB (151) during the school year. Take regular Calc (135) instead during the school year or AP Calculus AB (151) in the summer. | I tried extremely hard in this class and still did not pass. Lectures does not help much. I tried to go to his office hours but he was busy. | Dangerous. As one person already stated run for the hills. I had so much trouble understanding the concepts. He's mean and grades very hard. He gives failing grades like it's candy. | Calc I was a nightmare with him. He made the class a lot more difficult than it had to be. Lectures were straight from the book. Doing the easy examples that were in the book does not help that much for his exams. Averages were in the low 60's for each exam. | This class is not that bad. It is just harder than every concept in Orgo except carbonyls, synthesis, mechanisms (complex ones), and certain parts of NMR. This class is as difficult as carbonyls, synthesis, mechanisms, and certain parts of NMR. I received similar scores on the exam about those topics and the exams and workshops in this class. | This professor would be decent for upper level courses or colleges, but not for an introductory course or college since what he expected was extremely high for a 100-level course or this college. He should be teaching a 300- or 400-level course instead. | If you think you can handle calc and have never taken it before , do not take perelman dodge him you will fail. he explains problem then hits you with an extremely difficult one on the exam. professor will not explain professor will skip steps and he will not give you the attention a person who has not taken calc before needs. | Worst lecturer I have ever had at this school. Even if you study all the chapters from the book, all the lecture notes, and do all the HW problems, his exams are still tricky. He refuses to answer questions. Unfortunately, he is still teaching this course. | Caution: Do not take a class with this part-time lecturer. These reviews are not exaggerations. He graded the exams with a vendetta. Grading policy makes no sense such as if you fail the final regardless of final score you fail the whole course, which means if you have an A before the final and failed that exam, then you will still receive a F. | Exams are harder than Orgo, which makes no sense for people who just graduated from high school. He should teach Math 300 (Mathematical Reasoning) instead of Math 151 (Calculus I for Mathematical and Physical Sciences aka AP Calculus AB) since he loves to give proofs on the exams. | Makes a basic freshman course harder than every other course in this school including grad school and most colleges in the country including the most prestigious ones. | During the earlier times, Boikess and Roth were his best friends and is still his friend today. They influenced him to create difficult open-ended problems on the exams and workshops. They also influenced him to teach freshmen so that they will end up with a low GPA and cause other professors to look down upon them when applying for research. | Calc 151 with Perelman was a nightmare. Lectures are long. 1 minute feels like 6 hours. Workshops and exams are difficult, more difficult than Orgo. He is just as terrible as Boikess, who is probably his mate. You do not want a low GPA during your first semester of Freshman year. I should've dropped that class and run for the hills. | This course should be an advanced 400-level course rather than a 100-level AP course. Due to the intense difficulty, Rutgers should make this course pass or fail, weigh the final grade, or just disregard the final grade in general for those who do poorly. | Through the difficult workshop problem sets and exams, this class will make your GPA go extinct and you will be filtered out early from the med school process. You do not want to be weeded out during the pre-Orgo age. | In class, he would do examples that are simple enough so that everyone would understand. However, on the exams, those simple questions are replaced with questions that are either complex, theoretical, or simply one that deals with concepts that he never taught us. | Workshop problems are difficult to do independently. | His exam problems are difficult to attempt. | If you want to go to med or grad school, do not take this course. Take 135 instead. This class is as difficult as Orgo. You do not want to be in a bad position before Boikess Orgo since you are only allowed to have one weak grade during your entire undergraduate career, which means C+-F for most schools or B-F for upper-level schools. | Horrible professor at rutgers. If you can avoid him, please do. This professor makes his exams very hard, while his reviews always seem to be quite easy. The averages on the two exams given by him were always failing grades. His lectures are a mess usually, we can barely see what he does on the board since he stands right in front it. | I took Calculus in high school and passed with an A+. However, this class was tough since Perelman would ask some theoretical questions on each of his exam. Most people struggled since the average of both exams were in the 60's. I scored below average on both exams though. | Perelman gives difficult exams and quizzes for a regular high school level Calc course. For example, he gave us an optimization problem of a cylinder. This is the same problem that he gave to his AB Calc (151) class. | He is not negotiable about make-ups so try to not be sick on exam days. Even then you are almost guaranteed to fail his exams since most of the questions are proofs. For example, he wants us to use the squeeze theorem to prove (arctanhx^2) sqrt(x^3) or use the inverse trig identities to prove arc functions. | This class was terrible. If you even make one little mistake, he will not give you partial credit. This class was also full of arrogant engineers. Unfortunately, I have to work with them during workshop. They did not even attempt the problems. Instead the engineers just talked about electrical and mechanical engineering for the whole period. | For a typical freshman math class in college or an AP Calc AB course in high school, this class is was tough. His exams were theoretical rather than computational. Workshop write-ups were due every week and were difficult since many engineering students were arrogant and did not want to collaborate with others when working in small groups. | If you get him as an instructor, I would recommend transferring to Calc 135 (aka regular Calc) or switching to an easier section of 151 (aka AP Calculus AB). His exams are really difficult for an AP class. Most of the questions are proofs. Due to this reason, about half of the class failed and have to take this class again in the Spring. | Very hard. Final was very impossible. Failed, which impacted my GPA so much that I was placed on academic warning (got all A's and B's in other classes). Good luck to all the Freshman who has him now. | Over all he is a pretty hard professor. I got a 42 on the first exam, 88 on the second and an 88 on the final. With the curve I ended with an A. So it is possible to get a good grade. You really get what you put in for this class. | Great professor, same with the TA. The midterm exams were easy, as were the quizzes. I got As on all of them. The final was easy too, but I failed it (If you fail the final, you automatically fail he course). I know that had I actually studied, I'd have gotten an A on the final. Apart from that, it's an easy class and the exams are easy. Study tho! | I really liked Perelman, his accent is NOT that hard to understand. The first exam was a bit harder than the second, but I didn't go to the review session for the first one. Final exam was pretty self-explanatory. He's a great teacher, very helpful in lecture. GO TO LECTURE. The TA doesn't teach you anything. Didn't need/buy the textbook. | EASY! Exam 1: EXACTLY like his review. Exam 2: Close to his review, but NOT exact. Final: Pretty hard, BUT if you don't know a question, go up to him. Point at it. Say am I doing this right? He will legit tell you what to do. I asked and got them all right. Got a B in class (messed up 2nd exam because I assumed it would be as easy as the 1st one])"
"Chanillo, Sagun","Doesn't put in any grades into canvas until the semester is completely over. He hasn't put in a single grade yet. Nobody knows what they have in class which is crazy. Good lecturer overall tho | very professional and fair. He is very good at what he's teaching. However, lectures can be hard to understand. But he will answer any questions asked in class. If you email him, he will definitely answer. | The rare professor who actually believes in the beauty of their subject. I am taking a graduate course from him, and his love for the subject is infectious. Makes me want to prove hard theorems so that maybe he'd nod approvingly. Interestingly, he is teaching a course that he has indeed shaped in many ways. Hence, offers interesting anecdotes. | Another hidden legend! If you want to really learn Calc 3 and keep an open mind this is your guy. He puts a lot of effort in his lectures and helps make the material click. You may not understand everything the first time, just keep reenforcing and practicing - comes together in the end. Doesn't give much required hw, makes math interesting | No Sakai page, pretty bad at explaining things. | The others who rated Professor chanillo for this semester's 251 are seriously salty lol. I thought he was an amazing lecturer who always made the concepts click. He must've given a great curve, I did very well on the two exams but bombed the final and still managed an A for the course. I'll be looking to take him for any future math courses. | AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! WORST PROFESSOR AT RU. He can't even give a proper lecture without it being confusing. He tries to crack jokes in class, but they are so bad that they make me cringe. I regret taking him when there were so many other choices. Does not provide practice exams either and doest know how to even use sakai properly. | Don't take this guy. Awful lecturer, had no idea what was going on. His exams are extremely hard and is worded in length. First time ever I failed Calculus. And from my understanding, Calc 3 was supposed to be very easy. | Worst Professor I have ever had. Awful teaching style. Doesn't explain anything on the board, simply does problems without context. Do yourself a favor and SWITCH OUT OF HIS SECTION IMMEDIATELY. | His teaching style is superb. Does numerous examples and asks the class if he should do more examples. Goes over everything thoroughly. Material on tests is not a surprise - you know what's gonna come. His accent can be hard to get used to in the first few classes, but he clarifies well on the board. Tough subject, but genuinely good teacher. | Superb! | Awful professor, very condescending, rude, not very helpful, could barely understand him. | I did poorly on mid-term 1 in Math 421, but Prof. Chanillo really helped me a lot in office hours. One on one he is very patient and encouraging. He also gave out a checklist, a sample final and held a 2 hour review session. You need to be mature to take this class, and you have to be serious. I got a B overall in the course. | He's a great lecturer and teaches the material very well. His exams are extremely difficult compared to any other Calc V class. Averages were in the 40's. He puts on ridiculous complicating problems on the exam, stuff never covered in class or in the homework and expects to figure it out on your own. STRONGLY RECOMMEND going to an easier teacher. | Worst professor I've ever had. He's extremely unfair and his grading is very harsh. He makes you feel stupid when you don't know something and makes sarcastic remarks to his students. His exams are insanely hard and our averages were about 30 points lower than averages in other calc 5 classes. Do yourself a favor and switch out immediately! | This man is the first professor ive taken who truly exemplifies academia. He will push to learn, send you a flurry of emails reinforcing the material, and yes he may crack a joke when someone asks something without thinking. Class is much harder than most other Calc V classes, but totally worth it regardless of the final grade. | This course is hard, but Chanillo tries his best. The textbook isn't great, and his boardwork is meh, and that's where most of the difficulty lies. But if you go to this guy for help he's very willing to take the time to explain stuff to you. Also a funny guy. (Everyone who felt offended by him in class, swallow your ego and pipe down.) | Not too helpful in making sure students understand material. Its hard to straighten out things that you don't understand the first time, so pay attention and study with a friend. He is not too good at answering questions, but he is a nice guy. I do not recommend this professor. | Not that hard of a class. Just do the hw problems and you will be alright. I barely went to class and I would just study the day before and did pretty decent...However, he needs to work on his attitude. Everyone is scared to ask questions in class because he usually responds with, ""ITS OBVIOUS! HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE IT.."" and then he'll try to explai | As far as I know, he is a good teacher(just for Math250). He makes u understand how the material you have learned is used in real world. | his exams are difficult. if u do ur work, try, and come to class u can do well. | Impossibly hard, yes, but not a terrible teacher. Tests were largely proof-based (even the problems that seem like computation require a proof!--remember this!) and doing well in 300 and 250 does not mean you will do well in his 350. It seems as though he does curve, however; so just be better than the average. | This guys terrible. All he does is stand up, quickly go through the proofs and says every step is ""obvious."" You can't assume the grader knows anything for his exams and he takes off points everywhere. Kinda arrogant and constantly says ""This isn't Math 250, you have to show your work."" blah blah blah. Avoid at all costs, I hated him. | he makes you feel really stupid if you ask questions, and then gets mad when students dont ask any questions. definitely ask your TA if you have questions, not him. | I went to classes when I could but didnt usually last the entire 80minutes. Hope you get a good TA and go to tutoring or something. You wonted be able to pass this class on lecture alone. Math blows in general, so the chances of anyone liking any calc teacher is slim to none. | wow this is the most F'd up proff. he doesnt teach well. he seems to hold a grudge against high school calc teachers and constantly brings them up saying how they dont know****. DO NOT ever raise your hand in the class and ask him a question bcuz he will make you feel so stupid. he doesnt help at all. if you can get out of this class get out! | Worst teacher at Rutgers. He assigns many hw problems and doesn't tell you which ones are going to be graded. Exams are extremely difficult(class got 20s on 2nd exam). He has ZERO compassion for students. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with him. Switch sections immediately!! | No Comments | Typical day in class: student asks a question to better understand something, Chanillo doesn't answer (or if he does, makes student feel dumb for asking). Then complains students don't ask questions. Huh? I you're gonna take this class with him, know this: he loves to stick questions on the exams from sections in the book not done in class! | Chanillo is not a great prof but I wouldn't call him mean, arrogant, or anything like that. He does tend to get very furstrated quickly with students who are apathetic and do not pain attention during class. If students do not speak up he automatically assumes the class doesn't know. I can see if you have a hard time with math he isn't great thou | Such. A. Jerk. | Apathetic and condescending sums him up. | His tests are neither difficult nor easy. His lectures are good - you can learn everything w/out reading the book much. However, when you go for office hours to ask question or help with hw problems, he is not helpful at all. | I should have listened to others' comments. This guy is so arrogant. He is a good professor as far as his teaching goes, but you really need to class to be able to follow what is going on. However he is a total jerk when it comes to asking any questions. he just makes you feel stupid. | this guy is so cocky and mean. dont ever ask questions in his class he'll try and make you feel dumb. transfer from his class | I don't know what experiences other people rating him had with him. However, he is great in teaching I have never looked for outside help for math 252. Actually, he makes everything clear for you. | Whoa! Evil man. He won't help you and has an awful attitude. If you get him...drop him, do not pass go...do not collect$200..immediately register for another section!!! | No Comments | This guy is extremely unhelpful and needs an attitude adjustment. I should have listened when I heard ""OMG, you have him?! He's the devil!"" Avoid him like the plague."
"Ma, Man Shun","He is a great professor, explained all the material well and posted all his notes online in case someone didnt understand something. He was easily accessible during office hours and went over any questions you had, even if they were on assigned homework due the same day. He was very caring aswell and gave extra credit to those who needed it. | Very boring/monotone lecturer, all you need is the textbook. If you can easily do the HW you'll be fine, and be sure to try to get pts back on your tests! | Don't have to go to lecture, just learn from/memorize the textbook and make sure you know how to do the recommended problems he often picks problems from there and puts it on exams. Easy B but if you want the A you have to put in a lot of time. Exams are straightforward. Homeworks can get tedious sometimes but not difficult. | He is a good lecturer and makes the material easy. The tests are pretty straightforward. He is really a solid choice for this course."
"Kan, Sophie","Math professors are supposed to know how to portray their ideas for the ability to solve complicated problems to their students, this professors lacks this ability to the max. I was shocked when during my workshop she gave answers to problems that seemed complicated to my group without imposing a solution route or asking any meaningful questions. | She is very approachable and responsive via email, but overall would not recommend her. lectures are mandatory (she takes attendance) and hard to follow because of her lack of technology skills, messy handwriting, disorganized notes, and thick accent. If there is any other professor that works with your schedule, take that one so you can learn | There's a review in here that says she talks to her students like she is a drill sergeant, which is such an accurate way to describe her lectures. She also told our lecture hall that she would prefer if we did not have accommodations through ODS, which is very invalidating. Not a nice professor, also there is a significant language barrier. | Her lectures are simply her scrolling through screenshots of work. She muted us in a majority of the lectures and as a result, we were not able to ask questions if we wanted to. Her lectures expected you to know how to do everything already. Her class was mainly just self-studying. Organic chemistry tutor and outside resources are why I did well. | While the class is hard, she did an excellent job explaining things and is very willing to answer questions. Her teaching took some getting used to but she is very funny and her outfits are the best. Her grading can be slightly inconsistent but when we were sent home for COVID, even with her lack of technology awareness she was helpful and clear. | never listened to a professor who teaches math worse than her. she reviews the content from the previous week for most of the class and rushes the new content at the end, leaving the class with little to no understanding of what was taught. The recitation teacher also poorly reteaches the content and quizzes on content never taught. Terrible combo! | Slow lectures, barely have finished lecture. Don't care whether the student could understand her writing and messed up structures. I don't know how hard for the school to find a good professor. | Dr. Kan is an interesting woman. She commands like a drill sergeant at times but she does care and wants you to pass. You send an attendance email each class. The lectures are tough to follow at times and you have pay attention. You need a good understanding of pre calc to fully get what she is saying. Exams are middle of the road in difficulty. | If you have questions that aren't cleared up by the end of class she will try and explain it to you and her office hours are useful. She will try and help you understand the content that is relevant on the exams, and she doesn't try to psych you out when the tests are close if you participate and go to office hours. | The most tedious courses I have ever attended. With the strong accent, it is difficult for me to understand what she said. The quality of the lecture is terrible. You can not learn anything useful for your tests or homework from her. Be prepare for teaching yourself by watching tons of Youtube Maths videos. | She acted really kind and caring in the beginning of the semester but she really did not explain enough problems and would not answer questions if she had passed the problem that she explained. | If you can avoid it, don't take her. You can tell she is honestly trying to teach, but her accent can be difficult and her tests are stupidly tough. If you know Precalc well, you should be okay, but otherwise... it's a big risk to take her. | She's a nice lady and tries to help you if your struggling but the class is just tough and you usually end up teaching yourself. I failed her precalc 111 along with several other students. We all took precalc before but here its a whole different subject and I don't think she explains it clearly. | Dr. Kan is a kind professor that cares for her students and wants them all to succeed. However, she isn't the best professor to teach the material. I self-taught myself a lot of the coursework because she doesn't address problems in class. The exams are quite difficult although she curves it well. | Prof Kan's lectures are literally just sample problems over and over. She does curve exams but one sample problem per topic just isn't enough sometimes. Lots of homework SO MAKE SURE YOU DO IT. The homework problems are always a lot easier than the exams though. | She is very nice and very lenient grader. Although I realized that she is not as thourough in her teachings as some other professors over here. I did well on the final because I went to other professors' reviews. | Professor Kan truly does want her students to pass. She grades very leniently however, if you have never taken calc before I suggest finding a difference professor. I never took calc until this class and found that Professor Kan assumes that most people already have had experience with calc. Very nice lady, attendance only accounts for 25 points. | Dr. Kan is a very nice lady who clearly cares about her students. She wants you to pass and tells you the same on the first day. Although her lectures are filled with proofs and examples instead of actual teaching of the material, she loves questions and is willing to meet with you anytime she is available. You should take notes in class. | Dr. Kan is very knowledgable in her lectures & takes the time to make sure everyone understand the topic before moving on. The class is as easy as calc can be. If you understand the materials taught in class you won't even have to open up the book. | Dr Kan is nice and all but she is not too good of a calc professor. You basically have to teach yourself the material because you wouldn't understand it in lectures. she also takes attendance. the course is not easy but not super hard too. | Very good professor as Rutgers Calc professors go. Helpful at office hours and cares about math. She will give out extra credit for participation. Her two midterms are decent and she also takes attendance (although its worth only 25pts out of 650, 1 for each lecture) | Her exams are fair. Most problems are ridiculously easy but do expect a couple of problems to be hard. Great lecturer. TAKE NOTES and study from those for the exams. She hates when people skip class so if few people show up, she'll give extra credit points. | not clarify | Dr. Sophie Kan is truly a great professor, she cares for the students and wants everybody to understand the material. She has an accent but it's still easy to understand her, for me at least. I had her for Calc I and she makes the proofs make sense and her teaching style is very easy to pick up on, plus she has a great sense of humor. TAKE HER! | she's a really sweet person and genuinely loves math. she also really cares about her student and if you go to office hours and show that you're trying to understand, she'll factor that in. i didn't take calc or precalc in high school however, so this class extremely difficult; if you've taken calcap calc in highschool, itll be a breeze | She was the best professor I had in my freshman year. Her lectures were interesting and helpful. She made jokes sometimes, and even gave extra credit for participation. If you go to her lectures and do your homework, you'll be fine. She is not super easy, but she's not hard either."
"Salamon, Joshua","Extremely funny and clearly plans his lectures very well and makes the class entertaining. His lectures are very fun and taking the course with him is like a roller coaster experience: full of twists and fun. | Funny lectures. Class was disorganized due to Jewish holidays however that seems to only apply to Fall 2024 semester. Professor cares about class and is responsive to emails and questions. Exams were fair, pay attention to lectures. Gives free points + HW is free. Study hard though, some concepts can get abstract. | Overall a great, funny, and kind professor. He made the class fun by giving funny and sarcastic jokes, but remember that this course is not easy, and you MUST pay attention and understand all the lessons. However, he explains the concepts in the easiest way possible, so just pay attention. This is my favorite class I have taken, very interesting! | I had him for 486, 487, and 488. The material can be a bit challenging at times, but he explains everything so well. He takes his time covering the material which I do not mind, but sometimes can be boring. He always does reviews in class before an exam which helps a lot. He only assigns 5-6 homework and lets you resubmit for a better grade. | Professor Salamon is a great lecturer and gives clear examples that apply the material to real life. I took his Math 285 class last semester. His teaching and lectures helped me pass SOA exam FM (combined with extra studying outside class). I definitely plan to take him again in the future. I highly recommend his classes in the actuarial program! | This is the actuarial class to take if you are interested the field. It covers the long term part of SOA exam FAM. He is a wonderful lecturer and the exams are not meant to trick you, especially if you show up to lecture. His lecturers are very informative and enjoyable. Plus he is very passionate about the material! | 486 and 487 are consecutive for SOA, whereas only 487 count for major requirements. I really enjoy his teaching style, and this is the fourth semester took his class. He is patient. If you have any questions, don't hesitate and ask after lectures. | The third semester with this prof, the advisor of actuarial program. This course is for SOA. He always gave the review section before exams. Make sure go to these lectures. | Actuaty track. I took his 477 and this course, as always a very chill professor, and enjoyed his lecture -- straight forward and easy to understand, reasonable grading. | I often ask him questions after class, and he always patiently explains. The professor taught at a particularly high level, which is probably why his lectures were considered relatively simple. He is also a professor of actuarial science; if you are also in this direction, please choose his course. He will also cover the SOA exam-related content. | Good professor. Former actuary. Knows and is passionate about the material. Gives real life examples. Funny. Fair grader. Fun problems in and out of class. | Professor Joshua Salamon excels in teaching financial math. He simplifies complex concepts, making classes engaging and actually very fun. His real-world approach nurtures deep understanding, ensuring student success. He is also really frickin funny which makes the class even more enjoyable. I'd highly recommend, especially for actuarial students. | Professor Joshua Salamon is a standout in probability education. He simplifies complex concepts, fosters inclusive learning, and goes beyond, ensuring student success. His engaging teaching style and dedication inspire a profound understanding of the subject. Plus he has an amazing sense of humor. | Professor Salamon is the best professor at Rutgers, and anyone who takes an upper level math class with him will probably agree. I have had him as a professor for 2 classes, both 400 level, and he provided the best educational experience for all his students. If you see a class, with him as the professor, take it!!! | His lectures weren't always very clear but he wasn't a bad professor by any means. There were two separate occasions when he cancelled class while everyone was in the room waiting for him. One class he made up over zoom on a Sunday night and the other one he made up on Thanksgiving day. These lectures were recorded but it was still very annoying. | *Math106. He is unmotivated, unenthusiastic, and very confusing. He had to miss many classes for religious holidays in Sept. and said these lectures ""were a problem for later."" Now we are in the final weeks and have 3 2-hour lectures starting at 8 or 9 pm on weekends or the night before Thanksgiving and HW assignments due every night on final days. | Had him for math106 but the course code isn't listed and it was miserable. Often went on tangents about content related to a higher level math course and was extremely confusing to a lot of our class. Seemed to not really care about teaching us the content and would often blow off confused students or be extremely condescending. Take Arias instead. | The best Professor I've had at Rutgers! I took 285, 486, and 487. He is knowledgeable about the actuarial field and is a good resource to have for questions about exams or internships. Lectures are important to understand the material but he makes them entertaining! If you do the homework and go to lectures and study for exams, you'll be fine! | Salamon is hilarious and a really nice guy. He does an okay job with teaching the 285 material. It helps build the fundamentals if you plan to take Exam FM. I took an online course to help me prep for that exam while taking 285 and with those together I passed. Tests were pretty easy, HWs could be difficult but there was no set due date for them. | I would highly recommend going to class because the textbook is really not needed for this class. His lectures are quite easy to understand and he teaches in a way that makes it entertaining. His exams are very fair and I would definitely take him again for another course. | Took 285,477,486, and 487 with him and enjoyed all 4. He exposes you to a lot of good material but focused exams more on the core concepts. Only gives a few short homeworks the whole semester. Hes the one math professor whose lectures I really enjoy sitting through. You should take him if you have the chance. | Cool sense of humor, class is fine, lays to you all the foundations of probability. HW is a free 20%, but the exams can be hit or miss because the grading is a bit too strict. | A nice professor, who is an above average lecturer, but gives very straight forward exams. There are no curve balls in his class, and he wants his students to succeed. Homework is worth 20% of the grade, but is very minimal, and students have the opportunity to resubmit. In other words, that large 20% chunk is guaranteed. | Midterms are very easy! His review right before the midterm will basically have the same questions that you will see on the midterm. If you have taken calc prior to this class, its very manageable. | Also had him for 477. You won't need the textbook really but it can help reading through it and if you choose to do the practice problems he assigns Fairly easy course and layback professor. He gives about 7 or 8 HW which you can submit, get wrong, and resubmit for full credit if you correct your mistakes Tests are like practice exams, but study | Hard to understand and rushes through the material. Don't buy the textbook bc you can get webassign by itseself. No point in going to lecture. Luckily my TA was great and taught everything in recitation so I did ok in the class. I took calc in hs but if this is your first time taking calc take someone else. | If you are taking 478 after him, you won't be prepared. He is making the class too light for 400 level. | If you need an easy class take him. If you are taking 478, 481 or 485 after I strongly recommend not to or you will have a lot to catch up. | If you show up to lecture, he clearly explains what needs to be known. Gives examples of how things are done. Some people are giving bad reviews since the class doesn't adequately prepare you for actuarial exams. Don't listen to them, he has a great ability to teach | Very nice and very easy. Homework is usually 2 basic problems. If you are planning to take actuary exams, I recommend somebody else. If you need an easy course in your schedule, take Salamon. If you are planning to take Math 478 after, I definitely choose smb else for 477, as Beck won't be a different story in terms of difficulty. | Everybody complains that he doesn't prepare you for the actuarial exam but he is not there for that. The class is not a test prep and he said in the beginning. However, after taking his class people interested in taking the exam would have a solid understanding of the basics and would just need to practice harder problems on their own. | If you are planning to take actuary exams, I would advise against him. He is coming from the field, but his class won't prepare you even for the first exam. You will have to study a lot yourself. If you are interested in credit only, he is ok. | He explains really well and makes probability, which is a relatively hard subject, understandable. He is an actuary by profession so he gives a lot of past actuarial questions for homework, however, he tends to be a bit easier than the actual exam so if you are planning to take that prepare to study on your own."
"Carbone, Lisa","This class let me down. I thought as the honors section, we would cover more interesting, abstract things, but we skipped a lot of stuff (like dual spaces). Also, sometimes she graded looking specifically for a solution she had in mind, and other methods would lose points. It was an okay class, but things could've been a lot better. | Teached important material too late in the class and rushed through it when other classes learned it in the beginning. I think she rushed an important section. If you want to really learn and can take the honors section take it | Professor Carbone is a great lecturer and because of this I believe my notebook from this class will become an excellent resource for proof writing in the future. However the grading is cut throat with a single midterm at 20% and an 8 question final at 50% of entire grade there isnt much room for growth in the class from possible missteps. | Took this class with her this semester, excellent choice. Although she could come off a bit cold, and doesn't offer much office hours, she explains very well and the exams are very easy. Definitely the best choice for math 300! | She is a decent lecturer. Homework questions are tough, and does few examples in class. If you ask her a question about your overall grade, midterm average she will respond she doesn't know, which doesn't help students understand where they stand in the class. | She's the best professor I had from the math department. She is strict, detailed, and articulate. The material itself can be challenging (especially in the beginning). I loved how she actually knew everyone of our names in class. After each class, she sends you an email containing all her notes which is extremely helpful. Her accent is awesome btw. | She's a decent lecturer, but cam be very cold and strict about things. She goes through lots of examples and the homeworks/in-class workshops prepare you pretty well for exams. Just make sure to put your cell phone away and don't get caught with it if you must use it. | She doesn't know how to solve a problem sometimes. Sometimes it is just like ""um... um..."" and her mind is disconnected. Do not take her class because she is too serious, only want you to use the way she wants to solve but her methods are messy and are not fixed. It is just like coming up from her mind suddenly. | I heard Math300 is one of the hardest math class out there! Her homework assignment does not come from the textbook. Lots of notes to take in class, but in emails typed notes before midterm and finals. During midterm we had 7 mins per problem. | Bad - Only wants her proofs done the way she wants them. If you're a creative proof writer, don't take this class. Good lecturer, but takes off for stupid reasons on homework and sometimes doesn't give effective instructions. | Don't let my rating turn you away from taking her. She assigns homework with plenty of notice ahead of time, so while they can sometimes be difficult, you have plenty of time to do them. Attendance is a must because she rarely invokes the textbook in her notes and doesn't send her notes out usually. She's a bit intimidating but truly cares. | Carbone is a very good professor. Her exams are difficult but doable. I recommend her for MATH300 | Eloquent and sophisticated lecturer. But you have to listen carefully and TAKE NOTES, she does not use the book. She seems to know a lot beyond the course material. Exams were hard but I was happy with my grade. | do all homeworks. make sure you keep you cell phone off. you will be fine. just make sure you pay attention more to her lectures than the book. she makes her own problems | She really cares about the material which is a plus; she goes out of her way to make the course interesting and appealing. If you like math even a little, you need to take her. She is great! Here is the key: go to class, do your homework, go to office hours and you will learn a lot! Oh and DO NOT FORGET TO MIND YOUR MANNERS! | Take her for MATH 300. She is easy and she is British. Just study her notes and examples, the exams are like her quizzes and hw. She is the easiest professor to teach Math 300 if you want a good grade! But do not argue with her, just always nodd your head. | No lisa, I don't believe in the principal of mathematical induction the way you described it. Look, all i'm saying is on my way to class today i saw 2 red horses. And by your logic that means that all horses are red now. | Prof. Carbone is awesome! She is a great instructor, and good-looking as well. As for the course itself, the workload is not hard at all and Prof. Carbone makes the class easy (tho I suspect that her section may be easier than others). Definitely try to take her for Math 300. | you don't wanna argue with her when it comes to a proof. she might get a little defensive. don't ask her to do you a favour, she acts like she's too hot for that. grading is not so fair. however, the workload is not bad and this class was easy. | Once in a lifetime does a Professor like Lisa Carbone come along. She is a trailblazer in a man's world. She has multiplied my enjoyment of math. She has added appeal to the subject. She has subtracted my angst about university life. I am not divided at all. | How can I say this...STAY AWAY!!! She was so mean when you asked questions in class!! and actually humiliated students in class. She goes through the material way too fast!!! | I think she is Awesome! At the beginning of the semester, she can seem intimidating, but she is very fair, and very helpful! Pay attention in class. I think her explanation is a lot better than the book. I highy recommend her for this course!!!!! | She was a great teacher. I failed 300 with my previous teacher and managed a B with her. She was much clearer and very helpful. She even wrote me a letter of recommendation for the education program. | Very nice teacher, although she does get moody... she is mad easy though and I didn't feel she taught me as amuch in Math 300 when compared to the other horror stories I heard about Math 300... Overall, she is bearable and she speaks British English too! Tea and crumpets! | You can learn a lot from her if you really attend class and follow her, but her exams are brutal. She cares a lot that students learn and she knows her stuff. Overall a good class. | Very effective professor but hard to find her outside of class. Excellent lectures. | Good class, sometimes hard, but fair. | Not an effective instructor. Teaches much less than other math 300 instructors. Avoid her class at all costs. | She doesnt really know what shes talking about; some of us knew more than she did. She's really easy though. Second exam was tough but first and final were easy. | Lisa is very nice and helpful and really cares a lot. Her classes are definately boring though. | Lisa is a good professor. The material is usually clear in class. Office hours weren't very helpful, but the class wasn't too bad. Exams and homeworks were fair. Quizes were also good. Lisa is also very hot ;) Take the calss, you'll come out with a lot...She's probably one of the best you can have for this course, from what I've heard. | One of the best math professors I have had so far | Tough, but very clear; genuinely cares that you understand the material; handwriting can get too flowery though - but readable. Great professor! | Nice teacher who always tries her best for her students. I like her... and she speaks ENGLISH! :-) | Very thorough teacher, great explanations, caring woman, you couldnt ask for more! | She is an okay teacher. That's it. Class is very boring and directly out of the book. She gives harder exams than any other calc 2 152 teacher. | Ehh... take someone else | Professor Carbone is an average teacher. She doesn't believe in a curve, and does examples straight from the book. Also, her interaction with the TA is very poor. I didn't like her at all. | No Comments | Great teacher. Very clear and organized. A whole lotta homework though. I spend hours and hours on it and it's not all that helpful. All the classes do basically the same hw though. | Very nice and approachable teacher. One of the best math teachers. She seems to be a real person, not a machine like other math professors. Take her class. | She's a nice lady, but her her explanations confuse her and the class. When students ask FUNDAMENTAL questions, she usually has to try to figure out the answer herself. Her curriculum flowed very nicely, but she left out too much course material."
"Molnar, David","Math 251 with Professor Molnar is no easy feat, but his engaging lectures and challenging workshops pay off. The exams are tough, but with the help of unstuck AI and a committed work ethic, you can succeed. Definitely worth the effort. | Good lecturer and was very helpful when answering student questions. Lecture attendance not mandatory, although I would strongly recommend it. Recitation attendance is mandatory due to having weekly quizzes. Towards the end the material gets challenging, but Molnar makes sure you understand what exactly you need to do depending on the question. | Calculus 3 is fairly straightforward until the last chapter (and to be fair I hadn't attended the lectures for those sections, I just read the textbook). Professor Molnar taught calc 3 with a high level of clarity, provided good lecture slides, and I found the pearson homework, while tedious, to be helpful. If you were fine in calc 1, you'll be ok. | You have to work hard to earn a decent grade in his class. He is an incredibly tough grader and makes his exams significantly harder compared to other professors'. His lectures move fast and workshops are due the next day, so you have hardly any time to complete them. Entertaining professor, but hard to pass. | David Molnar is the GOAT for Calculus 3 because he makes complex topics like multivariable calculus and vector fields clear and engaging. His step-by-step explanations and practical examples build confidence, while his dedication to helping students succeed—through extra support and encouragement—fosters a deep love for math. | tough grader, but funny and very willing to help if you reach out to him outside of class. you have to work pretty hard for your grade and going to lectures makes the class much more manageable, but molnar is one of the most honest and helpful profs i've ever had | I'll be straightforward; his exams are brutal.He does prepare ample practice materials so they are *technically* doable, but the amount of time you spend doing them is a little bit nuts. I wouldn't outright recommend him but I wouldn't say to avoid him either; if you need to take his class, go for it,but be prepared to make a large time commitment | Awesome professor. Great teaching style and very easy to understand. Super accessible and truly wants you to understand the material. Class is difficult but its the material and he makes it as easy as he can with his explanation. If you go to lecture and actually listen to him, you will do well. | Extremely tough class. Lectures were very confusing. Prof is really not very flexible. Dreaded going to this class all semester long. If I could rate a zero I would. Do not recommend at all | Very cool class. | He grades incredibly hard and also makes his exams incredibly hard. His lectures move really fast and he makes workshops due the next day, so you have hardly any time to complete them. He's also just rude and doesn't particularly care about his students. Very rude emails and very few extra resources. | Professor Molnar is very knowledgeable and has good explanations for the students' questions. However, he makes his tests extremely difficult, which requires lots and lots of studying. He also makes workshops due the next day and doesn't teach some things on there, so be prepared to contribute a significant amount of time everyday to his class. | His tests and quizzes are way harder and lectures move faster than other professors(including honors section). His lectures create an atmosphere that discourages asking questions by embarrassing students who do ask. He often gives rude/sarcastic responses to legitimate questions. He is easily angered and yells at students. This man is heartless. | Extremely tough professor. Exams, quizzes and workshops are all brutal. Has an insane curve however. His lectures are alright if a little boring. He is responsive to emails. Not worth the mental toll or effort compared to other 251 professors. | actually the most useless professor I have ever had. I hate him and his iced tea that he walks in every class. I forgot an '=' sign and lost 4 points. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS RIGHT. no partial credit and there is double jeopardy (if you get part a. wrong and use part a. for part b. then part b. is wrong). | Very difficult class. He's pretty average as far as lectures go. I wish he provided more resources to get a better understanding of the more difficult topics | While Math 251 is notoriously challenging, particularly the last third of the material, I found that Molnar explained the topics well. The workshops and quizzes he gave were relatively challenging but his exams were more straightforward. | I HATED THIS CLASS. HE TAUGHT NOTHING. HE JUST READ OFF OF THE SLIDES. I CANNOT. THE FINAL WAS AWFUL. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU WANT TO GET AN A AND KEEP YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. | DM makes Calc at Rutgers interesting with his sense of humor and the jar. But seriously he is really good I would recommend. | Inspirational. Respected. Hilarious. These three words describe Professor Molnar to a T. Prof. Molnar didn't just teach - he ignited a new passion for my studies. If you need a prof who will inspire you, challenge you, and change the way you see the world, look no further. This isn't just a class - it's Professor Molnar's investment in your future. | DM is a great guy. The course material was tough but he manages to make it digestible. That being said, Calc2 is still a very hard class so you should still study on your own. DM's office hours are great for this since he can help you understand concepts that might not have been best explained during lecture. Would definitely take him again. | Molnar is a great lecturer but his section is extremely difficult. He grades very harshly and the midterms are much more difficult than other sections. This does prepare you for the final and he curves in order to account for the added difficulty. I ended with a 68 which was considered a B. Also, this is a class you should 100% go to lecture for. | Good professor overall; if you go to most of his lectures, you will be well prepared for the exams. Most problems on the 3 midterms and the final were doable with the exception of a couple hard ones. If you do the online HW problems on Pearson, textbook problems, and practice exams from previous years, you should be able to get at least a B. | Prof Molnar is a fun, incredibly smart teacher. He will make proofwriting less abstract and more straightforward. It is certainly challenging and demanding but practice and learn from the feedback on exams and quizzes. quizzes are like workshops, but exams can be a bit more strategic (note that I didn't say difficult). | David Molnar was an amazing professor. | Very good Professor, has a funny sense of humor and teaches very well. He is a tough grader on tests. | Seems like a nice guy with a good disposition; he's fine in person, but on Zoom, he is plain boring. Half of his jokes are funny but none of them are beyond surface level laughs. I ended up patching up my understanding with online videos. Overall, it was a fine class. I wouldn't mind taking another class with him, but I wouldn't seek it out either. | W professor round 2 | Molnar is a pretty good lecturer, he explained the topics in a very straightforward way, even though he did go off on some tangents in a few lectures. You do have to put in the work to do well in this class. Make sure you know how to do EVERY PROBLEM from workshops and lectures before exams. | W professor | Professor Molnar is a good professor with straight forward exams. He will give you extra study material and has a good teaching style. Lectures focus on practice problems. | Prof Molnar is one of the greatest math instructors I have ever had in my entire life. His humor really added to the lectures and although this class required a lot of work I always felt that the recitations were based on things that we directly learned in lecture. The final was easier than his midterms, which were based on textbook problems. | A tough professor but his lectures were not terrible. He does not post his notes so if you dont go to class you are screwed unless you know someone who will send you the notes. The exams are pretty impossible. The quizzes suck so be ready to fail those half the time. Study hard for exams and make sure you are doing textbook problems. good luck lol | Hes a great prof. He explains the material well in his lectures and answers questions with the perfect responce. He is funny and almost acts like a clown a bit. Not in a negative way. However, u gotta review the material every day cause u will forget it. Recitation is a lot of work tho, hw takes a while. Excellent prof but a lot of work | I did not mind Professor Molnar, his weekly quizzes were not that bad if you understood the material, I really liked his lectures he was a funny guy. His tests were alright, the review material was decent practice. You should do the recommended problems he gives during lectures that helped a lot while studying. Overall, great professor. | 251 is a hard class, but Molnar is a funny guy and a pretty good lecturer. He is helpful in office hours. He gives you many resources to succeed, especially practice exams. His weekly quizzes were of medium difficulty. He also gave practice problems in recitation, but they were harder than anything else. Overall cool guy. Just don't fall behind. | My biggest issue was the fact that what he taught was completely different from the recitations and exams. The lectures were completely useless. I studied from all the resources he gave me for the exams and still did poorly. He skips over crucial parts in the lessons assuming its already common knowledge. | I usually worked on homework and some assignments with a group because it was hard to do it on your own. His exams were difficult to the point where I would silently cry and submit the test. Averages were usually in the 40s but at the end the cutoffs were fair. Lectures were boring and he was a difficult person to get along with. | A dry teaching style, lectures are wholly comprised of examples rather than introducing topics and concepts first before applying them. Hard to contact outside of lectures, requires matlab assignments without introducing the program/how to use it ""dont ask me about matlab, i dont use it"" and provided another professors notes on the topic instead | Diff Eq with Molnar is a tough class - but I think that's mainly because there's no mandatory homework compared to Calcs 1-3. You need to practice on your own with the recitation sets (which are hard) and textbook problems, and then you'll be set. He is tough when giving partial credit on exams. Most of the practice material doesn't have solutions | My favorite prof of all time period | Professor Molnar was a relatively average professor, leaning towards the better side. Although his lectures were rather slow and dry, he strictly tests on lecture material covered. He has a rather unorthodox way of teaching that works with some, but annoys a few. Unfortunately he doesn't post practice exam or worksheet answers. | This professor is an absolute clown. Not only does he have a severe attitude problem, but he should not be teaching. He doesn't post the solutions to practice exams and isn't clear about problems that will be on tests. The tests themselves are hard and go over content which he barely does. I don't know how or why this man still has a job. | I took Molnar for both Calc 251 and 244 and really liked his classes. He tried to get people involved in the online space and made the material fun to learn through amusing questions. While his class was by no means easy, he is great at explaining and a really good option for a good, hard class. | You get failed, the professor still considers you cheat. | Seriously would not recommend. If you like passive aggressive emails, and monotone lectures this is your guy. Ask those at Rutgers and I'm sure they'll heard a story about him.. not in a good way. If Molnar is the only section available, get an spn. By far the worst math professor I have had at Rutgers, he's just not a nice guy. DO NOT RECCOMEND!! | His humor is dry and sarcastic which is absolute gold to me. His lectures can be a bit dry so I mostly relied on the textbook and then quickly going through the recorded lectures. The best part of him is that he clearly wants his students to succeed. His office hours are great and he makes sure you have plenty of resources. | He made a very time-consuming class a little less tedious than it could have been. His lectures are entertaining, and while I wish he had enough time to go over proofs in the latter half of the semester, the ones he did do were very interesting. His weekly quizzes were occasionally difficult, but usually fairly reflected that week's lesson. | I dont understand why people rated him so low. He is a great professor and I really like his lecture. It was fun and helpful. If you do what he tells you to do your grades should be garenteed above B | The class worked well, despite the fact that I took it online. Professor Molnar has a good sense of humor and makes class entertaining. There wasn't that much time for going over a ton of examples or the proofs that support the concepts, especially towards the end of the class, but it's enough to work with. Very prompt in responding to emails. | he takes the whole semester to grade your exams so you dont even know how youre doing until the end. theres homework due like every other day and its a lot at a time, but it isnt worth much of your grade. most of your grade is just the exams and quizzes. his quizzes are also way harder than other profs. he is also snarky when you ask questions :/ | He is so mean and did not give you any extra opportunities to improve your performance. | When we switched to online, it went a lot harder. The lectures are boring and non - interactive, very monotonous. The tests and quizzes were unnecessarily hard and they did not take into account any students having issues from the pandemic. The course was harder than it needed to be and left me, as a student, feeling horrible, like I knew nothing. | Molnar was my favorite professor this semester. He makes his own notes and interacts with the class through chat a lot. The material is hard, but Molnar at least made it a little fun to learn. He adapted to online very well. His quizzes can be a little difficult. You need to work for the exams, but it is def not extremely difficult to do well. | sadly can't really say he was that helpful- didn't transition well to online (though that can be attributed to the math dept), didn't provide answers to practice exams while other professors did, didn't seem enthusiastic about teaching, long delay on returning grades. found myself making more progress from textbook or online. also kind of snippy | It is a hard class. Molnar is a decent lecturer and knows material well. But, his exams, which this time was written by the entire math board, are necessarily hard for no reason. Unless you are a TA or Professor, the exams kill you. The curve helps unless you got killed early on. The exam averages up to this date is a C, which curves to B- maybe | Doesn't teach and gets super lazy when we ask questions. | He made the material way harder than it needed to be, and he knew it since he gave such a big curve. I never really knew how I was doing in the class until the end. Failed almost all the quizzes, Canvas said I was getting a D, but pulled a B+. The transition to online was pretty rough, but I liked him overall. It was just a tough course. | I really disliked him as a person. He has this condescending tone and his ""humor"" isn't funny at all. He also doesn't really cared about the way you write proofs. If you need to take 300, I really recommend Saks or Komlos if you can get to the Honors section. I am in the Honors program but had to take the course with Molnar to accelerate my degree. | I had Professor Molnar for differential equations last summer. I really enjoyed his lectures; he explained everything clearly and concisely. Homework was optional but the problems were helpful and he would go over any questions the next day in class. Tests were fair. Probably one of the best math professors I've had. | His tests are difficult but definitely passable as long as you keep up with the homework and take the time to understand the concepts. He's quite funny and his lectures are very helpful to understand difficult topics. | His class is really difficult, but a nice person | He's extremely difficult but if you try, you can get a good grade. Good curve at the end. | amazing class ! took differentials with him over summer and learned a lot. he gives you a quiz outline with what will be on each quiz and there was no online homework- which motivates you to do the problems yourself. he tries to have fun and the exams are hard but theres always a chance for redemption as you can earn extra points on the exams. | Don't recommend him if you want a rigorous teaching. Molnar likes to choose some ""interesting"" problems but he doesn't teach the main material thoroughly. I felt like a friend of mine who had a different prof for the same class was taught better. Also, Molnar had limited office hours/wasn't really interested in talking to me about math :( | A good teacher, but quizzes and tests are harder compared to other 244 classes. | If you have option, choose that option and thank me later. His teaching style is not the best. | I didn't like his class. It looked like he was bored teaching the same material over and over. I also feel like he was more interested in making workshop problems than actually teach students to solve them. Finally, his sense of humor is quite... specific... meaning it wasn't funny... at all. | Professor Molnar was great and explained things clearly, I learned a great deal from him. HOWEVER, his exams are EXTREMELY hard and you have to work really hard to do well. | Professor Molnar is the best Math professor I have ever had. i took him for both Calc 2 & 3. he's really funny and holds interesting lectures and is willing to help his students. ask him questions if you do not understand anything because he's clarifies stuff better if for you ask. his exams are fair if you study and do his practice problems."
"Sussmann, Hector","Took this 2019 Spring. I still have PTSD. Avoid this professor. He doesn't provide you with intuition on what you are actually doing, and isn't clear on explaining how he jumps to particular conclusions. For an intro to proof class, this is detrimental to a students learning. Didn't see a proper proof until 311-he doesn't show them in class. AVOID! | He's just down right cruel with his correcting, its like he expects people to already know the material, i got a 100 1rst exam and a 84 the 2nd but it was extremly stressful and DONT TAKE HIM UNLESS U LIKE GETTING TOLD UR AN IDIOT EVERYDAY | Avoid this professor | Professor Sussman is a very rigorous lecturer and grader. It is not an easy class. The averages for the midterms were very low, but he will curve. The exams are designed so you can't finish all the problems, so work on the ones you can do quickly first. The most important thing is to do the homework every week, it is worth a lot of your grade | Just drop the class between due date, you won't pass. Tons of homework and tons of note. The exams are fair but his grating is so strict. If you didn't follow his instructions to solve the problems, you will get no points even though you get the right answer and procedure. DO NOT TAKE. | He is a tough professor, but fair. He teaches the material very thoroughly, but you can't afford to skip class. You also need to keep up with the homework which he gives every week and is worth like 30% of your grade. Overall, he is a good professor, but only take him if you are willing to put the work and actually learn. | Totally love him. He is very strict with the logic. He is a mathematician. His course is challenging! He is very willing to answer any question you ask. | Professor Sussmann loves math. This course Is the gateway to higher level mathematics, naturally this course should be very tough. He makes sure by the end of the course that you can write a well thought out and concise formal proof. He is definitely very tough and can be assertive, but if you apply yourself and ask for his help, you can succeed. | All these comments are correct, but he is a good professor if you really approach to him. He scolds, this is true, since some stuffs are very obvious. He will tell you wrong, wrong , and wrong, but he wants you to think more about that since Math 300 is a serious course. If you send him an e-mail, then he will respond you a very complete answer. | 64 on first exam. 35 on second exam. Got an A. Was told I would be lucky to get a C. The only reason I was passing was ""not because I was doing well but because everyone else was doing terrible."" His overall rating is ACCURATE. He also scolds his students. Don't particpate you will be just told you're wrong anyway. | Sussman is probably one of the worst professors Rutgers has to offer. He's condescending and belittling, and his teaching style involves more talking down to his class than explaining math. He is a harsh grader, and everything from ""chewing gum"", ""writing your name too small"" and ""leaving the frilly stuff on the edge of the paper"" annoys him. AVOID | How in the world is this guy a teacher? Impossible to understand accent, extremely bad at teaching the material, and very condescending towards students who ask questions. How he fails to meet any of the criteria is beyond me, and how he is a professor since 1970 baffles my mind. God bless to anyone who has him as a teacher (PROTIP: DON'T.). | Hw is extremely difficult, he is of almost no help if you go to office hours. He will just tell you you are wrong, wrong, wrong, and doesn't tell you what is right. His teaching method is VERY ineffective. Book is incomprehensible. He gives proofs ZERO points if the SLIGHTEST detail is off by a word. I have never had a worse prof in my life. | FIRST F EVER. NEVER EVEN HAD A D | had him for 300 and it was really difficult. Luckily, I read all these comments beforehand and was well prepared, so I received an A. He's tough and you have to earn his respect, but if you show a strong interest he can be very helpful. Good Luck. | He's rough and hates questions but gives some emotion to advanced classes. That's why he rants like a lunatic when you don't do things exactly his way. Prepare for the worst, and you'll get a nice treat slightly above one star. But, he's not so clear that class will work great- you need comfortable progress to work out with this guy. | If you get him, haha sucks for you. But seriously, its not the end of the world like the previous person said. He seems like a genius in his field, but he should NOT be teaching Calc 151. He forgets that some of us have never taken Calc! DO THE REVIEW PROBLEM SHEET, it helps alot with tests! His tests were so hard, the final looked like a JOKE. | I would never take a course with him if my life depended on it. | Tough professor, but he's not the end of the world. He has an accent, but it is manageable. If you pay attention and practice problems you should be able to do okay on the exams. | Worse professor ever. He is unclear when going stuff over in class, uses long winded confusing proofs. He prefers you use his proofs on exams and even if you use a comparable proof from the book he gives 0 credit. If you write one word that is different from his proof say for example ""let x be"" vs ""assume"" he gives 0 credit. | This guy may be the worst teacher ever. I had no idea what i go into he is so strict with the tests and everything, if you are off on one thing in a proof, the whole thing is marked wrong. I'm a math major and decided to drop this with a W to try to find any better teacher the next semester. I suggest anyone else drop this the first day. | It seems to me that the problems are not really his fault. The Textbook is the worst part of the class. It helps with nothing, and the problems in it have zero relation to the topics. Tests are not bad. HW 6 hours a week and it is worth 30%. Go to him for help, DON'T us the Text. I am a math major and didn't understand a word in the book | Worst.Professor.Ever. He expects us to write answers to an integral...IN ESSAY FORM! And took off points for no essay. He berates the students and can barely speak English. I passed the class by sitting in another section of Calc 2, and only going to Sussman's class for exams and workshops. | Horrible, incomprehensible, and demeaning professtor. Belittles people who ask questions and rants on and on about simple concepts and mental math while completely blowing over the important material. The textbook is ten times more helpful than he is. Do not take! | The worst professor I have ever seen. I agree FULLY with the other comments, the worst part is how he insists we are responsible for all material on the syllabus, but fails to teach 90% of it. Went on and on about how we were too stupid to learn some of the concepts, so he wasn't going to bother teaching them to us. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! | Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not take this man's class. Not only is he a bad teacher, but he will mock you and demean you. He will go over simple concepts repeatedly while not teaching the stuff that needs teaching. Has ability to make otherwise smart students fail exams. | Entering this class I was a math major. Class became emotionally draining with his belittling anyone who had a question. Proofs were unnecessarily complex and confusing. Granted he excels in the material, and this class is not an easy class to teach, but the degrading really got to me. I am no longer a math major. | completely unclear, demands math work and answers to be written in full sentences (with transitions). argues frequently with students about how he is right. when trying to prove someone's stupidity on a test, rants on and on with real-life situations, not math ones. heavy accent, sweats alot, big beard that looks dirty, and partially deaf. | I talked to one of the college ave tutors about this man and we proceeded to crack jokes about how terrible Sussman is for 15 minutes straight. He yells, makes no sense, gives difficult tests, and is no help at all. Everyone I've talked to about him hates him. I dislike the man so much that I go out of my way to warn people not to take him. | I got an A in his class but I still suggest you to switch out because his insolent attitude and cranky temper are to much to bear for a semester! He teaches very well but he does not like interacting with students a bit. The first 2 exams are horrible, but if you have them memorized for the final you are all set. worked my rear-end off and learned | the subject matter is impossible, and he doesn't make it much easier...his lectures are all over the place and doesn't correlate well with the text book...but if you try hard, and do the hw (and memorize EVERY PROOF EVER DONE!) you'll do ok. not due to him though. class isn't necessary, learn the subject elsewhere (book?). | Worse teacher for math ever. never goes over the homeworks, never gives back the homework. Test are impossible, unless you plan on dropping the rest of your classes to put all your efforts into this class, then you might pass. | The 1st few classes you may hate him, but he is one of the funnier teachers out there. HE does drill this stuff into, and although i dont know what rade i'll et i'm really enjoying the class and learning stuff. he does kinda smell if you ask him questions though | this guy sweats like a pig and smells like liquor. He rambles about things that have no relation to the course and he hates it when anyone chews gum in class!!! i passed this class but i was one of the 4 who did. transfer out if you ever see him!!! | I agree with everybody's comments. He is the TOUGHEST professor ever on earth. Bad attitude, extremely horrible exams. Although I dropped his class, but my friend who is very intelligent got an F in the class. That is the only F in his entire college life, and will remain only F for future. | NEVER EVER TAKE HIS CLASS!!!.. I REGRET TAKING HIS CLASS SOO BADLY!!!.. EVERYTHING THESE PPL SAID BOUT HIM IS SOOOOOOOOOOO TRUE!!!!.. I THINK HE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET FIRED!!!.. LET'S ALL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!.. HE SHOULD NOT BE A PROFESSOR!!!! | Horrible professor, hard exams, no calculators, absolutely not helpful in answering questions, and if try asking one he starts jumping and screaming(not a pretty picture). Basically avoid this professor!!! | He's a difficult teacher that does not follow the book and gives exams that are impossible | sussmann is the worst professor ever.. do not i repeat DO NOT take his class ever!!!!! he WILL fail u! i regret taking this class so much! | Sussman is the worst teacher ever, he makes you hate calc, he spends an entire period on the same problem, and doesnt accomplish anything useful. | teaching methods are extremely ineffective, often lectures about proper grammar and semantics rather than math. exams are extremely difficult. belligerent, hates students, unapproachable. avoid at all costs. | DO NOT TAKE SUSSMANN!!! HE LOVES TO FAIL HIS STUDENTS AND GIVE THEM A HARD TIME AS WELL!! | If you have this teacher, drop the class immediately. He loves to fail people."
"Woodward, Christopher","Woodward is a caring professor who will ensure you succeed - so long as you put effort into his class. So long as you show up, attend office hours, and take an interest in the material, he will ensure you, at the very least, pass. Provides practice problems (no solutions given but you can ask him office hours) so you know what to expect. | Prof. Woodward is a genuine and kind person. He grades fairly and makes his own notes. We did a lot practice questions in class which was nice. Exams were also similar, but not identical, to practice exams. My one complaint would be that his lectures move very quickly. Great professor. | Nice dude. Lecture is a little boring but he can be really clear if you have any question. Assignments are not hard; he give practice problems before exams and provides lots of help with them; quizzes not hard and exams are easy as long as you understand all the practice problems. | Professor Woodward is THE BEST math professor I had at Rutgers. He cares about his students and is accessible outside of classroom. Lecture is useful and easy to follow. You will learn a lot about applications of math material if you pay attention during lecture. Sample tests will be given and if you are ok with the sample you will be fine at test | I LOVE HIM! He genuinely cares about his students, something you don't really see at Rutgers. He is so sweet and is always willing to help a student out. He is not judgmental and is willing to always go over the basics with you. There are weekly quizzes and homework, and 2 midterms, but it's all similar to the practices he provides. He is a GEM!!!! | Professor Woodward genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. As long as you understand the practice exams, you will be fine for the midterm and final exams. He is also very accomodating, especially with online classes. | Professor Woodward genuinely cares about his students. His exams are based on practice exams and hes accommodating. Would definitely take him again! | Prof. Woodward was ok, he speaks and writes on the board kinda quickly but gives practice problems during class that allow you to ask questions/figure out what's happening. Not the most helpful during office hours unless you have very specific questions to clarify. Tests and problem sets were fairly straightforward, lots of repeat from Lin Alg 250. | AWESOME MATH PROFESSOR. Didn't use the textbook AT ALL, and was much clearer than the textbook. The class itself is hard but he made it more understandable, yet still difficult. Is not the best teacher ever, but definitely a great professor for this class. | Excellent professor. Made Math 300 doable. It's still a tough course but he makes things as simple as possible. Overall nice guy who just wants his students to learn. Best math professor I've had at Rutgers. Also his notes are much better than the textbook. | This was supposed to be a hard class, but he made it fairly easy and very interesting. He provides his own notes to use instead of the textbook which is great because the book is awful. Attendance is mandatory if you want to keep up with the material and do well. Office hours are very helpful. Probably one of the nicest professors I've ever had. | He is honestly a great professor. He makes this class which apparently a lot of people fail, fairly understandable and doable. He provides many examples in class and hold office hours whenever someone wants it. One thing I loves about the class is that he doesn't follow the book. He doesn't even use it. This makes the class so much easier. | He is a great professor, and always willing to provide extra help to anyone who needs it. he gives a lot of examples and makes the material interesting. | Good professor, all notes are online | GREAT professor!! Nicest guy ever, and is always willing to help... the course material is tough but he does a good job at explaining things. | He is probably the worst professor for math 300.Instead of using the textbook he hands out this packet full of ambiguous, pointless examples. Homework's make no sense and he never gave solutions to them so you pretty much have to figure it out on your own. Useless examples in class, useless in office hours, useless as a professor overall | LOVE HIM! such a good teacher, so nice, and extremely helpful. if you ask for help he will bend over backwards to make sure you understand the material and do well. | awesome teacher, teaches stuffs which is not covered in textbook(that textbook is crap).even generates my interest for calc4.Sadly he's not teaching that class and the teacher I had is not as good as him | i LOVE chris woodward!! i had him for intro for math reasoning and hes one of the best professors i ever had!! he is so clear and so concerned that everyone understands the material! :) | He's a bad teacher and doesn't know what he is talking about."
"Gui, Bin","Professor Guo is an amazing professor to take for Probability&Statistics. He is very kind and does his best for his students to pass. He teaches the material as simple as possible. Quizzes every week, but not heavy. His lectures can get heavy from time to time, so participation does matter. Study guides are available before midterms and finals. | Had him for 300 and 350. 350 was a lot harder but massive curve at the end. This man is the goat | Horrible experience. Teaching by not following the book. Confused a lot of people. Not clear what he wants for the exam. Don't take this class with him. | One of my favorite classes so far here at Rutgers. Very kind, understanding, and thorough. I'd recommend him as an instructor as well as the class itself to anyone. | A serious professor that delivers high-quality teaching. Though he does not go above and beyond, this is O.K. as he has no flaws. Easy grading for an easy completion of your degree. Just like a product you can buy on Alibaba or some other Chinese website, he is well worth your precious money. | Best Math Prof I ever meet at Rutgers. Try to make materials as easy as he can. | This is Professor Gui's first time teaching this class and overall he did a great job. He makes the difficult material easy to understand. I wish I can take more math classes with him :) | Really nice professor, care about his students a lot. I cannot wait to take more math classes he teaches. Make concept easy to understand and very patience. | only annoying thing is that his hw is graded for accuracy and is 20% of your grade but the exams are literally the same as the hw/workshops so basically this man is the �� no cap | Easiest calc professor at Rutgers by far. Exams are extremely straight forward. Quizzes depend on TA but should do well if you stay on track with weekly material. Very little webassign HW and will give you an extensions if you ask (I got it 3 times lol). | Ez class, not much homework (webassign). Majority of exam questions are similar to the ones on homework. | Please for the love of god take Calc 3 with him if you can. His lectures are great, he posts them online, he assigned a very fair amount of homework, and the exams will always have stuff you've practiced if you did the homework truthfully. I can't think of a better time in a math class ever. | Take calc 3 with him if you can so that you can make your life easier | Best Math Professor I've ever had and a relatively easy class. So kind, considerate, and understanding | This is so far the easiest class I have taken at Rutgers. Got a 100 on the first midterm, and 100s on all quizzes and Maple labs. Although it seems like he isn't comfortable as a professor yet, he makes everything understandable. Lots of examples, lots of explanations. I advise taking him. Just hope you get a better recitation TA than I did. | Takes a few classes to get used to his style of teaching. Really clear and straightforward, exams are easy he doesn't try to trick you. I suggest if you are struggling with material to also watch Professor Leonard lectures on youtube. That with attendance of lectures and you're set for an A in this class. DON'T LEAVE MAPLE LABS FOR THE DAY BEFORE | easy test and easy to pass the class and get A | He's best calc professor at Rutgers. If you do HW well, you would get a great grade. He's a good man. | he could explain the knowledge very clear | Gui is a great professor. He should be one of the best Cal 3 teachers at Rutgers. If you do HW on your own and practice similar question, it should be an easy A."
"Mejia-Ramos, Juan","the class ended up being one of my favorites this semester. He expected a lot of reading and you had to be in class but he was also really helpful, exams were open book open notes and the biggest part of the grade was the final project, which you had all semester to work on and get feedback on. He's really fair overall. | He is a very knowledgeable professor. He is very helpful and truly wants you to do well. If you're are not fluent in Spanish, you might have a tough time keeping up with his explanation. | Honestly, Juan Pablo is a great professor. The material may be hard to follow if you are not familiar with linguistics. Other than that, he is extremely helpful and fairly lenient when it comes to grading. If you email him, go to his office hours, or ask him questions he will ALWAYS be there to help. | His class is easy if you do the homework and study for the exams. He is a pretty easy grader. He has a really thick Argentinian accent and rushes through all the slides in class. He doesn't really speak any English so if you aren't a native spanish speaker or don't know spanish at the advanced level, you will struggle in his class."
"Komlos, Janos","I would not recommend, he told us we had a short quiz 2 nights before. Cares way too much about teaching. He has a micromanagement problem. exams are not too bad but i would not recommend him. | Had him for 300H and 196. Professor Komlos' honors section of math 300 was probably easier than the regular sections. He spent a lot of time to ensure that students understand a concept well before moving on to other topics. Be prepared to not hear half of what he's saying during class because his voice is very quiet. | It is clear that the professor has a vast knowledge of what he teaches, but he often falls flat in making students interested and fails to project his voice, which made him difficult to hear, even around 10 or 15 feet away. He also is rather strict about electronics, but overall a nice man who cares about students who put in effort. | A very great and easy teacher. Explains things extremely clearly and loves talking to students and helping them with any questions they might have. He told us all he is not just our teacher for this class, but for the rest of our academic career. He crammed multiple assignments in the last weeks, but otherwise almost no hw and easy grader. | Prof Komlos is the best math professor at Rutgers, hands down! He is super caring and a very clear lecturer. Proofs have never been easier! He is also a very patient and kind man--don't be fooled by the gruff Hungarian accent, he's sweet and just really loves to teach (and is good at it!). Also check out his undergraduate math seminar! | Boring professor. Lectures are slow. His age is showing. Easy class but make sure you go to office hours for feedback for your proofs or else you will not improve. Pop quizzes were annoying. Often goes on long tangents about math. Class seems to start when he feels like it and ends the same so expect a 1 hour 40 minute class instead of 1 hour 20min | Professor Komlos has a real gift for explaining things... you will learn alot! The end of the class (300) gets kinda hard but if you go to office hours he will explain things very thoroughly. Definitely reccommend this professor. | He is a very good professor. He is patient, and basically spoonfeeds us everything we need to succeed on the exams. Infact, I thought the class was a bit slow at times. Just show up, take notes on what he says, and then do some practice problems. | He is a very good teacher, and extremely patient. He can be very slow at times, which gets a little boring, but you will definitely learn. His exams have mostly easy problems, with one or two hard ones. Some of them were taken directly from his recommended problem set, so make sure you do all the recommended problems. | Excellent professor. His lecture plan is certainly not your normal ""follow the book"" plan but he insists that he devotes time to certain topics deliberately to highlight some of the subtleties in mathematical logic - and he's absolutely right. His lectures are interesting, illuminating, and exciting. He also really cares about each of his students. | He is an amazing teacher. Great at explaining the material, and really helpful in office hours. But you really have to put work in to understand everything well, since the in class tests are demanding. I really enjoyed the class, but I could have done better if I worked harder from the start, so take him if you want to work hard learn the material. | Excellent professor, crystal clear in lecture and cares very deeply for his students. Go to the extra workshops for hands-on guidance. Very friendly and willing to advise you on mathematics. | This guy is truly amazing! He does go over proofs, the thought process, etc. in the beginning. Take home midterm was awesome! | Best Mathematics professor at Rutgers. Even if he doesn't ""go over the proofs,"" he teaches you the structure in a clear fashion. He knows his stuff and explains everything with such intensity; his lectures are very motivating. I suggest looking for 'themes' in the notes and problems assigned. He's also very kind, so ask him to explain things! | This guy is amazing! He goes over the basic structure of proofs. Goes over the important proofs in class. Crystal clear. Only gripe that I have is that he erases the board too quickly. Other than that, he is one of the best professors I have ever had. | Like the previous person said, after looking at my final grade, I definitely saw kindness in there. I failed my first exam but I worked really hard afterwards and got an A. This class is no joke, he expects you to work hard on your own! Doesn't do example proofs in class at ALL! | He is a pretty hard teacher. He is friendly, even in a class at 9pm, but he is hard, his exams are out to get you, and a number of people dropped the class. I thought I was doing really poorly up until the very end when i was suprised by my final grade, he does have a heart afterall. | Must attend class thought its pointless since he doesn't go over proofs in class. He is willing to help you in office hours but beware he makes you feel like a complete moron. The meanest professor I have ever had. | Professor Komlos is one of the best teachers Ive ever had. Once you gain his respect, he will be a very nurturing teacher. If you want to succeed in the math department, take the honors section of math 300 early on and get on his good side. He will help you go very far. | Tough class. Pretty good prof., but can be too passionate about things, comes off as grumpy sometimes. Good during office, but if you don't get it right away he seems kind of frustrated. | He is quite clear and repeats main points many times, too many times, but class is so boring | A very good teacher. He is very energetic, so he keeps you awake. He is also very good at explaining ideas, and even if you didn't catch it the first time around, he usually repeats important concepts a few times. | Class was difficult, but he's one of the best professors at Rutgers - so smart and, if he thinks you're smart, he's more than willing to help you. Thankful that I got to take his class. And I iterate the cute Hungarian accent comment. Holler. | Great teacher- very funny and very smart. I already know calc 4 by heart but if I didn't, he would be the first person I'd go to with a question. | i would never have graduated if it were not for him. he is the cutest little hungarian guy with the best accent ever. he dances around the room with great enthusiasm and wants everyone to do well. i struggled in calc 4 and this professor helped me learn EVERYTHING that i missed. great guy! | Total arrogant jerk. Grumpy old man, angry if you don't know 300 inside out. Too smart, hates you if you're not a genius & actually have to think about an answer. Helpful office, yes, but hardly has office hrs since he's old as dirt. | Very good prof, good lectures, very helpful if you go to his office hours. | No Comments"
"Moeller, Sven","Homework (5 problems) once a week, not too bad. No surprises on exams. Go over homework/workshops and textbook examples and you should be fine for the exams. 72 is a B. Study his notes. Go to class because he explains things well. Makes the exams fair and not too difficult so would highly recommend him over the other professors."
"Huang, Xiaojun","He is very merciful: his special and lenient grading criteria makes sure everyone pass the course. As for the exam problems, he reuses the old exams in the past few years a lot. The textbook he uses is vivid, which is friendly for a novice in analysis."
"Beck, Jozsef","Professor Beck was easily the worst professor I have had at Rutgers. He came to class unprepared every single time. He would go off on tangents and make up problems off of the top of his head that he could not properly solve in class. He didn't even have a syllabus. When classes were switched to online, he was even worse. Do not take his classes. | Professor Beck is an unbelievably nice and smart man. He obviously lives and breathes mathematics. However, he is not the best lecturer for calc 3. I found myself heavily relying on my TA for help. His exams tend to be very difficult, but he curves heavily to compensate for the low averages. | The average of first quiz(exam) is 20 out of 100. He came across as a respected professor and interesting lecturer. But you will find he could not help but involuntarily showing his contempt to those who ask easy questions. He assumes his students are PhD candidates. | Beck's lecture is somewhat interesting. But he doesn't make hard stuff easy. He skips a whole lot of steps when sloving problems, and in office hours he only repeats what he said in class. So there is no way for students who do not understand the materials to figure out . Overall having this class is not a good learning experience. | Beck was on his way to becoming one of my fav teachers as his lectures were interesting and his personally appeared friendly. HOWEVER he literally told us that his exams were made up the night before and had nothing to do with the lectures INTENTIONALLY. It was open notes but nothing applied. The final average for the class was a 15/100 but curved | *GO TO CLASS* That's how you achieve an A. I took him in spring 2016. Professor Beck bases everything on class notes and he doesn't use sakai nor textbook. Multi Calc is a hard subject itself but he simplifies it in simple language. I study 1-2 nights before exams and I aced both. Final is cumulative but relatively easy. Don't SKIP or get an F :-) | So, I read comments here. Some of them said ""Go to lecture"". I did as they told. Surprisingly, even it was 8.40 am in the morning, I was really happy to be in the class. He made everything super clear and easy even for the exams. I also went to his office hours whenever I had a question. He was really easy to talk to. Thus, don't miss a lecture! | Really strange way of thinking, loves to invent new words. Thankfully, he will often allow students to explain concepts to other students. Loves to criticize your ideas. If you just want to pass the quizzes, do all the textbook problems, but attending his lectures are worth it just for the Erdos stories. Generous curve from massive class confusion. | Just pay attention in class, take good notes, and study your midterms for the final. He gave a 25pt bonus question on midterm 2... he wants you to get an A. He doesn't teach maple labs, so if you have to take calc 4 (which requires maple labs), you'll be kind of screwed. With a little work its an easy A. | NICE CURVE. He rarely follows the book, but he will not put anything on the exam that he did not go over in class. | Absolutely useless prof. who makes zero effort to teach and then gives ridiculous exams. Sure, its open book and note, but he literally puts problems on tests that are more difficult than any textbook example. Doesn't give a syllabus or homework either. I would avoid this guy if you care about your learning or your grade. | He didn't teach any of the material, and now I'm underprepared for higher level courses. He literally ignored the book and the curriculum in favor of teaching whatever he wanted. It's a shame Rutgers has professors this bad, and they should at least stick them on unimportant classes. You'll get an A but won't learn a single thing in the process. | You will not learn anything in the class, but he is honestly one of the nicest professors. He does not want to see anyone fail and curves really nicely. No required homework and exams are very difficult, but everything was covered during class. | Professor Beck is HILARIOUS. He is very funny and one of the coolest professors I ever had. You dont need the book nor to really go to class.. BUT GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS they are extremely helpful. He is understanding and tells you what will be on the exam. Take him! | He is one of those teachers that knows a lot of math but does not know how to teach it. I recommend using the free online classes offered by MiT to learn the material; Dennis Aroux does a MUUUUCH better job at explaining the content. | He's a really nice guy and wants you to do well but he's unclear while teaching and doesn't use the textbook much at all. | He's hilarious and is smart. He will make fun of you. Going to office hours is helpful and enjoyable. All in all he is a down to earth person ready to teach maths to you. If you don't understand, ask. | this guy is the man. highly recommended. he's funny, helpful, and wants you to do well in the class. | Good teacher and funny. He didn't cover many sections that were required by the math department though. His tests were really hard but the curve is ridiculously crazy in a good way for us | very smart and clear. has the wit of a sarcastic comedian too. 1 unhelpful thing though is how much he mentions the dichotomy between students who are good at math and those who aren't--it'd be better for him just to assign more work so we all can get better. best to have him if you're very motivated to study alone and go to his (many) office hours | Took the 477 with him. He is a good humorous guy. Class was easy as well. However, did not learn anything in the class. Does not prepare me for Math 424 and other classes. Resulting retake the class. | Horrible. Gave us an actual syllabus 1 week prior to the second exam. Also, I took this class hoping to prepare for the actuarial exam. This guy taught me almost nothing. He spends the entire first half on combinatorics (when it should really be 1 or 2 weeks) and the second half on expectation on variance. Only covered 2 of the many distributions. | No structure, syllabus, game-plan whatsoever. His quizes/exams may be open-book, but you hardly learn anything from the class. You learn nearly 0% of what's required of a probability student and learn how to do problems via his own convoluted methods which end up confusing you even more. Don't expect to learn anything. Read the book yourself. | As is often the case with men of high intellect, the ability to translate the topics they so clearly understand fail when teaching others. Beck is no exception. While he may be a man of genius, he fails to adequately teach the subject. And, rather than relying on a text, he cavalierly dismisses its methods in lieu of his warbled thoughts. | He is just all over the place. No syllabus, no structure. He didn't even tell us when are exams were going to be until the week before. He was so confusing and not very organized on the board. The good thing is that his exam are open book and exactly like the quizzes. | Loved his class, he's accent and sense of humor actually make the topic quite enjoyable. He is incredibly smart and the exams are fairly easy especially if you attend class. He sometimes does the exact problem the day before the exam... | I agree with the post below entirely. He also tends to talk about one thing then jumps to something entirely different but he is very likable just study everyday and you may be alright! | class average for his exams were ridiculously low (45/100 was A). Doesn't really likes to give partial credits. He is pretty interesting to listen to unlike the rest of the math department, but his lectures will only prepare you for his midterms, not for the final. I'm sure that you're going to like him, but not your exam grades. | He is simply the best Math professor ever. The guy is hilarious and teaches the important aspects of the subject well. He does gloss over the trivial concepts but still manages to make the class epic. Easy grader too: 80+ = A! Highly recommend! | Very confusing and strays off topic often, I would try to avoid him if you can. He does not require a specific textbook nor gives out any sort of homework. The grade is entirely dependent upon quizzes and the midterm/final. | Prof. Beck is absolutely amazing. He's hilarious and >80 is an A, >60 is a B. All of the tests are open book. The class is a bit boring at times, and he goes on really random tangents with his problems, but attendance isn't mandatory. | Very entertaining, taught a difficult class, but has an amusing style and cracks alot of math jokes, very fair grader, don't be fooled by the easy day to day, his tests are tough. | Beck is the man. Hands down. Who cares if he isn't the best teacher? That's what the book is for. You will anticipate his class bc it will be the highlight of your day. He is also a genius; go to one of his lectures and see for yourself. | This teacher is brilliant | he was a rotten instructor. he teaches barely anything; not helpful. grades OK but he presents an oversimplified and confusing view of an intricate subject. | I strongly disliked this guy. YEAH an 80 is an A and YEAH a 60 is a B but he doesn't teach anything. He'll spend the whole period on one problem. I asked him after class one day what I could do to learn the material better and he told me either youre smart or youre not. Very unhelpful and doesn't give too much partial credit. Avoid if u want 2 lear | good teacher, very eccentric | The best teacher I have ever had. He takes mathematics as it is. He has some kind of humor, too that some people like, others not. Find out for yourself. | I'm a math major, but I wouldn't want to be in Beck's class if I wasn't. Nonetheless, he is interested in teaching and is a real character. I liked him thoroughly. | No Comments | He's a bad teacher if you're truly interested in learning the material. He does only give A's and B's but it's hard to get an A. He is very condescending sometimes and just doesn't relate well to students. He is also very stingy with partial credit. We didn't learn much at all all semester. Avoid pl | He's a very nice and animated guy. I dont like how he doesnt go over the theory, he immediately jumps to problems, and the problems are hard. Tests are ok with a decent curve. I've had better math professors and worse, so if you want to take this class, he's not a bad choice. | what a mess | Nice guy, will try to help you whenever he can. His tests were a toss up each time, ranging from a joke to extremely hard, but with a curve. He only wants to give As and Bs unless you totally screw up. | eh | One of the best teachers in Rutgers. Out of five that I had so far into my senior year... Grading excellent.... teaches you in high school language with college skills. | He tries his best, he really wants to help us. It's just that he has no idea how to dumb it down for us so that us non-math majors can actually understand the stuff."
"Kiessling, Michael","I took Dr Kiessling for Calculus 1 at Rutgers. The class was the first math class I had to really work my butt off for, but it was worth it. I finished with an A and I now, years later teach Calculus myself and am grateful for the experience I had with Dr Kiessling. Many reviews here are complaints of difference between high school and college. | VERY bad professor. I ask him questions, and he just replies by saying, ""I guess you weren't listening properly."" Doesn't give out proper material to prepare for exams. I asked him, with a group of friends, to provide us with answers to practice questions, and he just made up excuses like, ""the answers are in the text."" NOT true. AVOID safe. | AVOID IF YOU CAN!!! Terrible, terrible teacher. Unclear and not neat at all. Quiz every class. Material was difficult enough but he made it even more difficult. Always goes off on a tangent. | The dude is incredibly confusing. He gives out quizzes all the time, so go to class but you're really going to have to do the homework and teach yourself in order to pass this class | Exams and quizzes made up the grade and they were entirely based on proofs. He is reeeally hard to follow and his proofs arent in the textbook so take good notes. No numerical answers on exams AT ALL, all proofs, so honestly he made the class pretty useless as far as real world applications. You really gotta put in work to get an A | Ok, he's not the best professor at all. He explains mostly abstract things in lecture and you pretty much only go just in case there's a quiz. That being said, the quizzes are exact questions from homework, tests are just like the homework and recitation should clear most things up. Just actually try. If you get him, you don't NEED him to pass. | Had him for Calc II. Holy crap. worst professor EVER. don't even bother going to lecture. it's just a waste of 80min. go to recitation, if you have a good TA and you teach yourself the material pretty well, then you might be fine. otherwise, seriously avoid this prof at ANY cost. oh yea.he uses the weirdest symbols so everything is very confusing. | WORSTTTT MATH PROF! He is smart just doesn't know how to teach. Failed his course. So just quit whilel your at it. | Spends all of the class time on Proofs, which is not always bad. However, at times the entire class can't follow the proofs! Exams can be very touch. And the Final was impossible. Overall, not really such a bad teacher. Class averages were in the 40s! | He is seriosly the wort prof I've ever had. I am just trying to help you. DO NOT take him. I have never struggled with math, but with this guy math sucks. I wasted my time and I'm gonna end up dropping. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. | By far the worst prof in the department! Everything you do in class is, according to the book, ""beyond the scope of the course""...yet he insists upon doing it even though no one understands any of it...first exam average=40%...what a joke. | Worst guy ever for differential equations! Cant explain and uses every single greek letter ever! does not use numbers in his examples and wants students to PROOF theorems during the exams!do not take him! | worst prof ever. goes on tangent never uses book. the exam problems are one you've never seen before, all abstract and does not help. CAN NOT TEACH | I got the feeling he sort of wanted us to do well; he just didn't realize he was misleading everyone (this makes his excitement while doing so absolutely hilarious). Regardless, he was utterly incomprehensible. I took Calc in high school and got an A. Here, I got a C+. On the bright side, he reminded me of a little German lawn gnome. | WORST EVER. will embarrass you in front of the class. only uses greek letters and talks nonstop about physics | at first he was really difficult to understand, he mised a few lectures; i flunked his first midterm as did majority of the class. Helpful during office hours, and actually became not only someone i admire, but even more than that. he doesn't curve individual tests. in the end i did well though, and would actually pick up another one of his classes | HORRIBLE TEACHER. DO NOT TAKE HIM. sure he may be a brilliant mathematician, but he can't teach for beans. he insists on using complicated variables and symbols we've never seen before and when asked to explain it in terms we can understand, he refuses. in addition to response below, highest grade on exam 1 was a 69. HORRIBLE, I SAY! | one word....RUN!!!! hes the second worst teacher i had in rutgers....first one being my expos teacher lol. but yea...this guy is insane. he likes to show off his knowledge to us when we are only taking calc 1. I couldnt believe the highest 2nd hourly exam grade was a 65. a 65!!!! wtf!?! avoid him. Take my word for it | This guy SUCKS on ICE!!! Don't take him ever!!! He is the master of creating confusions... BEWARE!!! | He subbed for my class one day and was HORRIBLE. His goal was to discuss partial fractions and never talked about it but just rambled on about imaginary numbers, etc, etc. His is English is no bad, but a classic example ""Just because you have a Phd from Harvard doesn't mean you can teach."" | This guy is the cutest prof I've ever had. | bad teacher. | TERRIBLE professor. he's probably a genius but can't teach for his life. makes everything so much harder than it needs to be. you can't get help from him coz he just confuses you more. calc is not hard, but it seems impossible in HIS class | He was always very kind to me as an undergraduate and actually became my mentor. I was always welcome to drop by any time. I fell asleep in all my classes in all subjects, so my memory of the clarity of his lectures is unclear . . . | An utterly horrible communicator. He thinks his class is following his lesson, but he is really just luring them deeper and deeper into the realm of ""lost."" | He tries to help and he knows his stuff but he just doesn't know how to teach it. Seen the guy use every letter from a to k and symbol from tildas to hats on one problem..the guy doesn't know how to do examples...kills ur GPA completely. Stay Away. | Lectures hard to understand- he's hard to understand. Speaks on and on when the whole class is clueless. Makes fun of you for asking questions, limited office hour (On a Friday). Great class for ruining your GPA :("
"Kepley, Shane","He was awful. First, he does ask for specific book definitions from the book on quizzes. He never directly answered students questions, he would answer back with a question. He doesnt give any useful feedback on quizzes. Youre lucky if he goes through one or more practice problems in recitation. DO NOT take him for Calc recitation. | Had him for recitation for Calc 135, found him to be terrible (as did my class). Quizzes always have you write out (yes, using words) definitions of things/concepts. Actual problems are more difficult than other TAs' quizzes. Makes simple concepts seem complex. Honestly think he's too smart for 135, should be teaching like engineering Calc 5."
"Luo, Feng","His exams were very similar to homework problems, and he was really nice. He's a really chill guy and as long as you go to lecture and do the homework, you're pretty much good. Definitely an underrated professor! | If you're not majoring in maths, Luo is the best professor you can take for 250. Proofs are not a part of Luo's exams, unlike with most other 250 professors (from what I've heard). Final grades are done on a curve, with approximately 20% of the class receiving an A. Exams are graded quickly. Luo's lectures are fast-paced, so you never space out. | He goes fast in his lectures but explains the topics really well. He gives textbook homework and bases his quizzes/exams off of them. He also gives a very clear outline of each exam(i.e exactly what topic each question covers) and tells you what homework questions to focus on. The exams are fairly easy if you study what he tells you to. | Feng Luo is a good lecture even though he does go a bit fast and his lectures feel like they are coming straight out of the book. He is very knowledgeable and explains questions well. The only downside of the class is how much homework is given. I spend about 2-3 hours on homework for this class per week. Other then that, he is a solid lecture. | His lectures generally just follow the format of the textbook and are pretty dry. Nice previews into test questions if you attend lecture and office hrs though! | This professor assigns more than four times as much homework as other math professors at Rutgers. He also does not tell students ahead of time which problems will be graded, so they must do about twenty-five problems per week, which takes about 7 to 8 hours per week outside of class. He clearly does not value his students' time. Don't take him | He writes a LOT during lectures, so showing up and taking good notes is a must. He does examples in class and tells you that something VERY similar will be on an exam, making the exam much less of a surprise and studying less stressful. His exams are very fair and are graded fairly. He moves very fast, but will slow down if you ask. | You'll spend sometimes more than 4 hours on a homework assignment since he doesn't follow the book. Exam questions are out of nowhere. Spends more time on useless proofs rather than material you actually need to know for exams. Seriously avoid. He teaches and talks really fast. | I'm taking calc 151 (honors section) with him. His tests, homework, and workshop problems can be challenging, but as long as you pay attention and work hard, it should be an easy ride. He does talk fast in his lectures, but if you really focus, you can get used to it. Sit in front if you can. Very willing to help outside of class. | Great professor. Clear lectures, a bit fast, but not a problem. FAIR exams. Helpful with questions. I recommend him. | He was really great and helpful | Crystal clear, very organized, friendly and answers questions well. This man carried a difficult topology class even though the textbook was sorely lacking. Can be a bit fast in lecture, but exams reward those that keep up and ask questions. | Really great professor! His notes were super organized, and he taught so well in class that I never had to read the textbook. He made the subject easy. SUPER NICE. | great professor, class notes were so helpful, quizzes every week, homework required to be turned in, his exams were harder than hw, but everything was doable, but there can be a lot of hw problems | Start right at the start of the class and won't stop until the last second. He's really fast so you would have to be fast too or you'll lose track and won't learn anything the rest of the class. | Really good teacher, really knows his stuff. I agree with before, his knowledge is his curse. Some of his quiz questions are insanely hard. Definitely doesn't provide enough time to properly finish an exam or quiz. A lot of material, and he'll push through nonstop to the end of the period teaching. A bit of an accent, easy to get used to. | VERY FAST. Tests are not reflective of homework problems-some of the questions I never even seen before and require critical thinking. NOT HELPFUL in office hours. He is a very brilliant man and that can be his curse. He does not realize that NON-math and NON-physics majors are taking this course and do not ""know"" as much math as deeply as he do | Lectures are clear and elegant, do require stamina (He goes full tilt right for the entire period.) One of the few classes I've taken where my notes are actually useful for studying. Best math teacher I've seen in college. | One of the best professors I had at Rutgers. His accent takes some time to get used to, but his teaching is supurb. Unlike other sections, we never had to do any proofs. The HW and the exams were all very straightforward problems. Moreover, he taught everything we needed, and I am glad I didn't have to read that confusing book. | He explains well but will do speed lecture for the whole class period. His test are somewhat different that his homework but doable. I learned a lot from his class. I recommend him for Linear Algebra."
"Xiao, Jingni","The 3.0 review is also me, but I kind of realized after the class that she is a really good professor, but there is no doubt the quizzes and tests are not what you expect. Doing the True & False questions really do help and even though it's all open-ended questions, the curve gives you that bump up. Definitely ask for help, as she is welcoming it. | Although she is a very nice person, I cannot say the same about being a teacher. The quizzes are wildly more different than what you would expect and almost every single problem is open-ended. She is very helpful in getting help and the teaching is okay, it's just the tests and quizzes that are the real problem. You really need to study & practice. | Best professor in math classes. Lectures are clear and helpful. Homework is a little bit more, like 3hrs to do one hw due weekly. If u can fully understand the hw problem and example in classes, you will be fine and earn at least bplus"
"Thomas, Simon","Really good and a true expert. He's probably too good to teach undergraduates and it shows. Sometimes, he glosses over things, but makes up for this by patiently answering any questions. Exams are close to practice problems, but be prepared to study a lot especially if this is your intro to abstract math. | My favorite professor I've taken in the math department so far. His enthusiasm for the subject is infectious and he breaks tricky proofs down into steps that are easy to follow. Tricky homework and exams, but generous curve at the end. | is bored, has nothing to do and thinks his students are like him so he just piles impossible questions in hw/exam. the arbitrary grading criteria doesnt help, takes off points in any way he can (writing equinumerous vs isomorphic can make you lose a point), also lied about grade cutoffs when i asked him, i shouldve withdrawn... vile human | 10 hw. 3 exams. Funny, helpful, interesting. Mix of computation and proofs. Answers questions well and promptly. Simplifies and explains material well. Exams are similar to practice exams so just do those and you'll be fine. Shows how linear algebra can be used in real world and makes the proofs easy. Best math professor I've had at RU. Take him! | This guy is the best professor I've ever had. His lectures are crystal-clear, and he's obviously passionate about his subject. He gives really great responses to questions, too; not to mention, he has a great sense of humor. Tests are pretty easy if you do the practice problems beforehand. Would recommend him to any math major. | Went to office hours very frequently and thanks to Thomas was able to grasp course material I'd previously thought beyond me. Also there's something about non-rhoticism that befits higher education. | Simon Thomas is the greatest professor...ever. No discussion. Extremely clear, very approachable. Great person. | best teacher ever need i say more? | The best professor at RU hands down. 2 exams, 11 homeworks and final, all VERY easy. Exams were very similar to the homeworks. Very easy to get an A in the class. Be careful though, he does deduct trivial points if the mathematical english is incorrect which can be costly at the end. So be mathematically correct when you write proofs. | great teacher...the end of the semester get very hard but he keeps it clean cut | The best professor of math I have had. I will stalk him down and take all the classes he teaches! He has the cutest english accent, and is as funny as intelligent! Come to class early and listen to some funny stories too! | Made the class very fun. Has the best english accent. Very clear about what is needed. Exams are very fair. Grading too. Has a nice sense of humor. Will definitely take classes with him again! | spends a class pre-exam going over questions that are extremely similar to the ones on the actual exam. if you go to class, there's no reason why you should not do well. but also smart enough to engage in some higher level math. | Great professor. Always very well prepared for class. Answers even the stupidest questions with patience. | great teacher; makes jokes; very approachable; highgly recommended | Great Professor! Very Clear, Very Enthusiastic. Sarcastic wit and subtle insults towards dummies keep the class entertaining."
"Huang, Yi-Zhi","He is very merciful: his special and lenient grading criteria makes sure everyone pass the course. As for the exam problems, he reuses the old exams in the past few years a lot. The textbook he uses is vivid, which is friendly for a novice in analysis."
"Klatt, Brian","A lot of the time he had no idea what was on the exams or what we should really be focusing on. The course coordinator was stressing this conceptual learning approach and Professor Klatt didnt seem to know what that meant. If you even want a 2 hour extension or any mercy on homework, dont expect it from him. | Professor Klatt is a gem! He answers q's and truly wants you to learn. My advice: Go to lecture! It is not mandatory, but his lectures will help you learn the basics you need for hw and in general. You can't expect to do well without basics. Use Dr. G's worksheets to study. Go 2 office hours and ask q's (if you can't you probably don't understand). | Professor Klatt is an absolute LEGEND. Make no mistake, if you don't put the work in, you're not going to be successful, but Professor Klatt does everything he can to help students out. He goes through material at a pace that makes sure everyone understands what is going on, and he answers any questions sent in chat. Overall, 10/10. | Professor Klatt is probably the best professor for Calc 135. He is amazing with his lectures, and he really makes it easy to understand the concepts in math instead of memorizing. He also has a great sense of humor and is laid back. I highly suggest taking his class because I guarantee you will learn a lot and be successful!!! | Prof. Klatt is very nice and helpful, especially going to office hours and asking specific questions before an exam. He is funny too. | Professor Klatt made Calc fun for me again. I used to hate math in high school because I did not understand the material, but still got by. He goes at a semi slow pace which helps me understand everything and will try his best to answer all the question, no matter how ""dumb"" it may be. Overall an amazing professor and definitely deserves a raise. | Klatt had some faults in his teaching, but overall, the concepts we learned were very easy to grasp while in his lectures. His teaching was great, and the exams reflected the class's understanding of the material. Overall, a good class and a good professor for anyone who is looking for a good professor. | Tests do not reflect the material that is covered in class - be warned. Lecture is very theory heavy while the exams are mostly computational. He's okay. | Professor Klatt has good lectures, and as long as you go to class and stay engaged in the content you'll do well. He goes over a lot of examples, and is good at answering questions if you have any. Exams are easy if you study the homework, take good notes, and do practice problems. There are also simple pop quizzes and weekly homework assignments. | Pretty good lecturer (though he spends too much time on some examples that aren't very relevant). Attendance was practically mandatory due to pop quizzes (which were very easy). This class is test heavy with 80% of your grade determined by 2 midterms and final. If you can do all the assigned homework this class is very doable. | Professor Klatt makes this class SO easy. Linear Algebra is the easiest math class I have ever taken, and I think it is mainly because Professor Klatt explains everything so well (lots of examples). Honestly, if you show up to the first three or four lectures, and then don't show up again, you will pass. Everything uses the same math, and is easy."
"Miller, Stephen","Will be tough if you are not good at math. Goes very fast, skips steps, doesn't explain much, expects you to understand it immediately and lots of homework. Not impossible to pass though, curves every test by 20 points. | This professor has no interest in helping his students learn the material. Any questions result in condescending answers or excuses such as he doesn't have time and isn't paid enough to be helpful. Spends half the class looking blankly at the book and the other half erasing mistakes he made on the board. Impossible exams are worth 80% of the grade. | Possibly the worst teacher I have ever had. Not sure how I banged out a C. Professor is unclear, unhelpful and very confusing. You will end up having to teach yourself. Avoid at ALL costs. | Worse teacher I've had this year. He is very confusing and speaks to students in a condescending tone. | Really good professor if you want to learn. | lot of hard homework, but it's the best way to learn. very willing to help during and outside of class, especially online. | Ok, so this guy is not very helpful, got kicked out of MIS because his students at the time signed a petition to fire him and STATS is all hes got left. He has an awful attitude toward his students, and takes FOREVER to grade anything. the class is not difficult if you take his notes, but he is just one lazy creature. | TAKE NOTES. Herschkorn barely goes by the book, if at all. Pay attention the way he does things because that's how you'll have to do it on exams (which aren't TOO bad) and on homework (due weekly). Overall, he is difficult, but very friendly. I would recommend taking him as long as you plan on keeping up. Grades very fairly. | he writes down everything on the board so go to class and take notes and you should be fine. his homework assignments can be long but they are only once a week. overall i would recommend you take him for stats | If your going to take Stats Methods for business 385 I would take it with him. Good professor. Lots of Notes in the class but tests are open notes and they are pretty self explanatory. Class is not mandatory but I highly recommend going. Good prof | I have had Professor Herschkorn for both Calc and for Stats for Business. As a Calc Professor, he was probably the worst professor I've ever had...anywhere. However, he's actually not a bad Stats teacher...at all. As long as you go to class, take notes and do the homework you should get an A. | Attendance is not mandatory. Lectures are extremely boring and he has a terrible attitude toward his students. Review sheets are good prep for exams. Curves are pretty huge, gave out tons of A's and B's. Must do homework. | Professor Herschkorn did a great job at teaching the course. Most of the tests are straightforward and his review sessions were really helpful. I did have to do a lot of at home studying, but that was only due to the large amount of material covered in the course. Overall, the class has been good. I'd say take Professor Herschkorn for statistics. | one of the worst professors you will ever come across. his teaching methods will leave you dazed and confused. if you are unlucky enough to fall in this guys section do yourself a favor and find another one. he gives out C's like theyre candy. | No one would have attended if hw and quizes weren't scheduled each class. He was useless and taught to the board. It says something when the school has a professor teaching recitation. However bad a teacher he was, he did try, albiet in a pathetic and unproductive way. | I had him for Statistics ten years ago in 1999 and from the comments I have read here he has not changed. I came down with Pneumonia in the Fall of 1999 and on doctor's orders was out of class for 2 weeks. I got notes from classmates and sought help from him, however he refused and turned me away knowing I had been ill. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! | The material is somewhat interesting, and he teaches it differently from the textbook. You learn a lot in the class, but it definitely is hard. Averages are extremely low, but he does give like 25% of the class an A, and 25% of the class a B and B+. If you like probability, take the class, if not, dont. | Really really hard course! Too much mathematical stuff! really hard to get an A. A nightmare to have taken his class! several people dropped immediately and several more dropped after first exam, which turned out to be wise. // for sure you can learn a lot if you can spend a lot of time to follow him well, which is not easy! DO not dream good grade | GPA killer don't take. He doesn't actually teach because he says most people have already taken calc which is true but he makes his exams so hard that it doesn't matter. Keep yourself above the average and you'll be fine. | The class was tough and the exams were almost next to impossible but even with that this professor was very fair. He welcomed questioned and even with the exams being tough, the curve was huge. If you can stay above the class average (which was pretty low) you can pull a B. | One of the worst profs I have come across in my Masters. No matter what level you are studying at BS,MS, he will always teach at a level above it. Teaches stats and claims that he is a probability guy and should be excused if he doesnt use diagrams or pictures to visualize concepts. | if you get him drop and take with someone else. if you stick with him be prepared to work really hard teaching yourself for a C+. i hope he reads this and sees what an awful prof he is | Stephen Herschkorn is honestly one of the worst professors that I have ever had. He teaches in a style that is so ineffective that it's hard to believe that any school would ever allow him to teach. His class ""Basic Stats for Research"" was incredibly complicated for no reason and he was unable to teach the material. Worst professor at Rutgers | Agreed w/ user below.Not basic at all.Class is supposed to be basic level but teaches it at higher level intensive math/logic way bc he is a math professor.Book did not explain the procedures just logic.Need it for HW.If ur an engineer then stay.No?Go away it will drive u nuts sitting through lectures.Horrible,unpleasant,dreadful professor.No life. | ""Basic Probability and Statistics."" I put quotes because it wasn't ""basic"" and there was no statistics. All Probability using calculus and logic. Exams are hard. With that said, the curve is good (50% of the class got a B or higher. 25% got an A) | doesnt get much worse than this. if you are stuck with him have fun teaching yourself calculus and failing his impossible exams :) | i never write on this site but will for this guy specifically to warn people. two words: STAY AWAY. avoid him at all costs!!!!!!!! | hard, useless, incomprehensible. this guy ****s gpas for fun. avoid at all costs. | he is horrible at teaching the material. i learned more in recitation from someone who barely knew english than i did from this guy. his exams were impossible and his ""curve"" doesnt help. did well on the final because it wasnt written by him. put more time into this class teaching myself than any other and it still wound up being my lowest grade :( | WARNING: DO NOT TAKE CALC WITH HIM IF YOU DID NOT TAKE IT BEFORE. He assumes everyone has taken calculus before so he doesn't elaborate on topics. Gives simple examples and hard exams. Curve is almost nonexistent. 85 is an A. 72 is B. He is prompt in answering questions and emails though. Quizzes and hw count for nothing. | He obviously knows calculus because he would go on forever proving theorems and equations, but he CANNOT teach. I only passed because I had calc in highschool. Everyone learned more in recitation than in lecture. The curves were aweful because everyone did horribly. PLEASE find another professor if you want to do well. | Poor guy was a mess, always looked disheveled. Exams are completely based on the previous years exam and if you memorize the solutions he gives you for those you can definitely get an alright grade. Final sucked but he didn't write it. Averages were low but he did use a curve. Recitation was key. | 3 tests. to get an A u need 3 As on all tests. I got an A on my final and A and B on 2 midterms. i got a B+. 35% F 3 %A. nice guy, smart. | destroyed my gpa. almost %60 got D/F. 5 out of 60something got A's. stay away. | stay away. he is very very bad teacher. hard exams and does not know how to teach. | This guy is the worst math teacher ever to come to Rutgers. His tests were IMPOSSIBLE with class averages in the 40's and 50's. Almost half of the class failed. It is amazing that this guy has not been fired. Only way to pass is by doing well on the final because he doesn't write it. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS! | I would not recommend this professor to anyone taking Calc for the first time. I consider myself really good at math, but this was incredibly difficult. The other raters are certainly not exaggerating with their comments. | he is a HORRIBLE teacher. don't even bother going to class. if you get him plan on teaching yourself calculus because he is no help. his hourly exams are nearly impossile | I have taken him for Calculus and this guy is the worst teacher ever. Half the class doesn't show up because he can't teach and his exams are nearly impossible. The averages were around a 50 or something. Switch out if you get this guy! | I have taken Calculus in High school and aced the thing. Going to his lecture is such a waste of time. Most of the class is spent doing proofs and example problems that he explains too much in detail that it is extremely baffling to people who never had calculus. Just do the hw problems out of the book and the webwork. his way of teaching is assbac | Actually, I take back my previous comment. It is important to go... nonetheless, it's probably good to study extra after each class. That's a lot of work, though. | So... this is what I suggest: Don't go to lecture. He goes fast and all you can do is take notes (as opposed to intake the notes). It's better to read/practice from the textbook in your room as lecture goes on. Prepare a little extra right before rec. quizzes and do all webwork. After that's done, study hard for the exam, and THEN it's manageable. | Worst Professor Ever at Rutgers!!! Horrible Exams If you dnt have prior calc knowledge you'll def fail it!!! Even His TA Paul dont seems to help out... Worst worst worst Worst Professor!!! | nice guy, horrible professor. he will take the simplest concept and complicate it beyond belief. exams were impossible. with that said he does grade on a big curve because everyone fails and does give a lot of partial credit. help from him was worthless hes just as confusing as he is in his lectures. | nice guy but teaches the simplest concepts in the most complicated way possible. extremely hard exams. he offers extra help but it is worthless. | He makes his exams very hard. Also there is something about his teaching style that makes him very hard to understand. Maybe it's the constant mistakes, maybe it's the worthless proofs which he writes so fast nobody has time to understand. I don't know but what I do know is that he is not a good professor at all and I would not recommend this one. | No Comments | This guy sucks at teaching and can go off on serious tangents leaving everyone in the class wondering what he just said. Also he gives really hard exams that all the studying in the world won't prepare you for. | He is a bad professor. Lectures were worthless, didn't know what he was talking about half the time because he goes so off topic. I am a good math student and got an A in pre-calc. His exams were impossible. I repeat this guys exams are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Not recommended to anyone. STAY AWAY!!!!!!! | i am surprised by the comments he got...i think he is extremely helpful and he is really good at explaining difficult concept! I learned alot from his lectures and he is very helpful too during office hour! His exam is very reasonable and fair! I highly recommend this professor for this class! | By far the worst teacher I have ever had. Attending lecture is not worth it because he uses examples and definitions straight from the book except the book is more comprehensible. Randomly tests on ""vocab"" terms. Midterms were easy if you knew what you were doing; i.e. you have taken calc 2 before. The final was absolutely ridiculous. | Horrible, Horrible teacher! I never took calculus in high school and taking it with this guy made it the worst experience in college. Now I have to retake it because I bombed the exams (just like everyone else) and even the curves don't help. | Please I'm warning anyone who will take Calc 135, make sure that you do not get this professor. He was unapproachable, mean, and assumed that everyone in his class had taken calc before. If you are a freshmen and are taking calc for the first time please make sure not to get this professor or else you will be lost with no help from him. | Makes mistakes in examples in class. Goes off subject to talk about Latin based words. Huge Curves because the only people who can pass his exams have already taken calc 2. The worst possible professor you can get for calc especially if its ur first time taking calc 2. Take at your own risk if he is still teaching. Entire class gave him bad eval. | If you plan on taking another math avoid this man at all costs. He can't teach, and his exams are not at all like the assigned homework. Grades on a huge curve because everyone bombs every test. He didn't like the textbook even though it's the special edition made for Rutgers. Stay away. | Do not take any class with him ever. I have taken calc before and found it pretty easy, but he made it more difficult than it needs to be. His lectures were useless and the tests were impossible. Do not take this class with him, he was a very bad professor. | He does not prepare lectures, meaning he will pull examples out of his head. Don't even bother taking notes... he makes so many mistakes that it'll give you a headache. Do yourself a favor and sit in on another professor's section because attendance is optional for the most part."
"Noh, Eunjung","I had Professor Noh for Linear Op and enjoyed the class! I think it's one of the easier math electives, as her class didn't have many proofs and was algebra-heavy. The problems are extremely long and some may consider them boring (?) but I enjoyed how methodical the class was. I definitely recommend! | Standard math course, but let me warn you it is VERY boring. You learn basically directly from the textbook and do basic algebra in 50 different ways. Mostly computation and not theoretical. HW takes a while. Exams are fair. | Very nice professor!! Her hand writing is super good and explain the material very clearly. Must take her courses | A nice lady but the lecture is super boring which makes an unmotivated person doesn't have any mood to study the tedious subject. | Honestly, I genuinely think she's the greatest prof in the math department. Kids seem to complain about lectures being boring, but, this is college, lectures aren't for entertainment. Other than that, she's so nice about questions being asked, and is so willing to help if you're struggling. The exams are very fair and the grading curve is generous | She's pretty quiet and hard to hear even if you sit in the front row. Sometimes it wasn't clear from the lecture how she wanted us to solve certain problems, forcing me to self-study. For exams, she would put anything remotely related to the subject at hand and throw us off, so study everything. She provides solutions to HW and exams at the least. | I took this class because she was the highest rated Calc 5 professor. However, within the first month, lectures were unhelpful since she essentially wrote the textbook on the board while speaking so softly and monotonously. Lecture is useless. Her exams are hard but the averages are pretty high. You have to teach yourself in order to pass. | She's monotone and boring. She literally writes the textbook on the board as her notes. So if you don't understand the textbook, you won't understand her. you're better off having a hard professor but a great lecturer. | Very boring. Teaches exactly by the book. All you do is tedious computations. | Very clear lecturer. Fair exams and HW, reasonable grading scale. | She's very organized with her material. Her lecture notes are very clear and shows the steps, but she won't post her notes online. Exams are fair, basically from the HWs and exam reviews. Gives a lot of room for the HW due date. | She's a new hire here at Rutgers and just got her PhD, she goes over a ton of material in a very short period which can seem tough... Very welcoming to questions/helpful"
"Queirolo, Elena",Easily the best TA in the Math department. Much better than the professor she was the TA for. | She is the sweetest TA ever! I love her! She explains everything so well:)
"Matveev, Konstantin","HW:25% (8 total), Higher midterm grade:20%, Lower midterm grade:15% (2 total), Quiz:10% (3 total, lowest dropped), Final:30%. If you want to pass lectures are very helpful and needed to keep up. He makes quizzes and tests very fair according to the HWs. Also gives HW solutions and quiz solutions as study material. Class material is difficult. | Very caring professor but his lectures consist of large paragraphs with barely any examples. Hard to follow but definitely helpful if you attend office hours. Went into the final barely passing but a generous curve helped me get a B. | Prof. Matveev is a nice person, but he's a difficult professor who at times isn't clear when he teaches. He usually teaches by writing lengthy paragraphs, and it's often times very difficult to follow his lectures. However, he is helpful, and if you go to office hours, he can clarify your doubts. | Professor Matveev is a genius and is amazing at teaching. His homeworks are tough but very rewarding and interesting. Also, Professor Matveev is available in many office hours each week and is very helpful in them. I highly recommend taking Professor Matveev."
"Sahi, Siddhartha","Lectures are clear with examples. Although he's a decent lecturer he's not the best at answering questions. Very fair quizzes and exams, they were extremely similar to the homework. Accommodated by dropping 4 quizzes (quizzes are 60% of grade) but no curve. | Flat out I'm not a fan of how he teaches. He explains the process but does not provide real examples. I am however a big fan of his grading process. 13 quizzes(60%) ( one each week on the previous weeks work) a cumulative final (30%) and Hw(10%). No midterms. He also drops the there lowest HW and Quizzes. (actually dropped 4). There was no curve. | he just reads directly off his lecture notes, which are fire tho- he makes them himself so when he reads them during class it's actually helpful because he explains it as he goes. He goes slow and takes breaks for questions but doesn't really answer them lol. Very fair prof and class but p boring, can def skip lecture tho and just read the notes | We get a ton of homework twice a week which is okay but the lectures and his explaining don't much his quizzes. Choose another professor | Quizzes every week which is okay. Tons of homework. Reads from the slides which is the worst way to teach a math class. You have to teach yourself everything at home and also awful handwriting in the notes so you need the book. Quizzes are hard compared to his teaching. | I took linear optimization with him online this semester(Fall 2020) and he is one of the most organized professors I have had hands down. All of the dates for biweekly exams & hw we find out the first day and there aren't any pop quizzes or midterms. Class notes are very organized and easy to read as well as his lectures! The final is super easy! | Teaches more by explanation rather than example. Got A's on the first two exams and then failed the final. He made the final extremely harder than the first 2 exams. Very nice man though. | He is terrible and sucks at being a helpful teacher. | Knowledgeable but not great an conveying information. Has a lot of trouble understanding students' questions and figuring out which parts are confusing them. He tends to respond to questions (albeit rather stupid questions) with a 5 minute explanation about something the student wasn't asking about. Gives easy exams though. Got 100s without trying. | Sahi was nice, but his lectures on even the simplest of topics were convoluted. His two midterms were ridiculously easy (the avg was 90 for both), but the final was harder (avg 68). He posted lecture notes online, and after the first lecture 30/120 students came to lecture. You were fine grade-wise as long as you did the homework. | Really teaches you Linear Algebra. Assigns a lot of homework, which is an easy 10% of your grade (hint: get the solutions manual for $40). Weekly quizes extremely straightforward based off of homework. Exams are also very straightforward. Will do anything to help you succeed, and is a genuinely good professor. Im going to try and take 350 with him. | Wonderful professor. More than willing to help every student succeed. The material he presents is just challenging enough. The exams were proofs straight from the lecture notes, which he posts online. The homework is very challenging and requires a lot of effort, but it helps a great deal when the exams come around. | I feel like this class is horrible no matter the professor, unless you've been writing rigorous math proofs for years. If you go to office hours regularly he can be really helpful, and he's a really nice guy and definitely cares. Ended up with a B+ after working my ass off. Generous curve because everyone sucks at this class. (average was about 60) | I switched my major from math to psychology because of this guy. That should tell you something. | Worst calc teacher at Rutgers. Gives no partial credit and takes more then half the points for very minor errors on exams. Gives out quizzes at least once a week and most people get 0's on them. During lecture he does half of a problem then erases it and says lets do another problem. If you ever get him switch to another professor. | I would not recommend him to anyone. I basically taught myself calc 3. His exams are somewhat fair but he always puts 1 or 2 questions that are not in any of the homeworks and since the exams are out of 50 this really hurts you. He is so a really unfair grader. I would lose points for things that he didnt say to do in the question | if you can teach yourself a difficult subject and have the time, or if you know calculus 3, take this class with him. otherwise save it for an actual professor. | jolly, but practically useless professor. seems very nice and helpful, but isn't at all really. doesn't have much a heart, exams are very tricky and can get intricate. class goes like this: writes down stuff from book, asks if you understand, if not, explains like the book, then class over. don't take him. | Worst professor ever, doesnt explain anything well. difficult exam, that doesnt include anything you do in class. He should not be teaching, period. | Smart guy, awful professor. He is unclear about what you should know. If you want a good grade (or any attention at all) suck up to him about his 2 PhDs and go to office hours. | Awesome lectures! | Makes sure you understand the material, gives very easy and straightforward exams. | Easiest and the most laid back professor for linear algebra. Tries very hard so that his students understand the material | what ever on book he put it on the board, he assume you know the subject that you are taking | No Comments | No Comments | A good teacher. | Guys please please please dont this class with him. he can make your life completely miserable. He is the worst math thing that can ever happen to you. It is sooo not worth the stress. | DOES NOT RESPOND TO E-MAIL..He is the worst worst the worst of all at teaching. During office hours,if u ask him something, he doesn't even get off his seat. He makes you feel really really stupid. please dont take him to find out especially if ur graduating cuz he does not care..HE IS A TOTAL JERK. | He is the worst prof on this planet. He is never there during his office hours and he seems like he wants you to not do well. DONT TAKE HIM... | Definitely one of the worst professors I have ever had. He has no clue how to teach and expects the students to know rediculous amounts of material. The exams were terribly difficult, and included nothing that was discussed in class. Dont take him! | Worst math teacher I've ever experienced. Extremely unhelpful, unclear, and unwilling to help his students understand the class. Wastes time in class, doesn't seem like he knows the material at all. Exams are extremely difficult and don't include hw or class material. Don't take him!!! | No Comments | Excellent for Calc2, but horrible for linear algebra 350. Everything was ""obvious"" and the exams were to prove things that took him a month to prove in lecture. At applied classes, he seems to be very good, but if you have an analysis course, it's better to find another alternative. | He does not belong in teaching! He is lazy in clarifying, fears helping of any kind. He wants to rush responses to students questions but goes 10 minutes over class time to cover extra material. What? His favorite catchphrase is ""Its obvious!"" Please dont join his class to find out what this means! | Very good professor who makes exams and quizzes easy if you're willing to pay attention. Extremely clear and writes all notes on board so students can follow."
"Soffer, Avraham","Very hard to understand in lectures but gives very clear review and tests are quite easy. Best way to take this class is to self study the material and show up to review sessions. | Soffer does a lot of stuff differently than the textbook but you will still get credit on exams if you solve however you want. Know Euler's formula because he loves it. | AVOID!!!! | Good lecturer. Uses methods different than the book, so you really need to go to class. No formula sheets for exams, but partial credit abounds. | Professor Soffer is a good professor because he challenges you to really understand the material and not just memorize formulas. As long as you attend class and take good notes, getting an A is attainable. He loves to use hard complex numbers so make sure to utilize euler's formula. If you are looking for a rewarding experience, take him. | If you are able to do every HW problem, you should be able to get 100s on all the exams. You can either use the method he uses in class or read directly from the book. I prefer the second but both work (his might be better but a little harder to understand). | Exams were easy if you understand the basics. There is more than one way to solve a problem, and you get credit for showing that you can apply the theory, even if you ultimately get the problem wrong. He was very willing to help me out individually and almost had me changing majors from Engineering to Mathematics... | Hated him at first but after 2nd mid term, realized how easy tests were. Dont go to lectures, just go to review sessions rt b4 exams. Doesnt take pts off for algebraic errors. Final exam almost the same as mid terms combined. Didnt have to hand in all hws till the end of the semester since he only collected them to give credit. | you have to teach yourself the material and the tests are really hard. the review session helps a little and the test questions are very similar to the practice problems he does in class so it's important to go to all of the classes. the curve is huge where the A starts around an 80 | Not a terrible person but a not so good professor. He has a thick accent which doesn't help and his test are almost impossible. Most of the questions are based on notes but his notes go all over the place and are hard to follow. Huge curve distribution so if think you failed with a 50 or 60, you probably got an C or B. | Avoid at all costs. | Difficult teacher! Never available for office hours! He is even including a problem on the midterm that the math department deems too difficult to put on the final. My math 300 professor was even confused when I asked him for help; he thought that the class that I was asking for help with was math 311 not 251. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. | ended 421 (fall06) with a B+. Material can be tough and lectures move fast, but attend class and keep up with hw, and you'll be fine. Exams can be tough but he doesn't grade much basic computations --usually checks to see that you got the concepts. Good professor --only problem is he misses lots of lectures and usually isn't present for exams | This professor can not speak very clearly. I am sure that he knows how to do the math himself, but is not able to effectively teach it to students.He goes with a fast pace,and does not explain anything (even though the whole class does not understand him.) He never is available for extra help, and is unreachable for office hours.NOT recommended. | Nice guy, class is not too hard, reading the book definitely helps. No cheat sheets on exams. Missed a lot of lectures though, which ended up being taught even more poorly by grad students. | Extremely difficult accent to understand as a result very unclear. | the book itself teaches better than he does, can't understand him, he says the books wrong and makes up exams/quizes he even says he wouldn't get a 100 on.. i mean wtf is that? don't take him! | No Notes, No Calculators on exams. Tough overall. | A decent exam grade curve, but the exams are tough. Alot of material on any given exam. Sometimes it's hard to understand him too."
"Kopparty, Swastik","I took this class during the Spring 2021 semester(online) and I thought Prof. Kopparty was simply wonderful! He is very chill, goes over every topic well(and none of them are overly challenging FYI) and always does extra problems for those students who need a bit more clarification. If you want to save yourself a lot of stress, go for him! | His lecture is okay. It is not so boring. Sometimes, he would make a joke in his lecture, but nobody laughs. Only a few do laugh. He is a kind person. His lecture is basically about the concept and only a few examples. You have to study on your own if you want to understand more. Use the textbook questions and meet him. He is very helpful. | So I haven't completed my class yet because I have the final for Calculus I for Engrs in two days. I had a good time in this class because he was understanding towards during the COVID-19 pandemic. He always answered questions when the students asked, so we can understand more. If you're going to Engineering or CS, please take him. | The class takes a while to get used to. I remember the first couple weeks I had to use the textbooks, but overtime I got used to the way he teaches and it helped me a lot. He gives hw every week, but overall it prepares you for the midterms and final. On top of all that he's a really nice, funny guy. Best teacher I've had this entire year! | Professor Kopparty is hilarious. He is super nice and very intelligent. He will spend the entire lecture answering questions if that is what it takes for you to understand the concepts. He is clear in his explanations and really wants you to succeed. Take him! | Wow, a Rutgers math prof who gets it!! Genuinely really nice, wants the best for you, and makes exams very reasonable. | He is amazing. I always struggled with theory classes - I didn't do so hot in 205 and I barely passed 206 (that class still gives me nightmares). I was scared when I signed up for this class but, trust me, he explains things very well and is generous with partial credit and grades. If he's teaching automata, register for his section ASAP | The best professor I ever had! He is very helpful and caring about his students. He wants you to learn. Took cs 205 in Spring 2015 with him. He stresses the key points multiple times so when I missed some lectures, I could pick it up quickly. Hw much harder than exams(which is very good). Exams were tough but manageable. Take him if u can. | He's so smart and extremely clear and helpful. If you just pay attention to his lecture, you'll learn everything but you'll honestly be fine learning from the book. Attendance only mandatory for quiz days | Brilliant and sweet professor who really cares about his students. His analogies are fun and helpful in understanding concepts. Homework due every 2 weeks and one question quizzes on the day homework was due. Straightforward grading. | Currently taking Kopparty for 205 and really enjoying it. Exams are easy as long as you understand the homework. Kopparty is always smiling and cracks dumb nerdy jokes all the time (which I love). I highly recommend him. | Class is fairly easy. Kopparty generally goes at a reasonable pace and takes time to answer questions from students. | Amazing professor. Exams are fair and lectures are clear. One of the best professors I had at Rutgers Took him for number theory and learned a lot throughout the semester. Taking him is highly recommended. | He has an incredibly sharp mathematical mind. His lectures are clear and interesting and he understands students well so he responds effectively to questions. He is incredibly nice and wants all of his students to succeed. Homework, quizzes, and the final are all completely fair and are excellent at helping the students learn. Highly recommended! | Prof. Kopparty is brilliant and great at teaching."
"Tunnell, Jerrold","He's a great number theory teacher. He's made several outstanding contributions including Tunnell's theorem on congruent numbers. Learned elliptic curves and FLT from him. Hard problems but very smart man. Respect. | Very inaccessible outside of class and does not respond to emails. Did not give us a clear outline of a course from day 1 (we didnt take a single quiz until we went online, never gave approx dates for exams labs until a week or less than 2 weeks before, etc.). Expect your assignments to be graded late. Condescending when asked questions. | Pretty straightforward lecturer. Typical for his higher level classes, your grade will be equal to the effort you put in. He's not spectacular, but he's not awful, which is already pretty good considering the quality of a lot of pure math professors. Not that much HW, and it accurately reflects what would be on the exam. | He's a nice guy and wants to help, but this is a really difficult class even for Rutgers Honors. He assigns a TON of homework which is due weekly, but if you fall behind he lets you hand it late (credit). The exams are rough and he's pretty strict with the curve - only 3 A's. Unless you love algebra, take with someone else since it is HARD. | doesn't answer your questions. tells you what's on the exam, but when you take the exam, it's different than what he told you. not personable. went to office hours, he never helped, and made me feel really dumb. | They say Calc 2 and 4 are the hardest and Prof. Tunnell makes it impossible! His lectures are boring and he never answer your questions when you don't understand something. He expects everyone to know what they're doing before taking his class. AVOID HIM IF YOU CAN! I used to love Math but he made me hate Calc 2 | Genuinely likes the material that he teaches. If you go to him for help he will definitely help you out. If you ask stupid questions or don't do your work he'll be mean and obnoxious. He's a really hard professor overall and not many people get A's or B's, don't take this class if your looking for a good grade. | I had him for two consecutive semesters. The exams are multiple choice as opposed to the traditional open ended. Each correct multiple choice is about 8 to 9 points and each incorrect multiple choice answer is -3. It is possible to recieve a negative grade for this class; however, the curve is high. No partial credit. | Prof. is probably one of the worst math prof. at rutgers. He just talks and talks without stopping, his notes are useless, his lectures are boring, his handwriting is illegible, his exams are hard, barely any partial credit, points taken off for wrong answers in the MC. Avoid at all costs if you really value your GPA. | Good professor in terms of knowing and loving the math he teaches. Answers questions very thoroughly going to the roots and reasons as to why, but slightly boring accent. He's a tough grader and his exams are so-so. | obnoxious just like most people have said. he has a problem with helping people in general and always tends to think that he should go off on a tangent about why he is right and youre wrong (if you try to ask for something after class). also, WHO DOESNT GIVE PARTIAL CREDIT IN A MATH CLASS. absolutely absurd, he is the laziest prof i have ever had! | Umm, so i stopped going to his lectures because I wanted to knock myself unconscious everytime i did. horrible teacher, loud annoying voice, doesnt stop, 1 hr 20 minutes of straight talking at you, no class interaction, doesnt teach well at all, no partial credit on exams. AVOID IF YOU VALUE YOUR GPA | No Comments | Pretty mean and obnoxious. He will not show any sympathy for you and doesn't care about you at all.His lectures are pretty boring too and I by the halfway point I was usually knocked out, but he does give pretty good notes and is fair when it comes to grading.Just make sure u do all the homework and pray for a good T.A.Hard class but not impossible | He gives pretty good notes, but the class is boring and can put you to sleep. His tests are harder than other calc 2 tests that I have seen. If you do all of your hw and pay attention in class you should be able to at least get a C. To bad it didn't work out that way for me. | failed first two exam, aced the final and ended up with a B. not bad at all imo. probably the only calc 2 teacher worth taking. id recommend him. | Very hard. | k | I enjoy his lecturing style and learned much from his courses. The style has influence my own teaching style. | Kind of obnoxious, but don't take it personally. Pretty fair. | he was good"
"Weibel, Charles","Speaks quietly, writes very small, and is not good at explaining things. Generally messes up proofs half the time and needs to correct himself. Avoid at all costs, you are better off studying the textbook. Almost always has quizzes on the later day of the week, and exams make up 80% of grade: 2 midterms at 20 and final at 40. Gracious curve though. | Professor Weibel is a wonderful person and has a great sense of humor. Age has not been kind to him, as he is far too old to be teaching. He should not be teaching and retiring to his six cats. Avoid taking a course with him. If you must, you can probably get away with reading the textbook. | You can't see what he writes or hear what he speaks, so you have to self study. The textbook problems however you mainly use to self study are very inadequate for the proof heavy exams he gives. | I am a senior and took this class for a tech elective. This is suppose to an easy class but the professor makes it very difficult, and half the time you can't even understand him. He is not clear on topics or doesn't explain them properly. By far the worst professor experience in 4 years of college. | He writes very small, talks very low, and needs to be constantly reminded to write bigger. The midterm was 6 questions and was proof-heavy. The average for the midterm was in the low 50s, one question wasn't even taught yet. Pop quizzes are frequent because people don't attend lectures.TA's a heavy grader and will never comment on what was wrong. | He writes too small even after multiple people told him to write bigger. He also talks very quietly so it's hard to hear him, even after people tell him to talk louder. He gives pop quizzes (and exams) that sometimes have nothing to do with what we learned in class. In order to pass this class u have to learn everything by urself. Avoid his classes | His writing is very small, and he lectures both quietly and quickly. As a result, it is difficult to grasp the concepts during class and you are mostly forced to learn the material in the textbook by yourself. | The professor talks very quietly. He writes very small so if you take his class you must sit in the front row or use your phone camera to zoom into the board. Your grade is mostly determined by your two midterm grades and final so don't freak out if you fail a quiz or miss a homework(don't make it a habit though)."
"Burrin, Claire","Had her for 350Ha(linear algebra) and it was a blast. Very conceptual class but spent the time on computations when it was necessary, yet it never felt like she spent *too* much time on either. The exams never felt impossible, and she would always take the time to go over any difficult problems afterward. This helped tremendously for the final. | There is no textbook, so attendance is de facto mandatory. Homework is short, easy, and is all on the internet. Lectures sometimes lack examples relevant to the homework, and since the homework is short, you may see stuff on exams that was not adequately covered in class/hw. 477 is considered hard, but with her it wasn't so bad. | Students are graded on their ability to solve word problems yet zero class time is dedicated to methods of solving these word problems. Rather lectures are spent deriving formulas used in the solutions of these word problems that can be found in the textbook. | Doesn't seem very knowledgeable about the subject. Lectures are pretty hand wavy. Does a pretty good job of giving a conceptual idea of whats going on but can't rigorously explain the material. Pretty easy class if you show up and learn the motions but don't expect to learn probability very deeply. | I took her for Abstract Algebra I. It was a fun class with lots of discussion. As with almost any level math class, You need to be a class to understand the material. And expect weekly homework. Professor Burrin is a good professor who is very approachable if you have questions, either during class, after class, or during office hours. | Took her for intro to abstract alg. She's very clear, gives a lot of examples, and responds to any questions(there were some kids in my class that were completely clueless and she was still patient with them). Kinda seems like she hates teaching, but other than that, it was a great class. | ��She's great honestly. | I do not understand the way she explains things. She does not give exercises during class... It is hard to use materials to do exercise. Difficult. | Really good"
"Gupta, Purvi","Not a big fan of her teaching style and couldn't understand the material from the first day of the class. She is really approachable outside of class but the homework and exams are hard as hell. Cannot tolerate her accent as well. | I personally had an incredibly difficult time. I normally do well as a math major but this was the first time I received a low grade like this. She teaches really fast and the methods are all over the place. The class average on exams was always so low while sections w different professors did much better. Truly upsetting. Survived on a curve. | I think this is her first time teaching this class, but I really enjoyed it. The exams are not easy by any means, but they're also not impossible and she gives opportunities to make up some questions. Overall very happy. | Actually managed to make me excited about Calculus 2. I think that speaks for itself. | Purvi's very sweet, understanding, and just a lovely person to work with. She went over the material clearly and concisely. Exams were fair. Her office hours are excellent (go to all of them!). Also wanted to second the fact that she has a cute hop in her step during lecture. Overall a serious breath of fresh air for the math department. | After having a terrible Calc 1 professor, I was blessed with Purvi. She makes the material as clear as possible and teaches in a very clear, organized, and easy to follow manner. She makes Honors Calc 2 manageable even though it's supposed to be the hell class. Also is young and energetic, literally has a hop in her step. | Not only is Purvi great at math, she is excellent at conveying her vast information to her students in a way that is very understandable. Even in a tougher subject than most of us are used to she somehow finds a way to teach us in an effective way. Also she has a cute accent and sometimes she does this cute hop-jump when moving across the board. | Very clear and concise. She makes time out her class for you and it is easy to find her. She is polite and she makes calc 2 less of a hell class. | She's a very caring professor and eager to help anyone understand the material. She doesn't overload on homework and her exams are straight forward. I would definitely take another class of hers, she makes the material interesting."
"Goldstein, Sheldon","Prof Goldstein is very chill. Hw wasn't graded, and exams were fair; but prepare unfortunately for a lot of self learning. He lectures on the chalkboard, and for me his handwriting was too light to see. There were two midterms, one final, and a few quizzes. Take him if you're a good self-studier who prefers little interference and a chill prof. | The Hws are worth nothing and you heavily based on quizzes and tests which one screw up can ruin your entire grade. The final was really long but was half based on prior tests and the prof hand writings were not the best and it was really hard to understand him when he spoke. If you take him be prepared for pop quizzes because at the end they count | No graded homework, so the exams are the only grades you get. Graded pop quizzes every two weeks or so. Messy handwriting and likes to go theory/proof heavy. Otherwise, a passionate guy with a wry sense of humor. Lin Alg as a topic is very easy. Do the work, read the textbook, and be prepared at every lecture to get an A. Else, easy B. | The presentation of material is awful, he writes illegibly all over the blackboard and stands at the front of class and paraphrases the textbook. Never does any calculations or offers insight on how to solve a problem we might see. The class feels 100% self taught, and he goes so fast that nobody bothers to ask questions in his small lecture room. | 2 Midterms, 1 Final. 4 Pop Quizzes worth 20% of your grade. Pop quizzes are unfair since if you're not fully caught up on the material you're doomed. Professor expects you to self teach the material by reading the textbook and doing the problems. Lectures are unorganized, scribbles on the board, and talks most of the time. Performs no calculations. | Pretty chill dude, I think he did the best he could explaining the concepts of quantum mechanics considering how weird a topic it is, but I wish he went over the math in better detail. I don't recommend taking this class unless you have some prior knowledge of quantum mechanics (Schrodinger equation, wave function, probability, etc.) | Professor Goldstein is an incredible physicist who is very caring and helpful. He will explain the same concept over and over until you understand it, he wants you to learn! The course consists of 5 quite difficult HWs which could take a long time to figure out (he will go over them in class), a midterm which is the 5 HWs combined, and a final. | Took him for 454 and it was a good decision. The class was pretty easy and his presentation of the material is good. You might go over some tedious examples in class and on the (optional) homework, but thankfully he never gives anything that bad on the quizzes and exams. Only downside was the 50% weight for the final exam (2nd midterm was canceled) | Professor Goldstein is a great professor! His lectures were great! His class is difficult, but very rewarding. Be prepared to read the textbook on your own, as there is almost an expectation that you know the material before lectures. He grades very fairly; for our class, the cutoffs for A/B+/B were at most 85/80/60, respectively. | Professor Goldstein is a good lecturer and really funny! For 477, it seemed his section was a bit harder than the other sections, but overall I found it manageable. Be prepared to see him speak in acronyms. Also, beware of pop quizzes-you don't want to miss them because they count for 80% of the grade. Grading is pretty fair: 85/80/60 for A/B+/B. | Hes a really good professor and curves really well. Only problem is his online teaching isnt as great as it probably is in person solely because of his handwriting, but if you have a chance to take him in person, I would. | Easy B class but hard to get grades above this. His lectures are fine but super bad handwriting. He is the most experienced professor at RU teaching this course. | Definitely not your typical math class, heavy focus on physics and a dose of philosophy. Material was fairly difficult but the HW has reasonable problems. Super interesting topic, but it was hard to follow lectures. Exams were definitely doable if you reviewed the HW and lectures, but would not take if you are not super interested in the topic. | He is one of the worst math professors I've had thus far. I think this is because of the online format-- as he seems he would be a really great teacher in person, but DO NOT TAKE HIS ONLINE CLASS. He answers questions rudely, and this is never helpful. He seemed like a really great guy, is a genius, but his online class was not fun. | He's condescending and rude, which makes me never want to ask questions, even though I need to. Didn't know what to expect out of Quantum Mechanics, but it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. Then again, I'm not really a physics person. If you're not a physics person, don't take it. If you do, study the HW! The class is trash online. | Don't blink during lecture or you'll be lost and unable to decipher his poorly scribbled acronyms and abbreviations. Midterm and final were incredibly easy copy/pastes of the in class pop quizzes. Just study the quizzes and you'll be fine. (memorize the quizzes...) | Time consuming class. Must put in the work. 60+ is a B. He is nice, simplifies material a lot, but goes pretty fast. 3 hw problems due every cls. Do all hw probs, go over examples/hw problems he does in cls, memorize the textbook-exam is honestly not too bad if you study a lot. Take him!He is a lot easier than other professors! Helpful in office hr | Didn't know what to expect in a Quantum Mechanics course, but he made it pretty manageable and interesting. He gave out paper copies of his lecture notes which was really helpful if you happened to miss a class. There were only about 6 assignments for the whole semester and the final was worth 50% of your grade, so be careful not to mess them up. | For Math477, he's the one. I'm gonna miss geeky jokes and his cheeky grin. Oh, he writes so fast and teaches so fast like there is no tomorrow. Final is just the compilation of midterms. His uniqueness ? hmm... ACRONYM (if you took his class, you know what I mean) | Favorite class thus far, probability definitely one of the more interesting areas of math. Many reviews complain about the difficulty, but honestly it's pretty fair. I'm only a business major, no math whiz and this was my first/only math course at college (stat minor). Goldstein gives exceptional lectures and a 60+ is a B while 85+ is A. | He is probably the worst professor that I ever had at Rutgers... He does'nt clearly explain the material precisely, gives extremely complicated homework assignments, and he talks so fast till the point that what he says overlap, to the point that I really can't understand him. Worst of all he writes very sloppy on the board. | His class is super-early, and homework is due at every BEGINNING OF CLASS. The only part I like in his class is cracking down the jokes. He is a good lecturer, but he does not do much helpful examples in class, which makes homework problems hard. His exam are comprehensive and fair, so make sure you know everything! Not easy to get a B+, beware! | My fav math prof, very funny and always willing to help. If you need help GO TO OFFICE HOURS! It helps a lot and I wish I went more. Good curve on tests and participation is considered. HW due every class but alot of it is part of the exam so pay attention when he goes over it in class. Just wish his handwriting was better and he erased board fully | Terrible handwriting. Must submit homework before lecture. | He rushes a lot through the material. Bad handwriting. Very disorganized. | If you want a real understanding of the subject and want to really earn an A, this is your class. Otherwise, you can do tolerably and get a B range grade. Prof Goldstein is also well known and knowledgeable, very willing to spend time with you and answer questions. | If you want a professor where you can learn from lecture and get an easy B, take professor Goldstein. His exams are straightforward, and he gives great curves on each exam. Though 477 is a hard class, Goldstein will make it less difficult than what you expect. Homework is due every lecture | Hard class. Professor was very helpful, especially during office hours; wish I would have gone more as I probably could have gotten an A. Exams are reasonable given the topic, but the topic itself is EXTREMELY difficult, especially during the latter portion of the semester. If you take Math 477 take it with Goldstein; you might not pass otherwise. | Subject material is pretty hard and pretty dry. Sheldon teaches pretty well, but doesn't have the best handwriting. | Best teacher! Made a difficult subject easy to understand. Homework due every class but really helps. If you go to class and actually listen to him, you'll definitely pass. Exams are fair and definitely doable. Extremely helpful. He's adorable! | Professor Goldstein knows the material really well. Also, he's super corny and it's fun to be in lecture. The material was not my favorite, but it was still intriguing enough. Tests are fair and entirely straightforward; the probability of you tripping yourself up is greater than the probability of you not knowing something on the exam. | He definitely knows the topic of Probability really well. He explains things well, and always shows us how to save time on problems by thinking about them differently. I just wish that what he wrote on the board was a bit neater. Otherwise great professor, and great class. | Extremely intelligent, a little offbeat, down to earth. Will assist with any problems if asked. Great professor. | I failed the class, but the professor was awesome. He walks very fast, and writes messy, and cracks awesome jokes. What else can you ask for in a professor? Wish the class wasn't so early and I'd done the homework, probably would have been an easy A. | He rushes a lot through tons of material and doesn't erase the board thoroughly which can be a huge pain. If you need help, go to his office hours from the beginning, he'll explain whatever you need. Pay attention to the hwk problems he goes over in class and the solutions that he puts online. Exams are straightforward. He'll grade on improvement. | He cracks jokes and tries to keep things interesting, which is great compared to most math professors. But, he rushes so fast through so much material, I usually ended up zoning out anyway. Also, the textbook was impossible to learn from. Study with the homework (re: the solutions he posts online) and the tests aren't a big deal. | I like this class so far. The exams are pretty straightforward and he's an entertaining lecturer. A little messy when he writes on the board but that's about the worst thing I can say about him."
"Cuello, William","Professor Cuello super funny and nice! There were recorded lectures before time and class time was office hours and breakout rooms. Curve was very big at end of the class and he very generous with points. tests were okay but if you did the homework and problems it was fine. | He is a very humble and caring professor. Put in enough efforts, and you will ace the class. His lectures are well-structured and easy to follow. He also posted his lectures on YouTube for the online semester. Overall an easy A if you put in the efforts. Just do the HW assignments and go to his lectures and you will be fine. | His inexperience showed, but I know he'll get better at it. Was self aware of this and did his best to grade fairly as a result. Did learn a bit, could've been much harder if he wanted it to be. Study the homework problems and previous exams and you'll be okay | He is a nice dude in general and considerate for his students. He likes to play with exams with lots of calculus stuff so be sure to review these stuff. As long as you do the homework, go to lecture and office hour, you should be fine. | Professor Cuello did a great job. The tests were extremely fair if you are good at calculus and algebraic manipulation. If you understand what independent and identically distributed RVs are, you will do great. Know integration by parts. The curve was huge for those who struggled; however you wont need it if you are skilled in the above. | 8:40 AM classes were difficult to attend, but would do it for Professor Cuello. He's a tough, but fair grader, and he genuinely cares about his students. You do have to study the material and understand it well, not just do homework problems. There's a curve and he makes sure it's fair as well. Really enjoyed his lectures. | Willy C is a funny guy. He knows how to pace the course properly. Unfortunately, Math 481 is an extremely boring and dry subject. Hopefully, Willy gets more interesting courses to teach in the future. On another note, very few homeworks and not much work for them. First exam was super tough but he let us replace the grade. | Very inexperienced. Exams were waaaay too difficult and the material was not what we learned in lecture. Students who did relied on what they learned from other courses. Lectures were just readings of the textbook in a confusing manner. He means well, but is simply not an effective teacher."
"Pham, Triet","Inconsiderate professor and lectures were not informative | Is not understanding and is not accommodative | NOT accessible outside of class and takes forever to respond if he ever even responds. Lectures are really bad because you can't hear him even in the front row and he messes up the example problems all the time. His class was so bad that my friends and I had to start going to another professor's class. Is really difficult with accommodations!!!!!!! | Amazing Professor. Professor Pham has a vast amount of knowledge to share. I am honored I got to take his class and had the chance to take a glimpse of his brilliance. | One of the best professors in the Math department. He is really nice and caring and actually knows his stuff. Does not bring any notes to class and writes everything on the board from memory. I would say exams and HW are really fair, the exams are usually quite similar to HW. Make sure you know how to do the HW and class examples and you are good! | A lot of people are afraid of Math 152 (Calc 2) at Rutgers for some reason, but Professor Pham makes it digestible and attainable for his students. You have to attend lecture though, since everything he teaches is in-person and he gives lots of examples that reflect what is on quizzes and tests. You have to put time into it, but it's not bad! | Amazing professor. Math 485 can be challenging and it has hard topics, Pham makes it understandable. Make sure you attend lecture. | Took his class over the summer. Fair grader, especially since all our exams were entirely based on homework. If you study the homework, you pass (at least for the summer class). His lectures were clear and easy to follow, especially considering how quickly he taught the chapters. I would definitely take him again during a fall/spring semester. | Do I think Triet Pham is an incredibly good professor? Yes, he is very approachable outside of class and will attempt to make concepts easier then. Do I think the class with him teaching it was good? No. Calc 2 is very computation heavy, and that is where I struggled. Theoretically, he explained concepts very well, but not how to SOLVE them. | For those who are sequential and need every step to be written, you will struggle like me. He skips a lot of steps in lectures. He is very fair, responsive, and absolute. Remember he teaches Calc II, the least coherent, least formulaic, and most memorization and pattern-recognition driven Calculus. Harsh subject, but not a harsh guy. Remember that. | I struggled in this class (354) but I learned a lot. He makes the material very interesting, even if the material seems a bit trivial in the beginning. Don't take this class if you want an easy A, but if you want to challenge yourself and grow, this is the class for you. | Never choose his class. It seems that He did not prepare for class, because most of time, he stopped and found something wrong. Then he check textbook for help. There is no curve. He will not give average for exams. There are a lots of tough homework. Exams are tough and have nothing to do with homework. | Prof Pham was not personally a helpful professor. His class was difficult. It was very difficult to ask questions as he didn't get back to students. Expects students to pick up his class quickly. I'd recommend not taking this professor. | Had him twice, once for MAT311 too. Very good, really passionate about what he is teaching, and willing to answer questions and address confusions. Key: respectful, but very blunt. A lot of people strongly dislike him, mistaking his bluntness as rudeness, but I think most of these people just have really big egos or want easy As, etc | This class is difficult, he makes it clear at the very beginning of the semester. But Professor Pham is an excellent instructor, he provides as much help as he possibly could. The problems he gives (hw/lecture/exams) are fun. Go to the office hours. There are also coding for extra credits. If you like Math, you will like taking this class with him. | Very challenging class but Professor Pham explains things well. You just need to spend time reading the textbook or staring at the solutions to absorb everything. He also is very willing to help you understand outside of class. Exams are problems done in class/hw, but you need to go to lecture for attendance (10% of grade) which is a good motivator | Professor Pham was the best. Alot of other people in my class did not like him but He is a very reasonable and passionate professor. He really cares about what he is teaching and his assessments are designed very similarly to the homework. His ""quizzes"" were also very good, they were just class examples graded on completion. | prof pham is homie! i really liked 481 definitely not the easiest material but prof pham goes over examples in class and hw/quizzes prepare you well for the exams. a lot of the material tests your math foundation. would take again | If you're really good at Stats and have a very strong math background, u can consider taking upper-level math courses with him. Otherwise, take those courses with other easier professors. | Class was run like a typical math class. Lectures were somewhat disordered because of the virus situation. Tests were relatively easy for a math class, but lectures went quite deep into theory. No real surprises on tests/quizzes. If you listen in class and do homework you should do well. | His lecture style was hard to follow; if you got distracted for a minute you'd be completely lost. HW and exams were mostly computation. If you wanted to learn the theory behind the math he went into it more in lectures, but you could get by just learning how to do textbook problems | Professor Pham's exams and quizzes were all essentially homework problems. If you take the time to do the homework, you will get an A. He is a pretty good lecturer as well. Overall, your not going to find many better options in the RU math department. | Great professor, notes were a little messy at times but most of the time, he answered every question a student asked | Overall not a bad choice. The material itself is not the easiest. Just don't skip the lectures and do every homework and you'll be fine. | The examples he gives in class and the assigned hw are often not so related to the quizzes and exams, which is very confusing. And there is a quiz every week. Be ready to study hard for his class. | He is one of the greatest math professors at Rutgers! He knows how to teach, which is better than a lot of other professors and is good for students. He is really really caring. If you have any questions about the subject or you are looking for math advice, please go talk to him. He's really helpful. He'd even love to chat with you on other topics. | The class is the most boring class i have ever taking, the teacher is okay but his teaching method is so monotonous. Doing the same thing in and out on a routine | I really enjoy Pham's unique sense of humor, but I am not a big fan of him making tons of computational mistakes during the lecture. He should also work on his handwriting. Make sure u understand the examples that he goes over in class cuz they will show up on the exam. | Pham is a pretty good lecturer, and you can really tell that he knows the material very well. He tends to move somewhat fast in lecture, but it is manageable as long as you stay engaged. Attendance is mandatory, but it provides a good grade cushion. Exams are very straightforward and easy as long as you know how to do the HW problems. | Good professor. Gives time to try sample questions in class. Tests are very fair and there are no surprises on them either. There is no curve for this class though. If you can do all the homework you will do fine. | Super chill. He cares about the material a lot but he doesnt impose his will on you like some other professors. Periodically just says interesting things that wont be on the test. Homework was optional. | Prof. Tried is a nice guy. | He's a great lecturer, and he genuinely cares for his students. I had a panic attack on his first exam, and I didn't do so well. After proving my knowledge of the content by doing significantly better than the class average on the second exam, he curved my grade. Moves through material fast, take advantage of office hours. | Good lecturer. There are times when he is a bit confusing but the tests are very fair and he always tells us what to expect. | Great professor for 477. Good pace, explains concepts well, does plenty of examples on the board. Exams are not easy but there is a sizable curve since the material is difficult. | He makes his own lecture notes. They are better than the text. | HE IS THE NICEST GUY ON EARTH AND CUTE :) | He is a great professor!!!"
"Weston, Kimberly","Lectures build off of each other so you need to have a solid understanding of basic concepts before moving on. Homework is harder but the tests are 80% of your grade. Prof is very sweet and will spend the time explaining concepts to you in office hours. I have no background in math/stats so this was extremely difficult but a good class for me. | Make sure you pay attention during lectures, as the later lectures build up. HW is more difficult than the exams. The exam is concept heavy and requires simple computations. If you don't know, still attempt as she's generous with partial credit. Prof. Weston is a great professor and answers questions effectively. Effort definitely yields results. | HW is way harder than the tests. Lectures have many examples from textbook. Grading is pretty fair and she was very nice and gave many chances for everyone. There were 4 midterms, each took half a lecture, and you could be graded by 3 different ways, always 20% for HW plus one of 50% midterms 30% final, 30% midterms 50% final, or full 80% final. | Her lectures are pretty engaging and she's good at explaining things. The exams aren't that difficult. She doesn't usually give the hardest problems on exams. Flexible grading structure. 4 ""midterms"" + 1 final. | If you are not a math major or have no background in statistics/probability, DO NOT take this course or you will probably struggle A LOT. This is not an intro course. Very intensive and difficult course. And Professor is very organized but tends to just copy notes on board which is boring. However, she is VERY nice and will curve you if you need it | I love her. She's calm, cool, and VERY generous with partial credit! Her voice is soothing -- she's like our mom. Her lectures are also amazingly concise. One day, a spider fell from the ceiling and she smoothly walked up to it and very calmly said ""you shouldn't be here"". Then, she elegantly squished it. Foot eased in, then eased out. Elegant. | Professor Weston is caring, friendly, organized, and an alright lecturer. She is responsive and offers ample extra help. Her homework and exams are quite difficult; however, she is very very reasonable when grading. If you understand the concept, you'll get most of the points. Your effort definitely fairly translates to your grade in this class. | i cannot emphasize this enough- TAKE HER CLASS. literally changed my life. prof weston is hands down the best professor ive had at rutgers she made the class about the learning rather than the grade- i was super scared for math300 but she explains topics v v well in class and i completely understood all the material! not just a teacher but a bestie"
"Reynolds, Guy","I took 111 during my SEBS EOF program and was assigned Guy as my professor. He's amazing. He teaches you how to ""read"" math and truly tries his best to help you succeed. He also loves to crack jokes. He helped me understand what I was ready for and what I wasn't, and I couldn't ask for a better math teacher. TAKE HIS CLASS!!! | Guy was my recitation prof for Precalc 112. He helped a lot when explaining concepts I didn't understand and he would go over what would be on the weekly quizzes. He has great energy (especially for 12:10 on a Friday) and is very open to questions. I would recommend taking him for recitation if you can! (I got a D because of lecture not recitation) | He was my recitation teacher and made math a little less stressful with his silly jokes and great energy. He explained everything very well before our quiz every week and overall is a great professor. I definitely recommend! | Guy is a good professor. Very easy going guy with a good sense of humor. 026 with Guy was easy. His exams and quizzes are very easy once you recognize what's going on, but easy victories can lead to a big defeat in the final. He also taught pretty slow, but mainly because he goes into a lot of detail. Take him! | Keeps the class entertaining by being lively, cracking jokes, and other antics. Reviews for quizzes during recitation and the quizzes are straightforward, really hard to not get at least 8/10 on all quizzes unless you don't pay attention. | Guy is pretty funny. Each week we have a quiz and he literally tells us exactly what we need to know for the quiz. If you don't pay attention in the actual lectures by your lecturer, than the quizzes will be harder than it's supposed to be, especially when Guy is very helpful when it comes to going over each question from the worksheet in class | Very chill professor. Brings down the pressure of calc a lot because he's so laid back but still explains everything well. He simplifies the concepts and makes them feel really familiar to you so that you feel more competent doing the work. Tells you what concepts will be on the quiz. Cracks funny jokes. He's amazing | Guy Reynolds started his class by calling his entire class snowflakes and wants his students to fail. We were told that the second exam was made so that we would be in the 65 range and refuses to curve any exams. The average score of the second exam was a 46.7 and the final average was a 43.2 with the highest score being a 68. Do not take his class | he's an okay professor. the homework he gives can be helpful when it comes to the quizzes but he fails to prepare you for the exams. overall, the class is very boring and he makes bad jokes. | Great guy | I had Professor Reynolds as my T.A. this semester, and I really appreciated having him as my T.A, as he made the class much more bearable and easier to understand. He often taught us tricks to problems that allowed us to figure out the answers much more easily and in more time-effective forms. He was such a cool professor, and extremely good at it. | Had G. Reynolds as my TA and he was wonderful. Great guy who made sure student participated in recitation. Broke pre-calc down to a basic level and worked his way up. Again amazing Professor/TA and person! | Professor Reynolds is an amazing guy outside of teaching; I had an A for all homeworks and quizzes, but failed the exams and the final because what he had been teaching did not match up or prepare me for them at all. I would NOT recommend taking him unless you're already good at math and don't need to depend on the prof to learn the material!! | Guy is a real gem, he is very clear during his lectures and does not want to or let anyone fail. He doesn't teach you how to automatically do math but the reasoning behind it and why you're doing what you're doing which is super helpful for exams. Class isn't exam heavy, and he has a lot of tiny grades so it's really hard not to pass. | I had Reynolds as a TA and he was wonderful. If you miss a quiz and email him or talk to him in person, he gets back to you right away and is very accomodating. Prof. Reynolds is very good at explaining problems and he really does try to make sure everyone understands. He also is very lively and cracks a lot of jokes. | Prof. Reynolds is THE nicest professor I've ever had. He is really funny and makes math interesting. He helps his students succeed by giving take home quizzes and easy HW. I can't recommend a better professor. IF YOU CAN, TAKE HIS CLASSES!!! | Guy is really great. He was just the recitation instructor this semester but he's so fun and he understands the topics really well. He makes class lively and tells so many jokes. Super nice & he always gives you as much credit as he can (with recitation quizzes) if you contact him and make your case. Overall a really great instructor. | Great guy (no pun intended) & professor! He breaks down the problems skip by skip, and he makes the quizzes as easy as possible (only if you pay attention to the lecture before the quiz)! Rutgers or Middlesex, you'll be blessed to have him as your professor! | really really dope professor. you forget you're in a math class. Really reasonable and you can advocate for the grade you want and he'll listen. Make sure you ask questions because he always prioritizes his students over his agenda. Which is a good thing imo. Also, visit office hours because he is the best explainer ever. | Professor Reynolds is an amazing teacher! He is extremely helpful and genuinely cares for his students. His exams were definitely easier than other professors, but that doesn't help overall. Didn't feel prepared for the final at all. Exam was rather difficult. Get ready to study!! | Professor Reynolds is an extremely nice guy don't get me wrong. I found his material not hard at all, but the way he taught did not prepare me for the final, which counts so much for this course. I did well on his stuff throughout the semester but bombed the final because he did not prepare us as much as other classes. Very very hard course. | Calc is a hard class no matter what, but his midterms were easier than other profs and he was really nice and approachable. His lectures were never too boring because he used to engage everyone by joking around and by giving us cookies for the difficult sections | Awesome Prof! I am glad that he taught our section this semester. Midterms were easy, and he motivated us to keep study and use all the resources available to study. His office hours were very helpful as well. He is a funny dude and always made jokes. Brought cookies to motivate us when we were learning difficult sections lol! | Guy is such a great dude, his lectures were funny and he kept you from getting bored. Midterms were def easier than other professors and he knows what he is talking about. He brings in cookies for the class too! | Professor Reynolds is an amazing math teacher wherever and whenever you are in his class. Do not miss a wonderful professor's lecture. It is full of knowledge, wisdom and fun. Moreover, he is a very good, wonderful and excellent human being. :) | Reynolds is good at explaining the big picture, he knows what he's talking about. Also he makes calc 1 fun because he's a funny dude. Compared to other Calc 1 teachers at Rutgers his tests are definitely easier."
"Harris, Lynn","TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! She's lenient with homework deadlines & gives extensions if needed. Posts lecture notes & practice exams on Canvas that are useful for exams. Explains concepts well and always welcomes questions. Beyond that, she's kind and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. Overall makes a challenging subject like math feel much more doable. | Pay attention and follow along during lectures, and study for a couple hours before exams and you'll be good. People complain about how hard this class is but you look around lecture and half the people have their heads down in their phones. You get the grade out depending on the effort you put in. She's an amazing professor! | I took the one semester Precalc and although this is not an easy class, Proff Harris is super sweet and willing to help you if you don't understand the material. However, there is a lot of homework on WebAssign and you need to do good on the 3-4 exams to pass this class. Ended with a B, but should have gotten an A bc I studied so much :( | She is one of the best profs! I would highly recommend her; she cares about her students and wants them to succeed. The class is very test-heavy, but reviewing the test/quizzes with her or your recitation leader is super helpful. Attendance is not mandatory but I would recommend going because she will notice if you're there or not :) | Professor Harris is the sweetest and most caring professor I had this semester! Lectured/recitations are not mandatory. Recommended go to them to do well in this course. She is always willing to help you understand the material so take advantage of that. This course is easy if you put the work into it, however I did not and my grade reflects that. | I didn't take her in college but I took her in high school and she was WONDERFUL! Best math teacher i've ever had and would love to go back to her class. She made me like math for the first time and was always very kind and helpful. Just so amazing truly. Love you | I can't speak on the lecture besides, attendance isn't taken except for recitations. All recitations had a short 3-4 question quiz, which was the attendance. Decently explains math concept,s and the tests were relatively light as long as you knew your stuff. Solid Professor. | Take this professor! She is the kindest professor I've ever had. I am very unskilled in math, but her lectures are clear, organized and very well explained. She cares about her students and is very happy to help those struggling. | Very nice lady but this class was brutal. | Very kind and courteous | Very good pre calc teacher and very helpful, the way she teaches pre calc 1 is very easy to understand, shes lenient with homework deadlines and accessible out of classroom, if you do not understand something her office hours will also help you. For exams she posts various practices and most of them end up being on the exam. 10/10"
"Bifulco, Christina","very good math teacher and very knowledgeable. found the class challenging but in a good way. definitely learned a lot in this class. lessons are watched on ur own time the night before class but are very easy and only graded on completion. liked having in class time for practice problems to ask questions. always provides help and assistance. 10/10 | For starters, she is a really nice person but, even though she is nice, her teaching skills aren't good, she barely teaches the class, the quizzes are kinda hard, but, for me, as a student, I rather she taught us in class and learn the material in depth than do the webassigns since learning the material in class is helpful and understanding. | She was a nice person. However, she didn't teach at all. She went over two problems in class then made us do our homework for the whole hour and a half by ourselves, running around helping multiple students. We had to turn in Pre-Class work before every class, also we had assignments due every other class. Don't recommend. I dropped. | Dr. Bifulco was a great person, but at average professor at the most. Quiz every class, 1 midterm, and 1 final. Heavy HW due before every class too. Barely taught in class, only went through 2 problems and then moved onto independent work where only she and the TA would walk around helping in a class with about 15 kids. Poor teaching tecnhiques."
"Uppuganti, Lakshmi Sowjanya","I had this professor for online calculus. Her syllabus was completely incorrect - did not line up with canvas dates. She did not grade labs until the end of the very short term. She does not return your test - only the test answer key, so it is impossible to find out how you did exactly or where you lost points. There are group projects. AVOID! | She cut grades for not using her method even if the answer is right. Clearly not recommended. | I would never ever recommend this professor to anyone. Doesnt even give credit for work we do in test and exam if the answer is wrong. She makes the subject harder than it actually is. Don't know how to teach. My grades suffered because of her despite the fact that I am good at math and scored very well the previous semester. | She is a very nice person, but she is too quiet and she is not very clear and concise when she teaches, in the sense that she is very scattered while teaching and it makes you lose focus easily. She spends a lot of time on a topic too. She was okay. | Professor Sowjanya is the best math prof I've ever had. Really wants her students to do well. | Professor Sowjanya is really great. She really explains everything well and in depth. You'll do well so long as you do the homeworks and show up. The tests aren't bad either. You also have opportunities to redo test problems if you don't do as well as you wish. She's a really good professor and I wish I could take her again next semester. | Professor Sowjanya, as she likes to be called, goes very slowly, and explains the most basic things, learned in elementary school, for half of a class. She is very lenient and if you miss homework, you can ask her for an extension. | Good professors, goes slow enough and walks you through everything. Very clear and other comment references her accent but I promise she is a great professor and easy to understand. I am really not good at math and I didn't feel stressed in her class. | She's hard to understand. Her voice is is quiet and she has an accent. The class was so difficult to follow. I love math and she made me feel the opposite in this class! I highly recommend to find another professor"
"Gonet, Sophia","she is an amazing calc professor. i don't understand why she's getting so much hate. just pay attention, actually try on the hw, and 100% recommend going to her office hours. she's so kind + patient and wants to see us succeed. she's strict but only if ur being annoying + obnoxious (which i'm sure most of you aren't) take her if you can! | She's honestly the best math professor I've ever had. Even though I took this course in high school already, she was able to help me understand concepts I struggled with before. She's so helpful, sweet, and caring that it's easy to approach her. Her lectures are worth going to since she's very thorough with the material. | Professor Gonet was extremely helpful and kind throughout the entire semester. Her lectures were very clear and her notes were very helpful. Recitation was extremely helpful and the practice sheets always reflect similar criteria on the exams. Her office hours were useful and she is great at explaining the material. Definitely recommend! | Literally SO sweet and really tries to help you understand. The whole 1 hour 20 min lecture usually consists of some notes and then only 2-4 practice problems because she goes so in depth and gives time to process/copy stuff down so it's easy to understand if you pay attention. Only reason I didn't get an A was because I choked on the final. | Gonet is a lovely and kind woman through and through. Her lectures are INCREDIBLY clear and concise. If you can't understand her notes, there is no hope for you. She was very clear about what was going to be on exams and tried to explain things in less complicated ways when she could. She always cracked jokes in class and had a good time too. | She's an amazing prof. Attendance is mandatory but not really counted in final grade. Quizzes are easy if you care even like 50% and lecture notes are thorough/easy to understand. She goes through it slow and explains everything. She may seem intimidating but is very nice. Lecture can get boring but is worth it. Exams are medium hard(study guide!) | Attendance is mandatory but lectures are SUPER important. The way she teaches is helpful too. Notes are posted online. Recitation quizzes are easy if you do the worksheets before class. Exams are difficult so review notes thoroughly. She will give study tips if you need help. Prof Gonet wants to see everyone succeed so she can be stern at times. | Professor great at clearly explaining the topics and recitation quizzes are easy if you go through and understand the recitation problems. | This prof is not hard at all, the course can be intimidating but this prof is the best possible prof you can have for this course. She explains everything so eloquently and really makes you understand the topics. If you're confused in lecture and ask her a question, she will take time to address it and make sure you understand everything clearly. | Prof. Gonet was really good at explaining the concepts and cares about your understanding of the material. Go to her office hours, she will help you as best she can! The midterms and the final are challenging but she does a great job of reviewing the types of problems that will be on them the class before. She can be a bit rude at times though. | Some of these reviews are absolutely wild. AMAZING teacher. Very accommodating, down to earth, and respectable. She can be stern sometimes, but that's only because she's looking out for you, as corny as that may sound. Lectures are mandatory but the lectures are great and she will frequently go over problems you see on midterms/final exams. | I was having issues leaving a review for this professor so i will just make it short. LITERALLY FLAWLESS. Amazing at teaching, clarifies everything, wants the best for us as her students. I'm so happy that I have had the privilege to be in her class this semester! | She provides a lot of resources to help you succeed on the tests and I think she does a really good job of explaining the content. I can understand why people may think her tone is rude, but I think that might just be the way she talks. In my experience, she's always been supportive and helped me whenever I've had a question. | I'm not sure why she has bad ratings. She goes over practice problems every class, which are super helpful since the exams are similar. She's always available to help, too. The midterms were tough but fair, though the final was much harder. Overall, if you're willing to put in the effort, you'll do fine. | she is incredibly rude and not understanding of any circumstances. she treats us more like robots than people. do not in any shape form or manner even think about taking her. the class isn't that hard but i can't learn with a teacher who shows no sympathy towards her students. | I strongly dislike her attitude and demeanor. She's fine at teaching but when it comes to caring about her students she does not. | My experience was disappointing and frustrating. From the start, she created a classroom environment that felt more hostile than supportive. Whenever students asked questions, she often responded in a rude and condescending tone, making it uncomfortable for us to seek help. AVOID TAKING HER!!!!! | Please beware of this professor. As someone who has a job to teach and work with students, who have a million things going on in their life, this professor is the least compassionate and honestly rudest professor I have every come in contact with at Rutgers. She doesn't treat students like they're human, she is not understanding whatsoever. | Please ignore the bad reviews and take Prof Gonet's class. She's an amazing lecturer and her grades are more than fair. The quizzes she gives are basically everything given on the recitation and if you tried, it shouldn't be too difficult. She offers constant help and goes at an even pace and answers questions perfectly. | Professor had great notes which may help understand the topics, but come exam time, there was always an unexpected twist, so you have to self study harder versions of the problem. | I took 152 With Prof Gonet but that wasn't an option to select hence it says Math 135 Prof Gonet extremely strict when it came to grading policies. She also is probably the best professor for this class. You need to study outside of class though, and grind through the lecture notes and study guides religiously or you will be cooked. | Ignore the bad reviews. Professor Gonet does a great job teaching Calc 1 and her exams are just like what you learn in class and do in recitation. Her lectures are amazing and her notes are very well done. Attend lecture and homework and you'll be fine. I choked on the final which led to my B+, otherwise you should be fine. | her notes were really easy to understand, coming from someone who is really bad at math. she answered emails quickly and was nice about answering questions in class. the notes are all posted online, but i would recommend going to lecture though because she explains a lot more. idk why her ratings are so bad, i thought she was a really good prof | If you HAVE to take pre-calculus, take it with her. - caring towards students - fair grades - always responds to emails - tries her best to help students understand lecture material - easily understood - (if you miss class) always posts lecture notes online If i went to every class, i easily would have got an A. Best Precalc Professor hands down. | Her ratings scared me a bit, but she is actually a really good teacher. Her lectures are pretty easy to follow because she color codes her lecture notes and posts them for her students to look at on their own time. Maybe not before, but atleast now she also goes over problems that appear on the midterm and finals in class. | idk why she got so much hate on here but she's very easy to understand and breaks topics down very well. she's very kind and she is committed to helping us learn. I would definitely recommend her. | Does not care about her students whatsoever, and does not care about students circumstances or Math department policy. She is by far the worst professor at Rutgers. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. You will be better off taking Calc 152 than any class with Prof. Gonet. | She is very helpful if you go to office hours and her lectures help with understanding concepts. There are so many resources for calc 135 and they give all previous exam questions and lecture videos, so your grade reflects how hard you study. | This was my second attempt at calc at Rutgers, and Prof. Gonet was a great help. Her lectures were very clear and I feel like most of my section knew what was going on because of her teaching style. Her notes are displayed and posted on the board, and are well organized for studying | Contrary to what I expected from the reviews before taking her, her classes aren't bad. She takes the time to answer questions and interacts with the students while teaching. She's pretty rude in her emails, though. This goes for not just her, but with Calc 135 in general: if you didn't take calc or ib math in high school, you're going to struggle. | This Professor is not good at all. Avoid if possible. She does not have any sympathy towards students. She also does not answer emails when sent and communication is very poor. Tests over the summer were not as difficult, but she lacked communicating proper information | This is by far one of the hardest professors I've had at Rutgers. If you can, change your professor if you can. She is not understanding of any circumstances you might have and will not cut you any slack. She grades unreasonably and barely gives time to submit the exams. Easy questions in class but exams are hard. HELP | worst professor at rutgers | Unengaging lectures backed by vague notes and unclear grading criteria. | Rude, no sympathy for students, JUST DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. my biggest regret since being at Rutgers. Hands down the worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are very boring and seem robotic. I am now retaking the class with a much better professor who makes the class engaging. | she prepares you only to do well on her own test and quizzes that she writes, but when it comes to the final exam you will be inadequately prepared because she never gave questions in class that are as difficult as what is on the final which is written by the department and not her. Class average on the final was a 50. She's also quite rude. | she doesn't respect her students. just avoid please | Has really organized notes. Office hours are helpful. Show up on time or you'll be lost. | the lectures that she gives are easy to understand but when it comes to exams and quizzes they are harder. She doesn't work with the hard questions with us and expects us to know it. | Rutgers Calc is ridiculously hard and Professor Gonet understands that. I had her the second time I took Calc, and she made it a breeze. She speaks clearly & allows time for questions. I highly suggest going to her office hours and doing the practice exam problems she/Dr. Guadagni gives out, and you'll likely do fine on exams. | She never gave problems that were as hard as the exam, and the notes she uses aren't even hers. Also, all other recitation quizzes are online, but unfortunately, she decided to be the only professor to give them in person. DOOO NOT CHOOSE HER, she may seem nice but nice doesn't give you the grade you want. Pick a professor who actually teaches. | Rutgers calc is something else. Please listen to me and everyone else. If you can take it at community. DO IT. She always taught easy problems during lectures and then your screwed for the midterms and final because it doesn't even relate. ONLY PROF IN 135 WHO GAVE IN PERSON QUIZZES DURING RECITATION. also go to recitation or ur gonna fail lol. | just horrible | She explains things really well. Absolute GOAT. Was retaking Calc and could understand everything perfectly with her teaching. She is a legend. Take her class yall. TBH I never went to office hours once bc I didn't need to but she is truly an icon | I had her for calc 1. She was super nice and and explained things in a way I could actually understand. I'm definitely not a math wiz so for me successful I had to do more than just go to class or read the textbook. She makes understanding the basics possible but its up to you to do harder practice problems on your own that are on the exams | So bad at teaching. She's rly nice and answers questions but I only could learn from my recitation with a different teacher. Her lectures feel sooo long and she messes up problems a lit. A different professor writes the exams so it is so much harder than what we do in class. | Honestly surprised by the lack of ratings this teacher has because she literally is the best. You can tell that she really cares about her students since she always looks forward to people asking questions during class. Her notes are very straight to the point and if you understand the homework you can definitely pass her quizzes as well. | Prof is okay when it comes to teaching the material. She copies her notes on the board so we can copy the notes verbatim. If you memorize her notes you'll do fine in the class with HER quizzes, homeworks, and exams but it does not prepare you for the final (given by the department) or other upper level math. | Professor Gonet was nice. I took her Algebra class and it was pretty straight forward. Since the class is run by the department, there isn't much she can do when it comes to lessening homework, but she makes up for the departments mistakes by being available, helpful, and informative."
"Sequin, Matthew","problems i had about the class had nothing to do with the professor, it's just the way the course is created. he's a sweet professor that's ready to teach you. go to class and be responsive and ask questions. he can teach and is super nice. just take him but he's not teaching business calc next sem | Lectures were good and organized. Sometimes hw assignments would be unclear but there is enough time to complete everything. I had him for Calc 152 and he taught everything very thoroughly and answered questions in lecture. | I took Business Calculus (130), which was new this semester (Fall 2024) and Professor Sequin was one of the best professors I've had so far. He answers all you questions, makes clear and good lecture notes, and explains each concept very well. Always had a good vibe and happy voice, very cool guy. I would recommend taking his class for Math130. | Straight forward and easy to understand lectures. Responds to emails quick and is a fair grader. I would also like to mention that the TA and LA for this course were as good as the professor. | Really nice professor who enjoys the subject. | Tremendous. Took calc last sem, got a F, retook w/ him and got a B. If you know zero calculus, this is the professor for you. Amazing lectures that prepare you for quizzes and exams. Is very forgiving when grading and looked at mid term reports and made alterations accordingly. Attend lectures to do well bc the class is still difficult by nature. | Overall great experience with professor. Lectures were average but he gave really easy quizzes. Easy to reach outside of the class and answered questions succinctly throughout the semester. | I received a C not because of this man, but the way the course was designed. This class is a weed out course and it was even more difficult because I didn't take calc before, but because of him, I still passed. He explains all the problems very clearly and clears up any questions you have. Other calc professors aren't good teachers so take him!!! | I had him for 135 after failing with another professor. I did much better with him. He was always polite and seemed to care about helping students do well. | He goes through lectures pretty slow and easy (good for people who dont have a calc background). However, he does not make the exams and the level of difficulty on the exam is not comparable to lectures. The only way I was able to succeed in Calc was Dr. G's website. Do the worksheets then past exams for the according exam. Lecture wont be enough | Horrible! When you ask what's on the exam he says HE DOESN'T KNOW. If you try reaching out to him he doesn't respond until the end of the semester and says he has too many students to get back to. | The class itself is hard, but I thought he was a good teacher. Clear and concise with his teaching methods, and during review you can ask him as many questions as you want, he'll go over it. I wouldn't depend on him for a good grade though, you are going to have to review and practice on your own. | THIS IS NO AN EASY A CLASS. Math 135 is a difficult course in general and even more difficult if you had no prior knowledge of calc before taking this class. You have to be prepared to study a little bit every day. His teaching isn't all that bad, but practice questions and tests are what got me through this course. | explains things really well! this class is a hard class in general but he explains the concepts in a way that is understandable. only con is that the problems he goes over in lectures are nowhere near as difficult as the problems present on the exams. | Goat | Great professor. | He's a lecturer for the math department so not many things are in his control, he can't give extra credit or curve, but he is a really good lecturer and answers questions well. He gives good advice and honestly if you fail his class it's you not him, the department controls everything if you need help go to him or Dr. G website has a good practice. | Dr. Sequin's a great professor. Has relatively straight-forward lectures that cover most if not all of the material necessary to ""succeed"" in this course. However, you should pinpoint what you don't understand and do a bunch of practice problems til you really know what you're doing, if that makes sense. Hard course, esp w/o prior calculus classes. | Sequin is a gem. 152 was perhaps one of the toughest classes I've taken yet Sequin made it smooth and easy to understand. He replies to emails relatively fast and ensures you understand the topics if you put the effort into it. | The class itself is difficult, especially if you aren't familiar with the concepts. But most of what sucked about it was because of the math department. Sequin was actually a pretty good lecturer and explained things to the best of his ability. Most of what he said in class made sense, but you need to put in the work yourself to really get it. | Sequin was great with explaining problems and answering questions during lecture. However, this class is very hard. A huge percentage of my class failed. You must put PLENTY of effort in outside of class in order to succeed. MyLab is your best friend, use it wisely. Great professor, but you must put a lot of effort in outside class to pass! | Prof. Sequin was very thorough with his lectures and was active in answering all questions that we had. The only thing that didn't fit me was how he taught the foundations, like how to solve problems, before jumping into example problems that are much harder than the concepts. The exams are also very difficult compared to the lectures and quizzes | Class itself isn't mandatory, but recitation is. Good teacher for Calc, especially if it's your first time learning, but he does go a little slow sometimes. He hold weekly office hours and WILL answer your questions there, though his answers are very ambiguous when it comes to departmental questions or things about exams. Def take him for calc 135. | I took math for liberal arts majors with Dr. Sequin. He is great at explaining concepts and teaches at a reasonable pace. He is responsive to questions and helpful if you reach out. The class is easy to pass as long as you watch the lectures and show up to class. I usually don't like math but I enjoyed this class. | Really cares about his students! Problems on his exams are similar to homework problems (doesn't grade those) and examples from lectures. Homework isn't collected, and he doesn't give a lot of it. | He is at Saint Peter's U now. Great prof. he definitely cares about students. Class is hard but he made it as straight forward as it could have been. | He's the best | Mediocre professor... He's definitely overhyped. Do you work, study, and stay awake in class. He's an average lecturer at best. | Exam is very difficult, but curve is fair. | Professor Sequin was a breath of fresh air. Most professors at Rutgers make classes extremely difficult without any good reason, but he made sure to make it simple. Go to class because his class examples are very similar to the test examples. He gives little homework but make sure to do it. One of the fairest teachers. Also, I took his summer class | 2 midterms and a final. collected homework. maple labs. go to his lecture bc he basically teaches everything you need to know. do your homework and youll love yourself when exams come. it isnt too much hw given anyways. exams were like homework problems. gives you a kind of study guide that list ALL possible topics on exam (SomeMayNotBeOnExam) | Sequin had good lectures and cared about students, but exams were too hard. If you care about learning probability you should take him if just care about gettign an A take someone esle | Sequin is a great man. He teaches very well and provides examples that will help you perfectly for homework and exams. Cracks a joke here and there and makes the class enjoyable. | Sequin had good lectures, they were super clear and it was obvious he cared about teaching. Midterms weren't great but not terrible either, the final (common) was easier. Wish I had him for 152 now. | Tests are a little hard but he does a good curve. He is a really helpful teacher and will crack an occasional funny joke to keep a light mood. 477 is a really hard class but he makes it enjoyable and easy enough. | Very clear. Doesn't give tons of homework. His tests range from relatively easy to crazy hard. However, his grading is more than fair. I would highly recommend him. | Prof Sequin is a great lecturer. He speaks super clearly and works through examples in lectures without going too slowly. Genuinely nice guy, there to answer your questions, occasionally makes nerdy jokes during lecture, so its bearable. He does not give much homework at all and exams can be a little tough so make sure you study! great guy and prof | Helpful,clear, professor. Only thing that pisses me off is that i feel that he grades way too harshly. I studied very hard, felt like I knew the concepts exceptionally, and still did o.k on the exams. Other than that, no complaints. | He is a great professor and the material will be easy IF YOU STUDY. Studying is a must, especially since everything that you learn in the beginning of the course does have wide scale implications in the latter portion of the course. ALSO KNOW THE THEORY BEHIND THE WORK YOU DO. That sh-tuff shows up on his exams."
"Gulick, Debra","Uses AI to grade homework, leading to low scores even when answers are correct, and she rarely adjusts grades. Homework impacts your grade more than quizzes or exams. There's a quiz every Wednesday, a cumulative final, and two long homework assignments weekly. She moves fast and isn't great with Canvas. Take her class if you have to, it's tough. | Great professor! Definitely try to show up to every class but if you have one or two emergencies, she totally understands. Attending every class is important so you get enough practice in. Do the homework problems repeatedly because most of the quizzes and test questions are from the homework. Positive teacher. Best math teacher you will succeed. | NUMB & OPS K-8... Exceptional Professor. Invaluable resource for effective pedagogy. Positive attitude. Fostered a healthy learning environment for students that promoted engagement and learning. Approachable, honest, and caring. Key cog in what is a very strong mathematics department at Rutgers. Take her class knowing your in great hands. | Prof Gulick was an amazing professor - she is caring and clear throughout lectures, and sets expectations for quizzes and tests very clearly. There was a quiz pretty much every class but you don't need to study for them unless you're struggling with a topic; they are genuinely, actually little check points. The final will be hard so study for it. | my fav professor so far. very engaging and makes learning fun. if you show up, youll understand all the material. can't express enough how much I loved her class. 2 weekly hw assignments quiz after most classes (usually 1 really easy question) 2 tests and final if you get a part wrong and it messes up the rest of your work, she'll still give credit | Highkey the goat. Cares about her students a lot, and offers help whenever you need it. A good amount of work, two assignments per week and a quiz. The quizzes are extremely easy though as long as you understand the material and she goes over it the day of. It's almost impossible to fail. | she's nice but gives so much homework. the tests are quite painful, not gonna lie. the textbook is on Sakai so u don't have to buy it so thats good. she's a little heartless and not understanding but its alright. overall helpful when you don't understand something. took this class as a hybrid so half online, half in person. | She was my favorite professor. The course is fairly easy and she is so sweet and helpful. She makes everything interesting and is always willing to help you. All the questions on the exams are in order and are all straight forward. She was great, id suggest taking her for anything that she teaches. Textbook is given to you online. | Topics in Math for the Liberal Arts is an easy math class but requires some effort. Professor Gulick is great and knows what she's talking about. She's very helpful and wants you to do well. There is a quiz once a week and an exam about every month but they're easy as long as you understand course material. Take this class! | Professor Gulick is a very caring, involved professor. You can tell that she genuinely cares for her students and whether they are mastering the material or not. She is very clear, posts all of the power points, and has many opportunities for grades. Good class, even better teacher. | Professor Gulick is great. She's a Mom and she acts like it. She's very personable and makes everything in class relatable and useful. She is not boring and you can tell she really cares about not only what she is teaching, but also about her students. She forms connections and makes material easy to understand. I enjoyed the class greatly. | Mrs. Gulick is the most amazing teacher i've had at Rutgers thus far. She's kind, compassionate, and friendly. She really tries to get to know each student and bring out the best in each one. She makes confusing topics really clear and she will continue to teach until the class understands the topic. I wish all teachers were like her. | Professor Gulick is absolutely amazing. I had her last semester and she made the subject (I don't even like Math) very interesting and engaging. She showed us how we can use what we learned in real life situations and made everything very clear. Great professor, energetic, and extremely helpful! Take any class you can get with her if possible! | TA for evening section of Precalc 115. Absolutely the best TA ever!! She's patient and helpful. Seems she was at Middlesex before (or might still be). I am particularly glad I got her this 2nd time around in precalc at Rutgers!"
"Weingart, Michael","i hate math but he was probably the best professor i could ask for to finish my math credits. his grading system is weird, i don't know how to explain it, but it's not based on points and basically just makes it almost impossible to not pass. as long as you're doing the assignments and showing up for class you'll get an a | By far the best teacher at Rutgers University HANDS DOWN. He cares about you passing and wants you to succeed. He understands youre a busy college student and may slip up on a few assignments but never holds them against you. Attendance is mandatory and theres a lot of homework but its manageable. Show you care and youll receive a good grade. | I only had Professor Weingart for a few weeks now and I can tell he's going to be one of my favorite professors at Rutgers and I would so take another math class with him. He teaches material in such an understanding way and has you learn in a way where it is so easy and accessible. He's great at answering and clarifying any questions you have. | So much HW but he is pretty caring overall a great professor just be ready to sit through 1 hr 30 min videos explaining the content. Impossible to fail the class though as long as you do the work. He also gives you plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. | Professor Weingart is an awesome professor, his class was easily my favorite from that semester. He is incredibly funny and entertaining yet knowledgable and as helpful as it gets. He was the one professor whose classes I genuinely wanted to attend. You must take him. | Professor Weingart is so caring! He explains the material in a simple and light-hearted way. If you don't skip class and you do your work, you will be fine. | I love this man. An incredible professor who I was fortunate to take for a difficult class. | This is not a class to take if you don't want a lot of homework. Since it is a hybrid course, there is lots of homework due online every week. But, he provides helpful feedback and is very lenient with the homework grading, so it is not too hard to do well in his class. | The best professor I've ever had in my entire life. Makes math fun, interesting and easy to understand. Always willing to answer questions. I wish he taught every class at the university. Take him take him take him! | Hands down the greatest professor at Rutgers University. He makes learning fun and interesting. ANYONE can take one of his classes, regardless of interest in the subject matter, and get an A--not because it's an easy class, but because he is truly an extraordinary teacher and professor. Take him and take as many classes with him as you can! | THE BEST EVER! Makes the material easy to understand and generates interest in it. You'll actually use this math in real life, too. If you're bad at math, he doesn't make you feel stupid when you get something wrong - instills confidence in you for sure. He's also big on partial credit so show your work! TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!! | AMAZING PROFESSOR, I LOVE HIM. Definitely go to class, it's really not that bad! Topics in Math for Liberal Arts is an easy A with him! Pay attention because the things you learn in there are actually helpful in real life and he makes difficult material so much easier. Definitely take his courses. He is so helpful and such a great man! | BEST PROFESSOR EVER. | This professor is a wonderful man and a great teacher! I was a male student of his this year and I can say he takes a shine to any student who participates and tries their best. The class itself wasn't the easiest thing in the world but I still got a good grade despite slacking off later in the year. No textbook since he provides one on sakai. | I LOVED THIS PROFESSOR! I really enjoyed this course, he was very clear on all the material that was being taught. I highly recommend taking any class being taught by him. if you are looking for an easy a, this is not the course. you need to do the work, but you learn a lot and it is all very interesting, even though it requires a lot of work. | He is an awesome professor! He keeps the class interesting with such a positive attitude and always offers extra help if needed. Definitely take him for Mathematics for Elementary Teaching 107! | really great professor.. really nce to students and always willing to help.. liked what he was teaching so it was easy to learn what he taught.. first two exams were easy, but the final was difficult.. overall still got a good grade in the class | RU's best Professor hands down.Prof.Weingart truly wants his students to learn & succeed. Very funny and is always available for help either in office hours or online.He is challenging but he makes it fun and you will learn. Take him whenever you get the chance. | He's the best professor at RU. I don't really think there's much else to say.. if you put effort into the class, it will be off, and he'll help you every step of the way if you need it. More professors need to be like him. | the best. very responsive to questions and concerns. interesting subject, too. if you have the opportunity, take him! | Dr. Weingart is a fine professor, although I am not an avid math student, his class, Elem. of Combinatorics and Probability (the name should be changed, intimidating), is quite simple if you put in the time. Basic concepts but needs a lot of practice to master. Take Him. | I have nothing but good words to say about this professor. He is beyond helpful and always makes such an effort to help his students. He makes a lot of jokes and keeps class fun and entertaining. Material isn't hard but even the troubling stuff is simple with his teaching methods. I absolutely recommend him. | Professor Weingart is great. He's extremely helpful and genuinely wants you to succeed. He grades homework so you have to make sure you do it right, but his exams aren't hard and he gives extra credit. I'd definitely take him for Math 103. | Weingart is AWESOME! He is a fair grader and always available for extra help! Extremely nice guy, no complaints at all. | i LOVED professor weingart. i am usually very bad at math, but weingart made class fun and interesting, which helped me to better understand the math. the class included 2 midterms, hw, final, and extra credit was offered. i would recommend him if interested in taking tops in lib math or math 104!!! | He is the greatest math teacher I've ever had. Write down everything he puts on the board, because its word for word how to do everything that is on the test. He is so clear and is willing to help at all times. If you feel like blahh about taking a college level math, and think you suck in it, don't worry, this guy is the greatest nicest, etc. | One of the best professors I ever had. I hate math and always do badly but his class was great. He makes the test easy for you and is always there for extra help & assistance. | Great professor. Actually cares about students and wants you to pass the class. Hilarious professor too. | Very thorough while explaining the concepts, while also giving interesting side notes. Very funny guy, keeps everyone amused at all times. Excellent teacher. Highly recommended. | Nice guy, speaks very very clearly so it is easy to get the concepts down. Always was willing to help and sent many homework hints before it was due in class. His tests are not that hard, definitely worth taking with him. | Weingart is definitely my favorite teacher at RU by far. He is so nice and will help anyone at anytime. He really just wants to help his students. Homework is doable and clear, just note taking in class which isn't boring bc he keeps the class laughing, and only 3 exams (1 is the final) that are very straight foaward. I def reccomend this class! | possibly my favorite professor ever at RU so far. he really wants you to learn and it would take real effort NOT to in this class. | He speaks clearly and conscisely, and is patient when you don't understand. He makes math seem somehow bearable, both in his class and his office hours | finally, someone who can teach math clearly and effectively...he somehow makes math fun - take him if you can!!! | Michael Weingart is the best instructor I have ever had, probably in my entire lifetime. That is the only class that I have never missed and I actually enjoyed going to his lecture twice a week. He has a great sense of humor and gives a bunch of help in his office hours while having fun at the same time. If you can take his class, TAKE IT!!!!!!! | Dr. Weingart is the man. He really wants people to do well and makes the most boring subject somewhat interesting--more than anyone else. Makes asking him for help very comfortable. Take any class with him. He knows what he's doing teaching. | Had him for Linear Algebra. He has a ""math teachers"" sence of humor. But really cares about student learning. | weingart is the best professor ever, so helpful soooo funnny, amazing. makes you want to learn about tangent slopes and integrals | GREAT teacher! He actually made calc fun for me and I really don't like math. He makes jokes and uses pictures to explain his problems so the concepts really stick. He also remembers EVERYONE's name and face (even if you never talk). I'm so glad I had him. He really made my semester. | He is a GREAT teacher. Best teacher I have ever had at Rutgers. Take him if you can, he will make you LOOOOVE calculus, I swear. He is really helpful and nice. He explains the material so well it make calc easy | awesome teacher, if he wasnt my teacher for calc II, considering my schedule, the subject, and my general sleeping schedule, i wouldnt be awake through even 1 class of calc II Easiness 5 -> hes not easy, but using this as a modifier for how hard the teacher makes the class with poor teaching, he does the opposite, making the class easier. | One of the best teachers that has taught Calc. Very funny while teaching you the material. DEFINETLY take him if you are taking Calc. | Amazing teacher, take him if you can get him. He loves teaching and it shows, and he's really great at getting people to understand the material. | Absolutely amazing teacher, the best teacher that I have ever had, EVER. He explains things so well, is very patient, and he is always available to help students. He somehow managed to make Calculus not only easy, but fun and entertaining. He is funny and sweet and smart and just a GREAT TEACHER! | Smart professors are easy to find, but Purrrfect professors are rare. Weingart is a rare find!! He is without a doubt, the best teacher I've met and seeing the other comments I think everyone else is agree with me. If you need to take Math, take his class. If you don't, take it for fun, because you will in his class. | By far the best teacher at Rutgers. From now on, i rate my teachers on a scale of 1 to Michael Weingart. | I have to agree with everyone else, he is the absolute best teacher at rutgers. Had him as a TA and he taught me more in a 50 min recitation than I learned in two 80 min lectures a week with the actual professor(Feehan). HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! | Michael is the BEST teacher at RU, I've taken three classes with him and loved every one! all math teachers should be like him!!! | Best teacher I've had at rutgers. | The Greatest Teacher I Ever Had At Rutgers. | He is fantastic.Probably, the best TA at Rutgers. I can't stop loving him | The best teacher I've had at rutgers. He could teach a five year old multi-variable calc and they'd be able to understand it. He's always available for extra help which is good because the subject material is pretty damn hard. | He is the man. The most helpful T/A I have ever had. I hate Math but he made class fun with jokes. His teaching was perfect and his quizzes were fair."
"Martorano, Paul","She was a nice teacher, who tried to help in any way she could, hard to understand at times but overall i passed this class with a C, and I have no idea how i passed the exams bc they were a bit tricky, but at the end a 60 is a C and homework is 10% so u only need to average a little over a 50% on the exams to pass the class as long as you do the h | Announced at least 1 lecture ahead of time if there would be a quiz. Quizzes were easy. Exams were tricky. The textbook was more helpful than lectures. Do yourself a favor by doing lots of practice problems. | Paul is extremely nice. Her only downside is its sometimes tough to understand her. Reading the book definitely helped me. There is also a huge curve at the end of the class. She tries her best to give people a good grade. Definitely take her | really easy, really nice. her accent is a little tricky. going to class helps a lot because her notes are what is on the exams. 3 exams and quizes in between. all pretty easy. reading the chapters and doing the homework helps. she wants you to do well. easily got an A, didn't study for the final | She is pretty easy. A little confusing at times but if you read the book it helps. Go to class because what she teaches in class is what is on the exams. If I could take her again I would. Shes nice and really wants to help her students learn. | she is a very nice person and tries to help a lot, but instead she ends up confusing you because of her accent. it is an easy A if you know how to study on your own. her tests and quizzes are easy and she also allows you to talk during the quizzes. Also, she messes up a lot in class. | Had for intermediate micro. Allowed to talk to other people for help during quizzes, exams not difficult. | I used to actually like econ. She's managed to suck the joy out of just about all of it. One of the most ineffective professor's I've ever had in my four years here. AVOID HER CLASS. | There is good and bad with prof Paul. She is an easy grader that curves. Exams and quizzes are not hard as long as you GO TO CLASS, do the hw, and take notes. This is def a plus. The bad: Hard to understand (she has an accent, so I don't fault her for that), TERRIBLE handwriting, does a very poor job at answering student's questions, + boring. | Horrible, horrible lectures. Can't understand a thing she's saying. You ask her a question, and she'll just make you even more confused. Exam questions are fair, but you have to teach yourself pretty much everything. READ THE TEXTBOOK. | If you want to sleep and not understand a thing in class take her, if not; choose otherwise."
"Farro, Scott","He's pretty good, tends to laugh a lot, and lectures can sometimes get dry. The exams are based off concepts covered in class and in the homework. Beware: the homework takes FOREVER! I would consider myself pretty smart, but there were many sleepless nights in an attempt to finish a problemset. | Cramer is a great teacher! His lectures are great and he has many office hours. His exams are also fair! The homework is not required, but DO THEM and also do them ON TIME. He is very nice and approachable. So, there should be no excuse for not getting an A. | Please do yourself a favor and take him. He's very funny, approachable and easy to understand. Even though sometimes he may not be clear, asking him to reiterate during lecture is enough to have him explain concepts clearly. His exams are very fair, review sheets provided and all. Just be sure to focus on concepts too. Fair curve too. I'll miss him | Professor Cramer is funny and easy to approach. He truly loves math and you can tell by how he teaches. The exams are challenging and there's homework every week but that's math! | Do what you need to do and he will surprise you with a better grades. | knows his stuff, pretty clear in class if you take notes, but doesn't really know how to explain himself. if you do the homework and put in a little extra studying you will get a B+ if not an A in this class. exams are easy and straight-forward. | nice | I took the 477 before. Although the average is around 40 out of 100 but he will give big curve. No one will get F in his class. And all of the problem came from the lecture notes with some change. Only those who never attend the class complain the tough problems. I got A in the 477. | Very nice and helpful!"
"Kennedy, Joanne","One of the worst math professors I have ever had. Does not teach, just works through problems without explaining what she is doing or why. Can not hear if you ask a question, also does not answer questions without attitude. Lots of homework, takes attendance every class, super unhelpful. | Terrible professor, she's too quiet to the point where you can't hear her. Her lectures are hard to understand but attendance is mandatory. She is a tough grader and doesn't curve. DO NOT TAKE HER YOU WILL FAIL!!! | Writing this two weeks in. So far, homework is easy as long as you study. Quizzes can be a little challenging. Teacher cannot lecture at all, she is very quiet and sounds like she has dementia. She is really nice though, but cannot teach at all. I would say you have a better chance passing by teaching yourself rather than learning along with her. | She does not teach a single thing and you will sit in class so confused about what is going on. Most of the time she just solves the problem from her answer sheet. She does not explain any steps what so ever. You will have to study like CRAZY on your own if you want to pass this class. She also talks so low so sit in the front. Please save yourself | This is my first time writing a review and I just want to say if she is your recitation teacher, It would be best if you switch sections. Its unbearable trying to get through recitation mainly bc she cannot answer your questions. She has a difficult time explaining on anything you're confused about, not helpful!!! will never take her again"
"Kerrigan, John","I had Professor Kerrigan for PreCalc, Calc 4, and now have him for Pedagogy of Peer Led Learning. His classes are interesting and relevant and he is always willing to help with questions or needs. Highly recommend his classes to anyone | I think all the reviews say everything about him. During lectures, he'll go around the classroom, asking if anyone has any questions on the material, so do ask. Also, attend his office hours, especially the special final review zoom session. Very funny guy (like me), sad to hear that I couldn't have him for Calc I. | Easily the best professor I had my first semester here by far. Take him! | Professor Kerrigan is by far the best professor I've had at Rutgers so far. He really make sure you understand the material and helps you prepare so well for the exams. I cannot stress enough how good of a professor he is!! | We loved Johnny! He made a late class not so bad!!!! | Dr. Kerrigan is definitely one of the best Math Professors. He makes the lectures very active, making sure you are able to understand and do the problems. He also clearly states what you want to do and is willing to answer questions constantly. His humor and ability to make the class enjoyable was outstanding. | Very helpful with the lectures and when I ask questions | Professor Kerrigan was my Precalc professor Fall 2024.He was very professional in his classes and prepared us well for all exams.He is cool to talk to in office hours or during class too.I liked the layout of this class a lot. | Prof. Kerrigan makes math engaging and approachable. With his helpful examples and practice exams, I aced the class. The free textbook and Unstuck study were also super useful for study prep. | I took Differential Equations in Spring 2024 previously and actually learned it better this time around over the summer with Dr. Kerrigan. There is as lot of work, but the exams and quizzes can only be described as very fair in comparison. The classroom itself was also nice | I took this course in the 2024 Summer Session. Professor was very communicative with the class and was timely in responding and giving feedback, and let us do re-do and re-take of assessments. | Professor Kerrigan, made my spring semester. He's very fair and patient and made math a little fun for once! | Amazing professor who really makes sure you understand the lesson with as many examples he can give. I think half the reason I got an A this sem was bc of the practice exams. I studied them front to back, and found the real exams were VERY similar so I knew the topics. Go to recitation, Dr. Vasquez is also very good at explaining topics. | Awesome professor, prompt with help and replies, clear grading criteria and made Stats simpler to understand. | He's so sweet, balancing rigor and humor well while teaching a challenging class. Made my freshman first semester a positive one and wish I Could take for Calculus 1. | Best professor I've had at Rutgers to date. | great teacher. very fair with grading and passionate about what he does. also very funny and wish i could have him again | literally the best professor at rutgers. he is a great teacher and very fair grader. i like him so much I'm a learning assistant for his class now. 10/10 would recommend | GOAT professor for Calc IV, wish I could have him now for Calc V | Very fair and patient professor. Quiz every class and Matlabs only count 5% | He is a good teacher, that has very good communication skills with his students. He teaches through flipped classroom, play games, and really does take up the board space to further explain his teachings. At the end of every class he will give students a paper to fill out about what you have learned. He is also a funny teacher. | Amazing professor. He deserves all the praise in the world. I wish I could take him for every math class. | He is of the best professors at Rutgers and probably throughout the country. | The final exam was so easy thanks to all the resources Dr. Kerrigan provided. I would recommend him to anyone any day | Dr. Kerrigan is one of the best professors Rutgers has to offer. His overall preparedness for the class is what makes it enjoyable. The flipped classroom really helps with learning styles and it's different from most if not all other classes. Take this professor for any math class he is teaching you will not regret it!! He also has good jokes! | I failed this class in fall 2022 and ended up understanding it with Dr. Kerrigan spring 2023. He is easy to understand and relates well to students | While his flipped classroom style is not for everyone, I really enjoyed it and I believe if you just put in the effort to actually watch the (usually short and easy) lecture videos and attended his class, you will easily succeed. His exams are very fair. He is very open to feedback and looks to make his class the best learning experience possible. | He's a great professor! Assignments are adaptive to the student, and he answers email promptly. | One of my favorite math professors/teachers, ever. Professor Kerrigan is miles ahead of other professors in the math department at Rutgers. He is transparent with what will be on the quizzes and exams, and tries his best to help you understand the material. Would definitely recommend his classes. | He is a very good professor, personal funny, and doesn't overcomplicate the material. | kerrigan is an amazing professor. he made learning math fun for me. every lecture is really helpful but you have to put in the effort yourself. he makes it clear what will be on upcoming quizzes and tests, and makes learning the subject really fun and interesting. he is prob my favorite professor in my first semester of college. | My fave professor for fall 2022. Always come to class positive even though it was so late and encouraging and made efforts to know the students. Clear teachings as well. 10/10 recommend | Professor Kerrigan is such a sweet guy, and he genuinely loves to teach, his lectures are easy to follow and the coursework is helpful. I would love to take him again! He's also pretty funny lol | He's so sweet and prepared us very well for the final exam. Can't recommend Dr. Kerrigan enough. | John is a great teacher. He loves what he does, and he helps people realize the joy and importance of math in the world. 5/5 rating is what I would give him. The University is lucky to have him. I now want to succeed in mathematics and possibly pursue a minor in it. | Understandings, accomodating professor who clearly explains the material. Truly cares about his students. | Dr. Kerrigan was absolutely phenomenal. He presented challenging material in an easy to understand way and encouraged intellectual growth by allowing students to work through the problems instead of spoon feeding answers. His flipped classroom instruction style was really good for keeping the online class format engaging. | I was taking professor Kerrigan's math 152 this summer, he is responsive and always cares about his students. This was an online course and also a flipped classroom, you need to learn a lot by yourself prior to the class, but he will also explain the concepts thoroughly. It is a pleasure having professor Kerrigan as my 152 lecturer. | I'm taking Professor Kerrigan for CALC152 over the summer. He is by far one of the best math lecturers I've ever had and he really cares about his students and their performance. Very fair professor. Would recommend and take him again. | I got an A on my first exam after failing this spring all because of professor Kerrigan. He really breaks down the material into ways that are understandable and is generous with his time and attention to students outside class meetings. | Possibly the best professor I have ever had. He is vey good with the structure of the lessons. In addition, he has a contagious personality that makes me excited for class. | Possibly one of the most amazing, fair, and understanding professors I have ever had. He always answers emails very quickly and will help you understand topics by posting supplemental videos. I also appreciate his love for math which he share with us. | If you're taking Linear Algebra, you HAVE to take it with Professor Kerrigan. This is my second attempt at taking Linear Algebra, and not only did I end up with a good grade, but I actually understood the material this time. The format of the course is great, and he is very responsive and grades very fairly | Extremely fair and responsive professor! He made linear algebra really interesting and accessible. | I had the opportunity to be his grader for a semester and he was great! Super prompt email responses and always there to help! Thanks Dr. Kerrigan!! | I had the professor Kerrigan for the Math 250 linear Algebra class in the fall 2021 semester. Well organized class and fair grading. The professor Kerrigan responded to all questions quickly and thoroughly. I would like to take the professor Kerrigan again. | He made the information that we were given easier to learn and he would do quizlet lives and kahoots to make sure that we understood the material and to give us a challenge but still make it fun. | Excellent professor | Great teacher and great guy. Midterms were easy and he gives plenty of review and warning of what will be on it before hand. Prepare for the weekly quizzes though, as those you get a lot less guidance on and you have to learn the material yourself, but its still not too bad | Very funny professor, helpful to students, and always upbeat n friendly | A really nice, and funny professor who is passionate about teaching his subject and is always on the side of the students. Show up for his lectures, do the work, and you'll be okay. It's a really hard class, though, so don't expect an easy A. | His class has been a good learning experience. Gives good hints in study groups about priority topics. 5/5 | Funniest professor I've had yet | I Had professor kerrigan for math 115 and this summer math 250 with no regrets. Sign up for any classes with him, he is a very fair and fun professor. | Great professor!!! I like him a lot!!! He is my favorite STAT professor. He fairly curve the class. The material is hard, but his lecture is good. The test is fair. Highly recommended!!! | Love him, he's so funny | I took Psychometric Theory with Dr. Kerrigan Spring 2021. Despite a lot of statistics, the course was very interesting and relevant as a future school disabilities consultant. You can resubmit assignments for a higher grade. | Kerrigan really cares about his students and there's a reason he's one of the mostly highly rated profs at RU. He is super happy to help and I always found him very helpful in office hours. I didn't love the flipped method he uses for teaching where you watch the lectures before class but it worked and he was great regardless. | he cares SO much. He'll be there for you 110%. He made calculus fun and I looked forward to his class every week. I highly recommend him | Only difficult if you don't read the book. Professor Kerrigan was a good professor who gave many resources and opportunities to do well in the course. Exams were open everything, points for watching videos, and extra credit opportunities. Would take again for calc. | He's honestly the best mathematics professor I've ever had. He always responds to emails fast and goes out of his way to provide enough quality material for students to learn from. I wouldn't want to take anybody else for math. I recommend him 100% | Dr. Kerrigan will probably be the best professor I will ever have at college. He is the nicest, funniest, most accommodating professor I have had by far. Everyone loves him, and for good reason. His exam reviews are very helpful and similar to the tests. He really turned math from my least favorite subject to my absolute strength. Incredible man. | Best online course I took this semester. Professor is respectful of our time and feedback and is willing to meet outside of class time in the evenings or on weekends. | The ACTUAL GREATEST OF ALL TIME! In my entire time as a CS major at Rutgers this prof is 1 of the ONLY 2 profs I LOVEDD! SO understanding, explains well, cares about student grades, fair exams, give extra credit to make up for any problems on his part, & always trying make the MOST of class! Lin Alg was great even though I hate math ONLY BC OF HIM! | John is such a good, caring and understanding Professor. His teachings are clear and he is a great mathematician. It is always a pleasure to know that other students love and admire his teachings. Highly recommend his classes for ease and clarity. | Very educated instructor who cares a lot about his students. He was always quick with a response on questions and had a unique and effective way of teaching that I really enjoyed. | Best class I had this semester. There is a lot of reading and the weekly activities are interesting. This class has solidified my interest in becoming a teacher. | Professor was very engaging and wanted you to succeed. Had some great laughs but also learned a lot. | He's a great professor. He really cares and keeps the class engaged. He understands that our time is equally important to his, and works hard to teach the most efficient way. I took a ""flipped learning"" class which I thought was going to be horrible, but not at all. You will end up doing online webassign during most of the lectures. He's great | John is hands down the best professor I had at Rutgers. He definitely keeps you entertained with his jokes, but he is also so helpful, and really knows what he is talking about!! TAKE HIM"
"Mehta, Nishali","I found that this professor really helped me understand the material much quicker. Lectures were very organized and the homework directly correlated with what you learned in class. If you pay attention and understand the material, mid terms are easy. The final was a bit tough, but overall good professor. | She is nice and explains everything clearly. Very careful and patient with students. She always gives great examples with vague concepts. This course contains 7 quizzes (the lowest two will be dropped), 2 midterms, 10 homework and 1 final. | She is kind but the quizzes and hw were super easy and the exams are much harder. | Unlike other linear algebra professors, Mehta does not use cheat sheets on exams. Heavily conceptual on exam content. If you are not already familiar with linear algebra I would try to find a different professor. Not a lenient grader. | She grades everything herself and partial credit DOES NOT EXIST. If you don't get something 100% right and show every little number/step how you got there- 0. Exams so much harder than class/recitation, our class average~ 50s; tutors in the help center couldn't even solve my exam probs. No help outside of class- zoom office hours which doesn't help | Professor is very good at her job and helps students whenever they need help. I highly recommend taking calc 1 with her. | Although Professor Mehta isnt the one creating the test she was a really good professor. The Test were really hard though | grade relied way too much on 4 big exams and not enough on homework and quizzes. Other than that, not horrible, decent - average for a calc class, was a lot of content, but relatively understandable and doable, definitely have to put in some work tho. | She is a good professor, but the class is extremely hard. If you have taken Calc. in the past you will do great, but if you have never taken calculus, you are gonna need to put in a lot of effort to keep up with the class. But this professor doesn't give you any extra credit questions on homework, or quizzes whereas some other professors do. | She's a good calc teacher. If you are good at math you should take her without hesitance. Exams are crazy hard though(not her fault), so I ended up dropping the class. But she's not really at fault for that-- the math department is trippin and lmfao math is hard | One thing is for sure: I am definitely not going to pass this class this semester. I don't really think it is all professor Mehta's fault. It is mostly because when I took this class when it was half online and half in person which was a huge problem. Professor Mehta is an average professor. The biggest problem was the course in general. | I had her for calc 1 online, quizzes and hws every Thursday! 4 exam and final, shes generous and shes willing to help out! | Professor Mehta is one of the best professor you can get for Calc 135. She really wants you to understand the material, but the course is just difficult overall. The curve goes crazy at the end. As long as you study and ry your best you should be okay to pass with at least a C. Take Mehta is 135 is a requirement. | Professor Mehta was a godsend. She is a really good lecturer and tries to make sure that you understand the material. The assignments she creates are also relatively easy (i.e. quizzes and hw). The hardest thing are the midterms which the coordinator creates, so that is not on her. Great Prof! | dude calc at rutgers might suck but professor mehta is genuinely extremely helpful & understanding. i love her. | The prof herself was amazing. I recommend her office hours FOR SURE!! That is what brought me from an F to a B. The coordinator was tough and to me, rude. He had a constant attitude. The coordinator is the one who makes the exams but the prof makes the quizzes. I feel like we did limited exam-level practice problems, so I recommend the textbook. | As the previous rating said, Mehta was not a bad professor but the course coordinator was the one making tests so I relied on his material to study. I used Mehta's notes to get a general understanding of the concepts. That being said, I honestly wouldn't recommend taking calc online, it was super chaotic and unorganized. | While she is a good teacher, she doesnt make the exams. I really found myself dedicating a lot of time to study outside of class from YT vids and the textbook. I had to watch the Dr Gs videos because she would often not know what was on the exam because Dr G made them. I dont recommend taking her online if youre trying to get an A. | Her lectures are very detailed and she answers all questions asked. During office hours she is very accommodating and goes over lots of problems. I personally don't think that the math department handled the switch to online well, compared to others. The midterms are really difficult because they are more intense than the problems in class. | If you want an easy grade but do not care if you learn nothing, take Professor Mehta. She does not answer any tough questions and only goes over the easier questions. | Probably the best math professor out there, especially through the transition online due to covid. Took this over the summer. It was super fast-paced, but she made it easy to do well. Definitely a tough class, but she makes sure we understand everything, so ask questions! Only complaint: doesn't curve much, thought I was going to get an A. | I thought she was very nice but her lectures left more to be desired. Especially when the class went online and exams came from the department, I felt under-prepared. Either way, she remained kind and accessible. Grading seemed very inconsistent at times. I felt I deserved a better grade in the end, but I could have done more too. Overall 2.5/5. | Taking a math summer class with her and was having a very difficult time. Even though she is a nice lady, she is a harsh grader and you could never predict what's gonna be there on the exam. There is no practice exam. Definitely avoid upper-level math courses with her. | Awesome professor and lecturer. For a tough subject of multivariable calculus she really lessened the challenge upon us. Her in-class examples and explanations of concepts were great and make you want to go to lecture to not miss any! Highly recommend for any math class. | PRofessor Mehta is a diamond in the rough. Brilliant lady with exceptional teaching skills. | Her lectures were amazing to listen to, and I learned a great deal of Multivar Calc because of the way she presented it. The homework is easy and reflects the first two midterms. Recitations were fun, and the quizzes were easy. Watch out for the final and study hard for it because that was the hardest part of the course. Everything else was great! | She is making the class too easy and as a result people struggle in further classes. Like when I took Math 152 after having her for Math 151 (for which I got an A btw) I felt like I wasn't prepared for the level at all. My major problems were with graphs and answering theoretical questions that I needed to know from Math 151. | Really nice, easy grader. For calc 135, I recommend actually doing the suggested textbook problems before each quiz and exam, as the questions are very similar. I also suggest retrying the online homework until you get a 90+ on each assignment. I went to every lecture and found her helpful. Try to get her if you're taking calc 135!!! | Took her for math 135. It was her first time teaching 135. She is really a great professor and her midterms are easier than other professors so its essentially a grade booster because the final is so hard and unfair. She cares about her students and she does great examples during lecture and you'll see it on her midterms. Take her for math 135! | Love love love loved this professor she is a superior teacher. | Terrible experience with this prof. in calc 1. She doe snot cover all the material, changes exam dates at the last minute. The midterm review way different than the examples she covers in class. If you want to learn anything, find any other professor. | BEST PROFESSOR EVER!! Her tests are very straightforward and fair and she prepared well for the final exam. Office hours can be helpful as she is super approachable and accessible. Would definitely take her for any class! | This class is a gold mine, one of the the absolute best professors to take for calc 3. No bloated amounts of busy work, extremely helpful and accessible, and will go to lengths to help you learn the material. Exams are fair with no tricks, and reward those who learn the material being tested. Strongly recommend for this class. | She is a good choice for calc 3 (professors make their own final after calc2); her exams are very straight forward. All you need to do is study her examples. The only problem with her exams is that since they're not that difficult there is barely any curve. I felt that this class would have been more difficult had I taken it with another professor. | Definitely take Mehta for 151. Yes her midterms are easier than the department final, but that doesn't mean she won't prepare you. Her midterms help boost your grade and during lecture she goes over ever type of problem you might see on the final. If you have any questions she is very accessible during office hours and goes over problems with you. | Her mid-terms are easier than the actual final but it helps your grade at the end of the day. Just be mindful that the final is easier. Compared to other 151 teachers, she assigns way less webassign. Her teaching skills are great and cover mainly everything important in the textbook and points out what harder stuff may be in the finals. TAKE HER | Dr. Mehta is an incredible professor. She answers all questions or concerns you have. She dedicates her entire being to our success. She is extremely punctual and teaches for the entirety of the class-time. Never used the textbook because she prepares us very well for exams by giving us relevant examples during lecture. I highly recommend her! | Total smokeshow :) she made math 477 a great experience for me. Really helped me understand probability and the advanced concepts needed for the actuarial exam. | Didnt teach all material we were supposed to cover. Midterms were easy but she didnt prepare us well for the final. | really bad professor ! She is so strict with grading and still so bad so bad............... | The first exam average was 50. The second exam was straightforward and everyone did okay. So she made the final exam EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Her review materials are ambiguous and are just problem types and lists of suggested textbook problems. There's no way you can predict what type of problems are going to be on the exam. No way. | The best math professor in the department. Had her for Calc 135 and for Mathematical Theory of Probability and I actually enjoyed class because of her. She's always clear and concise about the material, the exams are a little difficult but she writes them herself so if you go to class then you're set. | beautiful professor very good would recommend. Her lectures were rather amazing and I have to say she is one the best professors I have ever had. I would definitely take a course with her again. | You don't need read the book. Her examples are almost exactly the problems she put on exams. So easy. Failed the class in the fall, got an A with her in the summer. So much easier. Choose her. She probably not the best lecturer. but make sure you copy down everything she puts on the board. | Fantastic professor. Very clear during lecture and the exams are extremely fair. If you attend every lecture and take notes as she puts them on the board you will do well in this course. Unlike other math profs she is very accessible and also explains complicated concepts clearly. Highly recommend. | I falied calc 3 previously from a horrendous professor. Retook it with Professor Nishali, and she it absolutely fantastic. Make sure to go to every lectures as her examples are relevant to the exams. One of the best professors I've had. | The professor is always very well prepared for the class and always willing to help outside of the classroom. Early riser so she will view emails early in the day as well. | Professor Mehta is a great professor - very clear, accessible and intelligent. Lectures were helpful and there are 10 HW assignments (20% total), two midterms (20% each), and one final (40%). HW was helpful for studying but she also provides review problems for each exam that are useful. Tests have very few surprises, but THERE IS NO CURVE. | Her class is mostly based on lectures; if you go to the lecture and understand the material from there, you are going to do really well on all of the exams. She is usually available whenever you need her. | Teaches at a very slow pace compared to other instructors that I've had. Midterm are extremely easy and grading is lenient. She doesn't go into depth though. She only writes the formulas on the board without proving them or giving some intuitive explanation, and then does easy examples based on these formulas. Also extremely boring. | I had her for both calc 151 and calc 251 and she's def my fave math professor. She explains everything clearly and gives very fair exams. Love her!! Def take any of your math classes with her if you can. | VERY GOOD | VERY EASY. EXAMS ARE EASY BUT SHE DOESNT PREPARE YOU WELL FOR THE FINAL WITH HER EASY EXAM. EXAM IS WRITTEN BY THE COURSE COORDINATOR. | Professor Mehta is a great Calc teacher. She goes through the material and gives example son the board. She is willing to answer questions and do more problems if you ask her to. Her test are not very difficult but you will have to study for them. She will give partial credit . I would definetely take her again if I had to take another calc class | Nishali is an amazing professor who gave the best lectures. She was very well prepared for class and she explained everything very well. She also gave some of the easiest exams for Calc 2 (Math 152). I would definitely take this professor again, as she is my favorite professor off all time. | Great professor. Very organized, clear, patient, everything you need to get through a proof-based math class. She gave 5 simple quizzes throughout the semester (which helped a lot), and hw every week. If you put in the effort and know all the definitions inside out, the midterms will be more than fair. Reading the book sometimes helped, sometimes n | Her midterms are easy compared to the final made by the dept. Easy to get a B but just a few people get As because As are determined by number of A's students on final. | She is super clear with the class material and she is willing to help during office hours. The course is hard, because we have to learn a lot of things within a single semester. Her exams are decent, so if you work hard, you will receive a decent score as well. | Super easy midterms. Only assigns about 15 WebAssign problems per week. Definitely recommend going to lecture because she explains everything clearly. | Great professor! teaches at a much slower rate then other professors, and her grading is good. teaches by the book and is straight forward. test are pretty easy and not to complicated. | Professor Mehta was a great professor. She was very organized in her lectures. Her midterms were significantly easier compared to what was expected on the final, which did hurt many of our grades. However, she taught the material very very well and she encouraged us to come to her office hours for extra help. Highly recommended. | Grading system is whack. no curve and her midterms are way to easy compared to the final. Easy B or B+ not an easy A because As are determined by number of A's students on final and since she doesnt teach toward the final there are very few As. If you want an A, dont go to lecture and just read the book. its more clear and prepares you better. | I had her for a summer calc 3 class. She was crystal clear with everything she taught, and she taught us all the material on time (unlike a lot of profs). Her tests were straight forward, directly from the learned material. More professors should be like her. | Professor Mehta takes a generally very difficult class for Math majors and does the best job I have ever seen making the material clear and relate-able. She makes participation a must and this helps you a lot. Study hard and take good notes and you can do well. Lectures are really well planned and executed. | I took 251 with her over the summer. Professor Mehta explained every topic concisely, and although it was from the book at times, if you can follow her examples and suggested problems from the book, you can do decently in the class. Definitely a fair grader. It is Calc 3, so don't expect a cakewalk, but she's there to help you. | Neutral professor. She teaches Calc by textbook definitions(quickly) so most of the concepts can be difficult to understand during lecture. Do the homework and go to recitation for clarification on anything you don't understand. I took calc twice and I would recommend her. She's unbiased, fair grader, and doesn't count attendance like my others do. | Professor Mehta is an outstanding instructor. She teaches so well that she puts some of the tenured math faculty to shame, and that's no understatement. She does move a little fast, but she explains things so clearly and effectively that it doesn't really matter. She's very responsive to questions and she grades quite fairly. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN! | she was a very good 311 teacher, I heard this class was terrible but she made it interesting. | Mehta knows calc but shes not good at teaching it. I had to take this class for a business req. so Im not a math person. She taught the entire time and at a very fast pace. She writes on the board the whole time, her back to the class the whole 80 minutes. Either you listen to her or write what's on the board, you can't do both. | Mrs. Mehta is a great professor, she is an excellent example of how some people are born to teach. She gives great examples in class, and is a fair grader. Her exams are SUPER difficult, she teaches well but she expects you to soak the material like if you were a sponge"
"Liu, Liping","Worst prof I've had yet. His teaching style is confusing & without exaggerating, did not learn anything. I was solely relying on what I learned in HS, and if I hadn't taken AP calc in HS, I would've def failed this course. He is also very condescending, expecting students to automatically know ""advanced engineering"" for a normal calc course. | worst teacher I have ever had in all of my 18 years of life. I had to learn the course material on kahn academy due to his inability to teach. This professor struggles to teach you how to do the problems and only seems to focus on why they work. This conceptual teaching method does not apply to the class. If you have this professor switch out. | Don't understand him. He doesn't answer questions. Easily the worst professor I've ever had. | Do the samples and easy A. Homework is important. Lectures are horrible. | Great course and different from the usual plug-and-play... make you think | This is so far the most difficult course I took. The professor did not just teach, but made me to think. Strongly against memorizing formula. I have learned a lot. | Exams are not horribly horrific however his teaching is not clear at all. He is very bad at explaining problems and he doesn't even complete problems. His homeworks require paid online access and don't relate to the material at all. He promotes dropping the class to raise the average. | he is horrible at grading. he pretty much encourages people to drop and he won't fail you he will give you a D. | The previous reviewers are really misleading. I found he was extremely helpful. | nice guy and nice professor. he is very helpful. but his explanation is not clear. | He knows his material very well. However he is not too good at explaining it. You never know what the answer is because he is all over the board. Nice guy tho and I do feel like he wants us to learn. | Really bad professor, he doesn't know how to teach, several mistakes doing problems"
"Bowles, Malcolm","came with his own stack of printed notes of both guides and practice problems you had to fill out. really helped you understand the ""why"" behind a lot of the work. lectures are a little slow, but he really tries to help you understand the material | absolute cinema best calc prof | The best professor I've ever met. Perfect and clear lectures. Notes he prepared in learning resources hold everything you need. If you feel confused about anything, just take his office hours. Trust me, choose his sections without any hesitating. | 158 is the practicum for 152, 3 quizzes. I wouldn't take it if you stress over final grade. All quiz questions taken from the workshops you do in class. Not worth taking in my opinion, just put the extra time you'd spend in here just studying and you'll be better off. Bowles as a professor was fine, it's just the course itself isn't worth taking. | First C I've ever gotten but the fact I'm still giving a 4.0 rating shows how good Bowles is. The only reason it isn't a 5 is because sometimes he does explain reasoning behind things in a little too much depth even if the reasoning is irrelevant, but his notes are amazing and he provides 1 page section guides for midterm/final prep. Elite guides. | Amazing professor! Best professor I've had so far at Rutgers. Professor Bowles is able to explain difficult and complicated topics in an understandable manner. If you come to lecture and pay attention, it shouldn't be hard to get an A in this class. Take him! | The best professor I've ever had and probably the best prof at Rutgers. I owe him my degree after getting me through 152, as well as 151 and 123 before that. | Made an extremely difficult course into a digestible one. Took him previously for MATH123 and immediately took him for 151. Wouldn't have wanted to do Rutgers math without him. GOAT | Nice, young and hot. STOP scrolling, just TAKE HIM. It is your fault for not getting an A out of him. I am going to take his cal 2 for next sememster too. Thank me at your end of the semster. | Overall professor Bowles is great! I had him for calc 1 and 2 and his lectures were genuinely extremely helpful. Outside of class he was very easy to email and contact. I loved having him as a professor even though I struggled with calc 1 and 2 he helped me a lot. | If he is an option for any calc class, take it. He is genuinely the best professor i have had in the 3 years i have been here. His lectures were clear, and extremely organized. I went to his office hours all the time when i didn't understand problems on the homework and he was super helpful. I definitely would recommend taking his class. | His lecture notes were amazing(he posted them after each lecture too), his office hours were so beneficial, and he printed out example sheets each lecture for the whole class, which I now wish I had in Calc III lol. I tell anyone taking Calc II in future to get him as a prof, b/c it is still a hard class but he makes it very clear and concise. | Calculus II was not easy, but I would not have done well if I didn't have Professor Bowles. Very patient, gave practice exams almost identical to midterms, and prepared us well for the final. However, do not expect a curve as most students tend to excel in his sections. Nonetheless, I would like to take higher level Math classes with him again. | Bowles is really kind and is always willing to help. His lectures were bearable and he posts them on canvas, but not always right away. He can answer any question in an understandable way, so he is a good resource as you prepare for exams. Actual exams were usually harder than the practice exams, but he posts a lot of resources! Highly recommend | exams r exactly like the review, so an A is doable. very nice, tries to make the material understandable, his TAs suck tho. | Incredibly kind and caring teacher that is extremely good at articulating his words in lecture. He is very good at explaining different concepts and I had him for calc 1 and 2. His lectures made me understand the material very well. I made this account just to give this review on him. Thank you Professor Bowles | CalcII is easy but I still learned a lot in this class. His office hour is very useful, and he's willing to accept and discuss new ideas. One of the best professors I've had. | The GOAT, wouldn't have gotten through Calc 2 without Professor Bowles. His lectures are extremely well done and he makes sure every student understands the concepts. Do the homework and attend lecture and you will automatically be fine in this class. Rutgers makes Calc 2 hard, but Professor Bowles is an excellent professor. | Very nice and approachable professor. The lectures are very good, and the notes he uploads are great. Probably one of the best math teachers I've ever had, and one of the best professors at Rutgers. | Truly a magnificent professor. Calc 2 was by no means easy, but that is true regardless of the teacher. Bottom line is, Professor Bowles did everything to help the students learn: great at explaining concepts, offered Zoom session reviews and office hours, and very approachable, patient, and nice -- greatest math prof I've ever met. | Most excellent math professor I've met at Rutgers. 80% of course grades come from Midterms/finals, so it's easy to succeed as you prepare for the tests. | Best professor for calculus imo. Had him sp 2023. Helpful office hrs & answers any questions you have. Responds to emails quickly & lectures are clear. Notes are always posted on Canvas. Grading took a while so I didn't know I had a B until after the 3rd midterm which was tougher than the first 2. Practice exams were really similar to actual exams. | The best math teacher I have ever had. Amazing at articulating the concepts of Calc 1. Super approachable, patient, and always willing to help outside of class. He offers two Zoom office hours per week. If you're taking Calc 1, Professor Bowles is amazing. | Great professor enjoyed the class | Just took the final and I felt like I had to say how good of a professor/person he was. The lectures made so much sense, he's so patient, even when people asked irrelevent questions, and was super approachable. I never felt intimidated to ask anything and he is just so kind and almost calming(?) Like I never felt anxious or panicky in his class. | I am currently having him for Fall 2023. He's the GOAT for Calc I. Explains all concepts properly and never skips any material. Take him if you think your Calc I basics might be weak. Office hours are also good. He is ready to help and easily approachable. | 100% the best calculus professor I ever took. Exams are just like the past exams he posts (Past exams are shown on canvas with solutions), and homework was so helpful and very well spoken in lectures. | Mr. Bowles is the best math professor ever. I met him at Math 123 2022 fall cause i struggled so much with my 151 and i degraded to 123 to catch up. His patience to students is truly remarkable. And he speaks very clearly and so understandably. I never felt math could be so easy before. | I took him for 151 and 152 and he is a great professor. His explains the concepts well in lectures and clears doubts patiently. Follows a clear grading process. I never used my textbook for the course as his notes and homework were enough to prepare for midterm and finals. I enjoyed my courses with him and I recommend you guys to take him as well. | I took him for 151 and 152, and he is a great professor. Explains concepts well in lecture and clears doubts patiently. Very clear grading process. I never used my textbook for this course as his notes and homework's were enough to prepare for the midterm and finals. I enjoyed doing 151 and 152 with him and I recommend you guys to take him as well | nice dude, take him if u can, only reason why I passed calc II | Malcolm Bowles is a 10/10 professor. Maybe because the class size was small, but he was very caring and invested in all his students. He helped further my understanding of the pre-calc topics that I needed help on. The only complaint I would have are his LAs who were sophomores and juniors and kinda lacked the ability to properly help. | Professor Bowles was always ready to teach and help us understand the material that prepared us for the final exam. 10/10 recommend | Malcolm is by far the best professor I've ever had at Rutgers. His lectures are very concise and clear. He has 3 office hours periods per week which makes him very accessible. I highly recommend going to his office hours because he helped me overcome any concept I struggled with. Take Malcolm for Calc 1 and Calc 2 and you will be fine. | His lectures are very well organized and easy to follow. He genuinely wants students to succeed and helps out as much as possible. He also holds many office hours especially before exams which makes it easier to ask questions. My favorite professor at Rutgers so far. | When I took Bowles for Calc 151 in Fall 2022, I loved his class. He conducts well-organized lectures that are easy to follow. He was also easily accessible for office hours to clear up any confusions. I recommend taking his class as he makes the notoriously hard class easier for the student. He is also very nice and wants his students to succeed. | Amazing lectures and easy to understand. Very supportive and clears whatever questions we have. Would recommend him to others and I am taking him again for calc 152. | Other professors need to teach like him. | Very organized lectures, helpful in office hours, and wants to see you succeed. The course itself is hard but due to his availability in office hours and answering questions after class, he made it manageable. | He is a very nice professor who answers every question that students may have during lectures. I did have my doubts about him in the beginning of the course, but that is only because the course itself is difficult. He is a bit quiet, but he goes through the steps in detail in every problem. | Had this professor for 640:421 during the spring of 2022 and he is really a great guy. Standard lectures that you would see anywhere in the math department. Easy test, you just have to pay attention in class. Would take again!"
"Vera, Laurent","Professor Vera is very knowledgeable, patient, and organized. As a student who previously unfavorably viewed math classes, his amazing teaching style made me excited and interested again in the subject. I'd really recommend his class; he's great! (Also, his TA is wonderful too.) | Really good teacher! The course module is clear. TA is great too! The notes outline will be sent in advance and the professor's own complete notes will be available for preview and review. There will also be video lessons and mock questions before the exam, which will be more difficult than the exam | Easiest class I took in my first semester here at Rutgers because of this man. His notes are flawless and straight forward, all his review sheets help you prepare yourself for the exams and I am so happy I had the chance to experience having him as a professor. Def recommend him for anyone taking this class! 1000/10 Professor! | Vera is easily one of the most helpful professors I've ever had. Extremely kind and intelligent and always willing to give feedback and help with any mistakes you might make on a quiz or exam. Definitely take calc 2 with him. | Great Professor! While the tests were really strictly graded, he was just following the rubric. He helps you understand what you did wrong and is accessible after class! He responds to emails fairly quickly and hand-writing is clear during lectures! Underrated professor, might be the best out here. | Good Professor. Pre-class lecture videos, lecture notes, workshop, and quiz results all posted online to review material. Review sessions before exams. Home works are time consuming. Overall, good class. | Genuinely helps his students study for exams, gives more than enough resources to prepare for tests, also gives lengthy review sessions. | I had him for Calc 2, and he is easily the greatest math Professor I've had in my life. He is extremely knowledgeable and shows multiple ways to approach problems when possible. He is also patient and thorough with both his explanations and his feedback. | Polite, patient, knowledgeable, and lowkey cute. The best professor I've ever had. TAKE HIM. | Had for Precalc 111 (pt.1) - amazing professor. He built a solid foundation for me to work upon by correcting common mistakes and by breaking down difficult problems into easy to understand parts. Very thorough in the lectures. Tests and quizzes were very fair. Neat handwriting and speaks clearly. | Professor Vera is the best possible professor for Calculus II at Rutgers. He is incredibly helpful and provides more than enough resources to succeed in this course. Great professor! | Professor Vera explains every topic clearly and really well. The class is incredibly difficult and you will struggle, especially on the homework assignments which are irrelevant to the exam material. | Prof Vera is a relatively easy professor and is very nice. He does a flipped classroom and helps us with all of our assignments before we submit them so that it is an easy 100%. As long as you go to class and watch the videos you will do good. | These class was great, it was a flipped classroom. Which you watch lecture at home and then do work in class,Prof.Vera just does little review and then helps you with the assignment. But overall, was a great class, Vera is very helpful and explains everything clearly. Absolutely recommend!!! Small quizzes every class and 2 midterms and a final! | The best math teacher I've had, he has very clear notes and took the care to rewrite all of his notes to make them easier to write down and learn in lectures. Homework and recitation assignments were lengthy, but if you go to his lectures and actively absorb the information you should have no problems. absolute goat | Top math professor you can get. Highly organized, shares notes online, provides optional extra practice for skill improvement, offers pre-lecture videos introducing topics, and has detailed notes outlines for better focus in class, super fair exams as well. Truly the best professor I've experienced in college. Took him for calculus 2, got a A. | The best professor forever. His lecture is amazing and organized. | Fantastic professor. He posts all his notes online and his exams are very fair and he is always available to answer emails or offer help. Calc 2 has a really bad reputation especially at rutgers but Prof Vera makes the topics very easy to understand and overall is one of the best math professors | As a freshman, Professor Vera was an incredible teacher. His lectures were well organized, he was very neat and had a great balance between notes and examples. He is very kind when people ask questions, and makes sure everyone understands before moving on. I would highly recommend taking him if you are hesitant about calculus. | One of the best professors I've had. Calc was a really hard course and I was hesitant if I would pass the class, but Professor Vera gives great lectures, so I recommend you go. He is very helpful when you come to his office hours to ask any questions. I would take his class again if I could. | Amazing professor! He uploads great notes and has very clear lectures. He is seriously one of the best calc professors out there. | Makes calc so easy to understand and truly cares about his students. take him if you want a good professor. by far one of my favorite college professors | Exceptional lecturer. Professor Vera took his time with every lecture to assure everyone understood the concepts. No matter how easy or ridiculous the question would seem, Professor Vera would still take his time to explain it. Calc isn't an easy course but if you pay attention to lectures and do sufficient practice you'll be perfectly fine. | Vera really is an amazing professor. He always makes sure you understand the material before he moves on to the next topic. He does have a little accent, but that didn't bother me at all because I understood everything he said. The only downside is, each week he gives us hw that would take me FORVER because the hw would have things we didn't learn. | This man is a godsend. I failed this class once already and took him this time and did amazing. Very accessible and kind. Holds review sessions out of genuine care for his students. Explains questions from all different angles and clarifies down to the detail. The combo of Dr. G's resources and Prof Vera's lectures will be your key to success. | Calc at this school as a whole is made for you to fail so you're going to struggle with any professor. Im terrible at math and this class was very difficult but I genuinely do not think I would have passed if Laurent Vera was not my professor. He holds review sessions before exams and is quick to answer emails and wants you to be successful. | It was a hard class but that's just because calc is a hard class. the way he taught it made it much easier and better explained than anyone could. he taught it well and simply, he is easy to talk to and will assist you if need be on an issue | Taking Professor Vera's class will definitely prepare you for the exams. He is very helpful in helping you to understand the material as he will clarify any questions that you have during lectures and in office hours. | He is a great lecturer. He explains things in a very straightforward and concise way and always asks us if we have any questions about anything. Great professor, highly recommend. | calc 135 is standardized (hw and quizzes vary between professors), so it doesn't really matter what prof you have but if you have the chance TAKE HIM. Never took calc in high school but still managed an A, with high passes for each midterm! Professors like this guy make college worth it | I love Vera. Take this man. I took calculus in highschool so I know calc, but I would still love this teacher regardless because he is super approachable and friendly, yet informative and effective at lecturing. He is my favorite professor so far. The material can be difficult at times so practice the previous exams. TAKE HIM! | He is a very chill professor, he will make sure that you understand the material if you reach out to him. Sometimes his lectures are hard to understand if you dont know calculus so make sure you have some friends in class. This class is miserable but not because of him, he is very patient and will explain a topic as many times as necessary. | Vera is one of the best lecturers I've had. I don't think there's ever been a question that he couldn't answer and explain perfectly in class. He definitely knows what he's doing, and he can teach it well. Obviously the class is hard and requires a lot of heavy lifting, but it doesn't hurt to have him as a prof. He's also p chill in general. | Laurent is a great prof. Only being a month into the course, he really does show that he cares. He holds review sessions for midterms and really goes in depth during lecture and always asks us if we have any questions before moving on to the next concept. Great guy. Show up to lecture to do well on exams, he really wants to help his students | Prof. Vera's lectures are absolutely amazing. He will clarify as many times as needed until you understand. Try to answer his questions to the class; you'll learn a lot from asking about what you don't understand. | Amazing professor! The lectures were so clear and well put together. All questions were answered thoroughly via email, during office hours, or during class. The homework was not bad at all because all the concepts had already been covered during class. The grading criteria was clear and I would definitely recommend taking this class with him! | Vera was a great professor. He taught the concepts of linear algebra very well. His lectures were organized and his notes were useful. However, the homeworks, at times, got very tough and the quizzes, at times, were difficult as well. But he is very helpful both in lecture and during office hours. He is also easy to reach out to via Email. | Great Professor. Unlike other professors, Vera taught very well and explained each topic. Even if you didn't attend the lectures, his notes online were super clear. Tests and quizzes weren't hard or easy, just in between. Highly recommend attending his office hours so you can ask any questions and better understand the topics. | Tough grader for exams. Failed every single one of them. But lectures are very organized. I think I'm just bad at Calc 152. Have to retake over the summer. | Professor Vera does a great job ,he explained all the steps, really care all the students can follow the class. And he gave us the lectures notes for all the topics, I never saw a math note so organized like his. I am not good at math, finally I pass calc2. | Perfect all-around professor. Amazing lectures, always loved attending them. He posts his lecture notes that are very neat and precise, you can study from them for your exams. Pre/post quizzes, homework, and workshops are very good for preparing you for the exams. Personally, I enjoyed them. Wish I could write more on how good of a professor he is. | I took Professor Vera's math151 in the fall and 152 in spring. After a whole year of calc with him, I can say that Vera is the best-organized professor I have ever had in my life The lectures were delivered in such an efficient, concise, compendious manner it is actually unbelievable. Vera is the goat. In all seriousnessDef my fav professor now | Vera made Calc 2, a class that is quite difficult because of its loosely related, complex concepts, all the more easier. He genuinely cares and will do his best to answer your questions, and his best is THE best. He has a deep understanding of math and can even prove concepts to make them easier to grasp. The exams are challenging but doable. | Professor Vera is one of the most thorough and organized professors I've had the pleasure of learning from. It felt like he was always prepared to answer any kind of question, long as it pertains to calculus. His tests are a little bit harder than what I've seen from other Calc professors, but at the same time, Professor Vera prepares you for them. | Vera really knows what he's doing. I felt confident being taught by someone with so much expertise. Calc at Rutgers is tough, but the professor doesn't create the exams. You should do your homework and recitation quizzes, as those combined are a big chunk of the grade. Vera is the best to take!! | Vera was a great professor, the only reason I am rating it this difficult, because any math class at Rutgers is very hard if you do not know it well. If you struggle in math calc 135 will be hard. He is probably the best calc professor, very clear on everything. He actually cares and will help if you ask. | Great professor! He's very knowledgeable and intelligent. If you are like me and not adept at math, this class will be difficult with little/no prior knowledge of calculus. You would have to put extra effort into learning the material throughout the semester in order to succeed. However, his lectures are very clear which makes the class tolerable. | Professor Vera is really nice however the exams can be tough sometimes. Do all the homework in order to receive credit as well. Concepts are taught vaguely. However, if he sees that you are hardworking he will make sure you pass the class. Calculus is a hard concept to grasp on so go to extra help. | It was hard to progress in his class because he only taught us limited basic concepts that have never appeared in our exams. On top of that, we got an overload of assignments that certainly did not came with sufficient time to be completed. The ones who progressed in his class certainly came with an abundance of knowledge obtained from high school. | Prof Vera definitely knows his stuff and is a great calc teacher. He's very clear and always thoroughly explains lectures. Out of the other calc teachers at Rutgers, he's definitely one of the best. | Class is way too hard and youre just expected to have a good understanding of calc already. But thats not really his fault. For the class, hes probably as good as its gonna get. Take calc at community college and save yourself the stress. | Too many assignments too little time. If you havent taken Calculus in high school, youre in for a difficult time as the lectures assume you already know Calculus."
"Lepowsky, James","Worst teacher ever. Never got to learn anything. Now principal at Saint Peter's Prep and doesn't do anything. I hear people there don't like him either. | really easy, very rarely did the required readings and could still participate. Won't learn anything new, but if you go to class you'll probably get an A | St. Peter's high scholl teach. Great guy | He was my highschool teacher. | No Comments"
"Vasquez, Jennifer","Had her and Professor Kerrigan for Math 115 and it went nothing short of smooth. Nice lady and great teacher. Would recommend her to anyone. | Had to retake calc 151 and she made the most difficult topics easy! She gave us note templates and I felt extremely prepared for the exams. She hosted office hours and was willingly to answer questions and go over math problems anytime I was confused. Wish she was teaching at Rutgers full time, a great professor!"
"Sun, Hao","Professor Sun is very nice. He is super patient with all kinds of students and accessible outside the class. His lectures are quite clear and organized. A fortune for our school. | His accent is hard to understand and he wants us to self study from book which is hard, i basically had to self study from prof leonard on yt which i recommend if you have never taken calc 1. Also I have miderm/final sheet if anyone wants selling them for $30 if you take yuhan sun. Dm me on discord Asia | yuhan sun for calc 1 is difficult. His accent is hard to understand and he wants us to self study from book which is hard, i basically had to self study from prof leonard on yt which i recommend if you have never taken calc 1. Also I have miderm/final sheet if anyone wants selling them for $30 if you take yuhan sun. Dm me on discord Asia | I want all students to note this. This professor is by far the worst math professor I have had. Never in my history of taking math all these years have I ever received below an A, yet this professor I received an F. I won't deny that I procrastinate as well, however the professor itself will not get you an A unless you have previously taken calc 1. | extremely test heavy, but the tests are absolutely nothing like what he teaches. please do yourself a favor and dont take him as your prof | The worst math professor ever. I took him for Calculus math/phys and his tests are nothing like what he goes over in class. It is unfair that he's allowed to screw students who are stuck with him. | Very kind and helpful. Always responsive to email, is eager to help. Subject is difficult. Exams are similar to homeworks, practice textbook problems to prepare. Exams are open note. Take him! His notes and lectures are clear and organized. Pay attention in class, he explains things well. | Very good professor. The class is very organized and the notes are very clear, This is a very difficult lesson, but because the professor has become not very hard. Good professor!!!"
"Scheffer, Vladimir","I had Dr. Scheffer in-person for Calc1 and Calc2 my freshman year. He is extremely thorough in his lectures and proves everything. If you like really enjoy math, you will love this course. He might be my favorite professor throughout my time at Rutgers. Note: I advise against taking him online. | This class is hard; you're gonna need to study regardless. Honestly, the study guides posted before the exams have a lot of questions that are basically the same on the exam with different numbers, so just use that. He's a really nice professor and cares about his students! He doesn't mind questions! Just be prepared to study good luck :,) | Very bad at explaining. Everyone in the class knew not to view the lectures, as they were just pages of straight text, not even math. He's a nice guy and seems caring but he doesn't answer questions very well, telling one student to be quiet when they were asking a question. I had to self-teach and learn from the TA in workshop. | professor did not assign any homework for the first week, which is the deadline for add/drop. The homework for the second week directly made me write 8 pages full of paper by hand, and each week 4 pages at least. he told us that the homework had nothing to do with the exam in the review class, just to show us some more question types. | I took Calc 151 and dropped it after I got a 20% on the first midterm and 33% on the second midterm. I did not go to any lectures because they consist of slides full of words and I cannot learn math like that. TAs are very helpful however the work that is done in workshop is proofs. Its busy work and serves no purpose in preparing you for exams. | This course NEEDS the exams, so study. Scheffer may seem tough, but it's more just the course over anything. Really easy to get perfect grades on homework and assignments. He does give a decent amount of work, but it's good practice. Great guy, tries to make lectures fun, but they're still a bit boring. Very accessible and responds fast. | he embedded breaks into his lecture slides bc he knew we were all burnt out from quarantine. i think that in itself shows how much he cares. he talks pretty slow and in a very monotone voice, but he is so kind and likes to make jokes to lighten the mood. the course itself is hard, obvi, but he makes it manageable! vv approachable for questions too! | He is a really nice person but he can't teach. His powerpoints are full of a ton of words and he just reads through them instead of explaining how to do the problems. I had to watch another professor's lectures to end with an A in his class. | He's extremely intelligent, but his lectures are pretty boring. He gets off topic a lot but he will answer your questions well. Use Professor Leonard on youtube and do the review sheets and you'll do fine. | I had to take the class online. He was difficult. His slides would just be filled with words and letters and numbers and I never had any idea what was going on. I didn't learn a single thing from his lectures. Read the book, understand the examples, and DO THE HOMEWORK and you should be okay. Exams were so hard because the class was online. | If you've already taken calc in highschool, then 151 with Scheffer is pretty simple. Exams can be tricky but he puts out review material and has office hours about twice a week. He's also very responsive when you send him emails, so I would recommend taking advantage of that if you have any questions. You can understand him through his accent well. | This man is the most fair grader, I have ever had in my academic career. Arguably lenient at times. His lectures seem dry but he covers the content on exams. Do the review sheets they will save you. He spends a great deal of time to ensure the success of his students. Not too many prac problems in lecture but the review sheet should carry you. | The dude makes Calc 2 easy, what more can you ask. | Professor Scheffer is one of the best math professors I have ever encountered. I don't know if it's just Rutgers, but he really made me understand math. Writing proofs during workshop and going over difficult logic problems made me get a rush whenever I solved something I've never seen before. Do the webassign and study lecture and you'll be fine. | You have to try to fully understand the Webassign homework and do additional practice problems to do well in 152. Scheffer is a kind professor who loves answering questions and goes slowly and carefully though problems. He speaks a little quietly and sometimes goes off on tangents about math history , but his exams are straightforward. He's good! | His tests are straightforward and not too difficult as long as you study the course material. There are no curveballs thrown. Make sure to do hw and workshops because they are a huge help to your final grade! Overall, he is a good professor and is very helpful! | He's really nice and pretty clear on what he's teaching. Doing the homework and workshops really help your grade. And although his lectures are long, going to them does help since his exams can have problems from the examples done in class and overall his notes are really helpful for the exams. | He was my freshmen year calc I professor. His classes are very easy, you just gotta put some effort into it. Although, lectures are very boring and often will make you fall sleep, because of his voice tone, its a really easy going class. Attendance does not really matter, unless you want to learn something . Definitely take him again. | He's There For You! | Superb Professor. Take him if you want an A in Calc 151 or 152. You won't get bored in class and will hear a lot of history of math. Excellent professor. I hope I could have it for further more math classes at Rutgers. He is extremly knowledgeable... | I've never taken a calculus class in my life and had to take engineering calculus but I didn't struggle nearly as much as I could have. Scheffer can be boring and move at a quicker pace but he proves everything and makes everything clear. Also examples in class can be more advanced than homework and exams so they come easier to you. | Compared to other Calc professors, Scheffer is very straight to the point and he makes a lot of sense. And as far as his tests go, if you do the homework and study the notes, you'll honestly be fine. He's kinda boring, but going to lecture is worth it. Plus, he occasionally makes one of his ""algebra is the way of life"" jokes to add entertainment. | He is really nice! He is helpful and he explains questions in a very clear and understandable way. Just attend his class and do his homework, and then it will be easy to get an A. | Average teacher. just go to class and you will do well. Easy class. | Relatively good professor. His lectures are boring but he's a nice guy to ask questions. Exams were actually not that hard. If you take review the problems and examples you will do well on the exams. He curves according to the department, but it was a generous curve. | Fantastic professor. He taught the material very well and his exams were straight-forward. Make sure you attend his lectures and do the homework. Lectures are a bit boring, but they are extremely helpful. | I will say ""THE BEST"", but go to class, take notes and do homework. If not, don't complain, you are screwed because it is CALCULUS II guys!everything can come up out of the blue. | I think that professor Scheffer may be one of the best teachers I've ever had for any subject. He explains things with the utmost clarity and most importantly he shows all steps in problems. I hate it when professors skip crucial steps and expect you to know what they did. Wish that he taught some engineering courses he would be great. | Scheffer is a nice guy and a generous grader. Unfortunately, the classroom environment is very dull. I found myself doing better in the course once I stopped going to class (probably after 3 weeks). If you can self teach and do not wish to rely on the professor, take him. He follows the textbook. I self-taught and received an A in the class. | Scheffer won't give you the most elaborate notes. Maybe a few times he will give you something that will be extremely useful on the exams. I HIGHLY suggest going to every class, using YouTube for extra help and reading the text on your own will help a lot. Learn the concepts and you will do well. Also, I would go to the TA's office hours. | Mumbles and is difficult to stay awake in class | Incredibly good teacher! Explains everything with the utmost clarity, which is especially required for a course in proofs like Math Reasoning. If you aren't getting something, you will after you ask Professor Scheffer about it. | Vlad is THE professor to have for calc 2 152. His notes are so clear, and he's funny. he even adds a little math history to his notes. Loved him. The course isn't that easy, but if you attend every lecture, take notes, do the HW, and study, you can get an A. | MATH 152 which is the harder version of calc 2 is a challenge. It requires alot of work to do well and there is quite a bit of work involved through hw and workshops. Scheffer though is great, hes very clear and stops to answer questions. Though the class is humdrum at times, you must go, as his examples he did in class will be on the exam, study! | He gives extremely thorough notes, which will really prepare you for exams. He makes jokes during class to keep people interested. If you don't have a strong grasp of calc1, I don't suggest taking him unless you're ready for a challenge. If you don't understand something, he will explain it clearly. Not easy, but if you try, you will do fine. | Best Calculus II professor ever! His notes are very straightforward. If ANYONE has a question, he will pause to explain with examples. He also makes jokes and over exaggerations for clairity. Interesting non-manitory history is thrown in too. I got a C+ because I did NO homework or workshops. Do them! | He is the best calc professor I've had--he is clear in lectures and makes material a little easier to understand. BUT the course material is still HARD. i worked my ass off to get a C. GO TO CLASS, his notes are golden. Examples WILL appear on exams. with the right amount of dedication and hard work you can pass the hardest calc course at rutgers. | Hes the best calc 2 lecturer.ppl who complain about him just fail b/c they dont do the work and thats not his fault.hes AMAZING.study his notes well and do all the HW and u shud be fine.hes really helpful as well.attend lectures and follow what he does.also he has an interesting older generation sense of humor i liked.hes the BEST calc professor! | Really good calc prof! Calc classes usually suck at Rutgers because the professors don't check hw, but he has weekly hw which really helps. Most people who didn't do well didn't do the hw. He's also a really good lecturer and will help you understand anything you don't follow. He's somewhat funny too :) | Probably THE easiest calc professor I have had. I had him for Calc 151 and I got and A, yea you have to work for it but it was much easier than what my other friends went through. He also made my final for Calc 152, which boosted my finalgrade up to a B. I highly recommend him, but you also have to put in time to study and learn stuff on your own. | I had Vlad ""The Man"" Sheffer for calc 2 and he was the best math professor i have ever had. His exams are fair, easier then other calc 2 professors, and a good representation of the what the final will be like. Easy to follow in lecture. His accent and mannerisms are hilarious. Over all he is a THE MAN. | Professor Scheffer is probably the best professor anyone can take for 300. He is crystal clear and unintentionally hilarious. Sometimes he will go too fast but if you tell him to repeat it, he'll gladly do it (and slower this time). | AMAZING. super funny and very easy, but a little boring. | One of the better Calc 2 teachers. A little boring but notes in class will help with homework. | Notes were clear, so copy verbatim. Not helpful in office hours. Gave two free problems for final and 2nd exam. Final had workshop problems. Exam Qs were proving class theorems and writing definitions. Probably best to take for 311 other than Butler. Gaughan text was bad-use Bartle or Lay. | Very tough to pay attention to, had trouble learning from him. | He's awesome. Extremely easy to follow, pretty generous grader, he made the hardest calculus class seem like a walk in the park. I would love to take another class with him. | In my opinion, the best professor I could have possibly asked for, for Advanced Calculus. I don't know about lower level math classes, but for this one he was great. | He's EXTREMELY boring, you'll need like 5 cups of coffee to survive his dull lectures, HOWEVER, if you can pay attention, he's pretty clear and to the point. He is also a decent grader and the exams are fair (very few tricks). | Amazing professor. I failed Calc 2 the first time I took it and Scheffer made the class seem so easy. I've been getting B+'s and A's on his exams and, beyond that, I feel like I understand the material. It's still not exactly my favorite class, but if you have to take it Scheffer is excellent. | He is approachable and very helpful. And no he is not Milton from Office Space. | He is generally a good professor in that he teachs the material well (I for one also enjoy that he puts in a bit of mathematical history while doing the problems). One thing however, is that I do not feel he is the most approachable and I actually ended up learning more from the TA then I did from him. For Calc 2 though he is your best bet. | Considering this is Calc 152 (THE WORST CALCULUS), he was pretty good. Not that hard. I don't even know what a rational function is. | this guy is Milton from office space...wat a ****ing joke this class was | Might be good for advanced math classes plus for an intro to calc class hes sucks..goes way too fast for students who are taking calc for the first time..doesnt realize 99.9% of his students are not math majors and dont understand what the hell he is saying..dont take him if this is your first time seeing calc.. | I had Scheffer for Math Reasoning. He was an awesome teacher and really prepared you for Math 311. I'm in 311 now and am doing great in the class thanks to this man. His curves are great and if you do bad at the beginning it doesn't really matter. He grades on weather or not he thinks you understand the material. | All the ratings are horrible for him, but i have him for math 300 and he's awesome. He's very precise and clear, goes pretty slow and gives plenty of examples and ideas on how to write proofs, definitely doesn't mind answering Qs. He's also really funny even if sometimes he doesn't realize it. | From what I've heard he is horrible at teaching Calc I, but he is amazing at teaching Math 300. He teaches Math 311 and fails many people becasue they are not prepared so now he is teaching 300 so that we are prepared. He knows his stuff and can teach it very well. | If you didn't take Calculus I in HS, forget about taking this class. He's a boring and unclear lecturer and his exams are pretty hard. I took Calculus I (non-AP) in HS and managed a B. | As a person who took Calculus before (and got a 4 on the BC test) I thought Calculus was an easy class. It was an easy A for me. However, he's ridiculously boring and hard to understand. He probably would be better in small groups but is horrible as a lecturer. Personally, I never went to class. | One of the worst professors i've ever had. He was extremely unclear. You will most likely fail if you have not taken calc before. If you have, he will probably confuse you to the point of either failing, or wanting to kill yourself | the new face for clear eyes tear drops....soft monotone voice...great to fall asleep to...friendly,yes...but i still got a D in his class | He's a good teacher, just a little hard to understand. If u do the webwork and the homework problems u should have no problems w/ the course because the exam questions are straight from the review sheet. | I had him twice: awful for calc 2, great for calc 5. He's much better in a small class than a lecture hall. | One of the worst teachers. If i hadn't taken Calc before, I would have failed. He's very unclear, has a very thick accent, and speaks very low. Test are very hard. | THis guy said he had Laryngytis for the whole god damn semester....theres no way i understood wut he was sayin.....n e ways..go to class and sign in for attendance....ur most likely to fail his exams...but u'll get a C+ for just attending.. | This guy sucks, if you haven't taken calculus before, you'll most likely fail. | if u took calc already...he shouldn't be that bad...but he is very boring"
"Frizzell, Carrie","Professor Frizzell is one of the best math professors Ive had. Her lectures are very organized and she explains things well. She is also specific on what kind of problems are on the test. Finally, she is very kind. Calculus 2 is not an easy subject, but shes a great professor for it. | Frizzell is a solid professor. She is very organized and presents very good notes to help you study for exams. She uploads her notes to Canvas which I find really helpful if I missed something in class. The material itself can be difficult sometimes but she's a very good professor. | Frizzell was a great lecturer and the guided notes she posted on canvas made note taking so much easier. The way you do the HW will determine your success in the course. She was always supportive/encouraging when I didn't understand the material. I heard she's leaving Rutgers, but I'm sure she'll be just as great a prof wherever she goes. | Super nice personality. Very flexible with handing in HW late and taking make-up exams. Lectures are easy to understand. Exams and quizzes are pretty easy and her grading is lenient. HWs take several hours each to complete. Class averages were very high with no curve needed. High-level math, but has the heart/empathy of an elementary school teacher | Honestly, I recommend you should take Frizzell for into to math reasoning cause she tells you what to study and her practice problems decently prepares you for her exams. Make sure to go to her office hours if you don't understand anything. The material is a bit hard but I think Frizzel was fair with grading. | She's very kind and caring. Her office hours is your ticket that made me succeed in Calculus I. I struggled so much throughout the semester, but she helped me so much throughout. Highly recommend having her as your professor. | Really understanding and empathetic to student struggles. Definitely take advantage of her office hours, as she is very good at one-on-one teaching. Expect to study most of Calc II on your own; she just makes the learning experience a little more bearable. | Extremely kind and caring-- great personality; not a great lecturer. Her teaching style is more conceptual than hands-on or practice problem related. This flounders when it comes to exam applications. Furthermore, her lectures are alinear and almost disorganized. I would reccommend another professor, or relying on more comprehensive resources. | As a student who was very unconfident in math going into the first week, Professor Frizzell made Calculus 2 enjoyable and understandable. I would always go to her office hours for help on homework or workshops, where she would patiently and thoroughly answer my questions, no matter how dumb they were. I HIGHLY recommend her. | Professor Frizzell teaches in a way that is easy to understand and she is very patient with students. The Rutgers math department is tough and you need a Professor that will prepare you for the final. Professor Frizzell does this in the smoothest, easiest way possible. She is very understanding and kind and overall just a great professor. | Awesome teacher, gives clear and concise lectures and provides lots of resources. | Ms. Frizzell's lectures were very easy to follow, and they're posted for convenience for students who are not able to attend class. Her exams are pretty straightforward and her grading is clear and fair. She's accessible outside of class and you can see the effort and passion she puts into teaching the class and trying to help students learn. | Super passionate about what she teaches. Very easy to follow in lecture. | You can tell she cares a lot about math and she tries to make it very understandable. Even though she's somewhat of a new professor, I think she does great and as long as you do your review and ask questions whether in class, in office hours, or email, you'll get your answer and you'll do well. Very understanding and accessible. | Frizzell is one of the GOATs. Extremely approachable and always encourages questions. Lectures are well-paced and are generally thorough enough to fare well on homework and recitation problems; practice exams were very helpful too. Do the homework, recitation, and practice exam problems, email/go to office hours with questions, and you will pass. | Organized, engaging, and helpful. She gave excellent and helpful lectures where she explained concepts and gave useful example problems. She constantly made efforts to help students outside of lecture time. 10/10 would recommend... just be ready to work (Calc 1 isn't easy). | Frizzell is super friendly; she tries to answer all questions. But she gave no review material for the first exam, and her second exam was very hard. I understand this is a challenging class, but her lectures were disorganized, and her example problems did not help. | Did not prepare students properly for the ridiculous final. Avoid avoid avoid !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Prof. Frizzell was organized the entire semester and consistently gave good lectures even though there were very few places where she didn't know what she was doing. This is likely the hardest math course at Rutgers but she made it manageable. Do all the homework, recitation work, and STUDY for the exams. GET READY TO GRIND AFTER 10.8 | I had her for Calc 152. She posted all of her lectures on canvas which helped a lot! She might not be the best at explaining (she is average) but she is extremely understanding and caring. If you do what she says (her suggested problems) and pay attention to the class you should be fine! Calc 2 is a hard class but she makes it easier. | Probably the best professor I've had. She's excellent at explaining difficult concepts. Definitely recommend taking her classes. | I had her for Calc251 and then for DiffEqs 244. The Calc3 hws were long but in DiffEqs, there were recommended hw problems which she didn't grade but were helpful. Her lectures were long and boring but she definitely knows at lot about the material. She does try to invoke interest by using matlab to help understand the material better. | Frizzell is a really nice person and she is really passionate about math and... geometry, however she cannot teach. She makes every concept more complicated then it should be for precalc and makes it confusing to understand. Dropped out to save my GPA. I also just suck as math in general though. There are also weekly quizzes in res. | Love Prof Frizzell, she always tries her best to stay after class for questions about lectures and have extra time for review. She explains concepts really well and is always available to reach out to if you're struggling in the class. | I made it through this class without opening the textbook a single time. Professor Frizzell's lectures were always thorough and if you take good notes, you'll have learned the topic by the end of the class period. There is a lot of content in the class though, so be ready for the final exam or it'll sneak up on you. | The final exam for this course was a nightmare. So many students failed after the final. Avoid at all costs. | I have taken Calc 151 as well as Linear Algebra with Professor Frizzell. I struggle learning math but Professor Frizzell is able to explain even the toughest concepts in a way that is easily understood. Not only is she a talented professor, but she is also extremely approachable and understanding. | Very good lectures. Always responds to students' questions without making them feel dumb. Goes through lecture relatively quickly but can always ask her to reiterate. | Overall very thorough and effective professor. Has frequent office hours and never leaves a stone unturned when covering material. | She's truly a good teacher, but she seems to be unprepared sometimes and was corrected a couple of times usually by herself or another student. She is apologetic for it and redoes it. I had 5 exams and roughly 3 of them were quite hard. Highly recommend her as a teacher, go to her office hours and her test reviews and you should minimally get a C. | Awesome professor, she is very dedicated to her class. Though the lectures aren't mandatory, they are extremely valuable and definitely worth your time. | I really enjoyed her class! Material is difficult but the professor was very good at explaining. | Prof. Frizzell is absolutely amazing! Her lectures are organized/clear, she updates Canvas with all the material, and responds promptly to emails. She is very understanding and willing to help students. The exams related to this course are handled by the course coordinator, but if you listen to lectures and do the exam reviews, you should do well. | Probably my favorite professor, very nice and you can see she is constantly trying to improve and accommodate students. That being said since the course coordinator is controlling the course and writing the exams, the class is hell, and you can tell that Frizzel is unhappy and hates how the course is structured and the fact that everyone is failing | Professor Frizzell is very understanding and willing to work with students. Although she is very nice, calc 3 as a course is one of the harder math courses I have encountered."
"Hovsepyan, Narek","does not do any practice problems in lecture. best thing about him is no graded attendance. watch youtube to learn because he just does not help at all. one time we were 3 chapters ahead before we took the first exam. whenever someone asks a question, he says ""we don't have time, talk to be after class."" as if were not 3 chapters ahead of schedule. | A decent professor and is very knowledgeable in the subject. It can be hard to pay attention in class, but doing so is crucial. It's not an easy class, especially in the second half, and you must prepare. However, he gives several worksheets and questions to help you prepare for the exams and makes the final lectures as review sessions. | I really enjoyed the lectures, he is very knowledgeable and smart. The first two exams were pretty easy, however for some reason he made final pretty hard. But overall good experience, just go to lectures and take notes! | Hovsepyan gives great lectures, however, he teaches purely on the chalkboard and doesn't post notes or practice problems. The midterms were straightforward so it didn't matter for those. For the final, though, he gave a list of topics many of which weren't covered in class or in the book, leaving you scrambling on google for resources, so be wary. | we had a textbook; prof didn't use the textbook/went off on his own tangent. never provided any specific practice problems for his exams. worst lecturer/professor i've had at rutgers; doesn't care about his students at all. this class made me re-evaluate everything about my life. do yourself a favor and don't take this guy. | out of taking this class and taking the 8am section, i genuinely believe it would have been less painful to impale my arms with rusty nails | Dr.Hovsepyan is a great lecturer, but he does not provide enough practices for students which is crucial for calc sequences. If you have other sources of well-designed problem set, you could take his course; other than that, PLEASE DO NOT. Even if you want to study hard and try to do well, you are gonna find out no help from this course. | Good lectures, horrible organization (251 is coordinated). He diverges from the textbook regularly. He tested us on non-textbook content, refusing to give resources for them. He took very little accountability for his TA repeatedly changing HW deadlines without notice (extremely stressful). Grading policies are poorly defined, and often ignored. | Solid lecturer - always made sure to demonstrate why something is true rather than simply giving us formulas. He is also very good at answering questions and keeping us engaged with the material. He would also occasionally provide interesting follow-up material on Canvas just for curiosity's sake. Definitely would take his class again | He is clear, funny, straight to the point, and always finds a way to answer every student's questions. He is very knowledgeable about math, and it was unbelievable to me how great he was at teaching. I took my first midterm yesterday and it was mostly easy with a lot of time to spare. I currently have an A. His personality makes you want to learn. | Professor Hovsepyan is really nice and he explains concepts super well, and has very organized lectures. He is very approachable with questions and will tell you in detail how to do some problems in office hours. Fair exams. Take him!"
"Zhang, Keyang","Too much homework, too much essay, boring classes..... | too much homework with no effect at all | Her educational approach is quite Chinese, emphasizing rigor and discipline | not good Chinese style education | bad professor | she is a good professor. But her work is hard. | Very easy A. She is a super responsible professor who always offers detailed and thorough comments to each of your writings. You will definitely get an A if you follow her instructions. And it's EAP I, you know, no class will be easier than this. | She is a good teacher for writing. She is fully patient and responsible. | Great professor for writing courses! | Greatest expos professor of all time, please take her if possible. She is super kind and caring and wants to see people do well, offers great advice and encouragement on essay feedback and is extremely nice. | An excellent prof! | Choose her, you won't regret! | She is a great professor. If you have any question, she will answer very patiently. | Her skills and techniques on teaching is very adept. You can never miss her idea or point in class. | She is not a native speaker so sometimes she doesn't understand you when you try to expain things to her. But she is very friendly to students and I can always make an appointment with her to discuss my papers. The other problem is that she is somewhat careless. Sometimes if you don't do homeword and quizzes, she won't notice. | She is really helpful to me, especially as a Chinese student. She offered me a lot of suggestions about how to adapt to the study in America and all kinds of advice of living. Although I got three NPs at first she really helped me a lot in order to pass and deal with my next level writing"
"Mirek, Mariusz","Good professor for 411, and I'd say he's not too difficult. The in-person exams are mostly straightforward without requiring too much creativity, and the open Internet collaborative final was very interesting (though a huge step up in difficulty). He's very understanding (would always extend homework deadlines). He teaches from slides, not Rudin! | Professor Mirek is a very intense lecturer. He teaches from slides, so he goes quickly and with great detail. However, he posts the slides so all the study material is built into the class. He is very accessible outside of class on Zoom. He also doesn't teach out of Rudin, just the slides, but you should read Rudin anyway. Great Prof. | I really appreciate what the teacher has done for us this semester. The lecture is very clear with examples, which also allows me to review after class. I also really enjoyed all problems I did on homework and exams, which were inspiring and thought-provoking. I'm glad to learn math 311 with prof. Mirek~ | Professor Mirek is a good professor, had clear understandable slides. Gives way too much homework but its easy to do from concept in slides plus gives answer key later. Takes time to reply, but is super helpful during lectures to understand the topics better. All midterm and final pretty simple. Made Math 250 fun for me, definitely recommend him! | Mariusz was a genuinely great professor. Very straightforward. He was a super nice guy and was incredibly understanding. Also incredibly responsive to student requests. I usually find math boring and tedious and I genuinely enjoyed Linear Algebra with him, some of the most useful math that I've learned. | Very nice and understanding professor. Take him for Linear Algebra!! He listens to students and always tries his best to accommodate everyone - Exams were lengthy, but his study guides always helped and there was a lot of hw assigned but overall a great course"
"Silverstein, Laura","i had her for calc workshops. she was incredibly hard to reach. didn't respond to emails throughout the semester. took forever grade quizzes and workshops. she's super nice though and really tries to help students learn the material. | She is a very nice and gentle teacher. I really like her. Although she is a bit slow in grading homework, her grading is very clear. The practice exercises before the exam are very useful for the exam. Especially, before the exam, she would have an online pre-exam lecture. The questions presented in the lecture are particularly useful for the exam. | I am extremely disappointed with Professor Silverstein's approach to this course up until this point. Not a single homework, classwork, or exam has been graded. She also overcomplicates the simplest topics in this course, so your best bet is to just watch some YouTube videos outside of class. She's a nice person, but not a good professor. | We are nearly months into the semester, and not a single HW has been graded, nor has the exam we took 2 weeks ago. She doesn't curve anything, even though nearly all 250 professors do. She's kind but not a good professor and doesn't uphold her end of the student-professor deal. No grades, doesn't respond to emails or give feedback. | Professor Silverstein gave pop-worksheets during class and only allowed 3 absences during a semester (where lectures were mandatory). She did not explain concepts well or stay on top of the content—was constantly behind other professors. Overall, made easy things confusing and rarely solved actual problems in class. | We were behind the whole semester compared to other teachers, and she was very unresponsive near the final. The final was nothing like the review, and the class was surprised by the content. There was little to no curve or compensation for our difficulties leading up to the final. However, she was nice and did care a lot about her students. | I really liked Professor Silverstein, and she is SUPER nice and caring, I've genuinely never had a nicer professor. But She wasn't there for our class when we needed her the most, ghosting the class for the final review and finals time. However, that was just an unfortunate thing for our class and I assume it won't happen again hopefully | She was a good professor and a generous grader. She really tried to make sure everyone understood the material. Slow grader but I really regret not trying harder, lol it was only until the end of the class I realized that I liked the subject. If you are willing to study you definitely can get more out of her class than I did. Her exams are fair | Doesn't answer emails. The exam reviews are the only way you'll get clarity on things. You'd be better off skipping and just studying the reviews, they're very similar to the exam. The final review, however, was nothing like the exam. Most of the class studied the review and ended up surprised during the exam. Study the midterms. | a very nice and passionate professor, I can tell she is doing her best, Lectures are not good if you never read the textbook before class, but her lecture slides are helpful once you read the textbook. homework is 1 hour to 2 hours per week, if you don't read the textbook before going to lecture, you will have a hard time. | Good professor, very nice. | She is a very very kind person and does mean well. It is just that she teaches this class too theoretical, she should leave the theory for 350. It confuses half the class and when I took the midterm it was much harder than the few practical examples she went over in class and the hw. Her class is doable, but you need a lot of self learning sadly | Professor Silverstein is a fairly good teacher and is very kind. At times, she gave pretty good examples to help us understand the course content. However, she made many mistakes in her math. She taught at a pretty fast space, trying to cram numerous examples in one lecture, which made pointing out mistakes difficult. | She is a very good person however her classes arent that interesting. I always fell asleep in her classes and stopped attending after a point. She however posted the lecture notes which was helpful. Workshops are extremely difficult and sometimes irrelevant. | Very nice and caring professor who's accessible and willing to help during office hours. However, there's a TON of HW, and it's only 5% of our grade. Workshops are also unnecessarily difficult as no workshop questions really pop up on exams. Overall, good professor but the course structure needs to be changed. | The professor is a math professor who teaches math. | Silverstein is an okay professor however, she explained concepts in a complicated way. She seldomly responded to emails and her office hours are kinda useless I felt more lost every time I went to her OF. Overall, she is a nice human being. | During the course, we got five assignments and we didn't get any feedback until the end of the semester. When she gave out practice exams, she didn't give us the solutions until the night before so we didn't know if we were doing it correctly. She showed us induction wrong, not a good lecturer, and she doesn't curve her grades like other sections. | She is very kind, but her lecturing/teaching style is very flawed. Lectures were often confusing and pointless. She gives tons of homework as well for only 5% of the grade. The homework helps but takes hours to do if you decide to do it properly. Overall she's a nice person but I wouldn't recommend taking her if you're looking for an A. | By far one of the worst professors/teachers I ever had. Neglects questions, rarely answers emails, tells students that theyre going to fail if they dont understand something | Attendance is not mandatory. There are 3 exams and a final which makes up basically the whole grade. Homework is only 5% and she gives around 3-4 per week. Does not answer emails, or does not give extra credit. Seems confused on the concepts she is teaching. Better of Teaching yourself by reading textbook and doing as much practice as possible. | My favorite professor. Great lectures and she is very dedicated to teaching and always available after lecture and office hours to answer questions. Do all the homework and you will be fine. Agree that grading the homework is very slow, but apparently that's done by an undergrad and not her so I will not fault her for it. | Literally the nicest teacher I have ever met. Beyond caring and being passionate about the course. However, she gives TONS of homework. Focuses mostly on proofs in class and not actual calculations. Must learn a lot on your own. 2 exams and a final. If you do better on the final she replaces your lowest exam grade. Office hours/reviews are awesome | Easy class with joke exams (free proofs). 50 homework problems weekly while other professors gave 4. Had trouble staying awake in class due to boredom. Disorganized lectures. Felt like high school class. Made Discord server but was inactive. Refused to display number grade until winter break since it wouldn't be ""accurate"" (not all tests taken yet) | Overall she was okay. There is a lot of hw and no extra credit. However, she does override the grade of the previous exam with the next one if it's higher. 15% HW, 10% for showing up to class the rest % is midterms and finals. Lectures sometimes are boring because of long proofs (some aren't useful to know tbt). Took a long time to get our scores | She could take a bit long to grade, however, I believe that she took time in order to help students succeed in her class. The lectures felt a bit long and the class time based around definitions and proofs of them. However, she provided plenty of time to help students outside of the classroom. She was kind, understanding, and encouraging. | Terrible professor, highly disorganized and makes the material way more confusing than it needs to be. She does not even try to do her job; she didn't post solutions to the HW after the first few weeks. Never replies on the discord SHE MADE. Doesn't reply to emails. Exams are too long/too difficult with no curve. Barely any A's in my class. AVOID! | Shes a nice person, unfortunately this is where the positives end. She teaches like were in HS, takes forever to grade exams, modified the hw set problems halfway through the course (refusing to offer extra credit for people who did previous problem sets ahead of time), assigns hw 3 days before its due, doesnt respond in the Discord SHE MADE, etc | Very disorganized | She is a very good professor, very lively, and very caring. After exams she asks for feedback to improve which is nice. The course is very assignment heavy which is great practice, but, the assignments are not a very high percent of your grade. Silverstein also writes absolutely everything she says down on the board (can be confusing but helpful). | Silverstein covers much less material than other professors but focuses on proofs. She is very slow in teaching but generally effective. Many say that she's disorganized, which is a direct result of how slow her class is. Biggest challenge is not falling asleep (100% serious). She doesn't hit key points well. Instead gives blurry vision of concept. | So far, I think she is a nice person, so I would not say things awful about her. But I would not compliment her lecture and teaching skills. Her workload is extreme and lecture is not really clear. We have nearly 50 questions per lecture while other class have like five or six. I would not recommend even I could tell she is nice and caring. | Math 285 is not supposed to be simple by any means, you have to put in your time to get the material. However, if she was more accessible outside of class, it would have helped so much more. Uses discord which she never checks. | In short, you will need to learn the material on your own time. Since professor Silverstein teaches her classes heavily on logic and proofs, it feels like it is very hard to get a gist of how to do the actual calculations/algorithm. It would be really helpful if professor Silverstein pair each proof with examples that explicitly show how they work | She's really caring and wants her students to do well, but I found her lectures really hard to follow and had to learn a lot of stuff from the book. Her examples felt super unclear and she went really fast through the examples, basically the entire class was doing more writing, then understanding. I learned more on my own with the book. | Silverstein was my first math professor at Rutgers and probably one of the best one I ever had. She provides numerous resources, is accessible through discord, and her grading is completely fair. It's not an easy A though, as tests are tricky at times, but if you look over her review sheets and thoroughly review and compete homework, you're fine. | Even though I failed this class, this professor is one of the most caring professors I've ever met. Although she rarely ever opens her emails and her lectures are somewhat disorganized, I still don't blame her for failing the class. | She is a bit disorganized when teaching but she's willing to work with you and help you succeed in her class if you show that you are putting in the work. She's really helpful and encouraging all the time. Office hours are really helpful, she's good at explaining stuff, you just need to ask for clarification. Overall a good professor | Professor Silverstein was my first math teacher at Rutgers so I dont know what to compare her with but my experience with her was positive. She gives you many resources of which you can prepare and do well in the class and then it is up to the student to put in the effort. There are 2 midterms and a final and she gives some extra credit on both. | This class is conceptual and problem salving based. She made it easier to understand the material and even offered free supplemental videos to use on top of lectures. Exams are fair and if you do the homework you should have no problem doing well. | Linear Algebra is a tough class, but Professor Silverstein made it manageable. I have been to her office hours and she does an amazing job at explaining things. I agree with the other raters that she is disorganized sometimes, but she offers free videos that have really helped. Great Professor. | By far this professor cared the most out of all my professors I had this semester about her students. Accessible outside of class via Discord and gives great feedback and tips on homework. Homework heavy but she's very good at teaching and explaining concepts and is very patient and truly wants students to understand content. Very respectable | Very caring and kind professor but her lectures are very messy, disorganized, and can be frustrating to sit through. She focuses lectures mostly on theory and wordy definitions and some lectures didn't even have examples of the material. Homeworks are long but she has good office hours, always willing to help. Overall probably would take again. | Professor Silverstein is one of the best professor that I've been met in Rutgers. Although sometimes her lectures are a little bit disorganized, she is willing and able to help you if you have any questions. She also give us a chance to replace one of our midterm using our final grade, which saved my grade eventually. | Rather disorganized during lectures so self-learning is mandatory. Otherwise, very nice and willing to help. Tests are doable if you know what you are doing, and she's lenient on grades as long as she sees that you understand the concept. She also drops a midterm grade if you scored better on the final. Overall, a solid professor for a hard class. | Precalc is hard no matter what prof, but her lectures were messy and she seemed unprepared. She was very kind and provided extra office hours for exams. The recitation prepared me better for exams than this prof did, but she wasn't horrible. The average for exams was always a failing grade, but put in a lot of work and you'll pass. | Gem of a teacher. Loves to interact with the class and lets everyone relax by playing music before class starts. She always listens to everyones questions in the chat box and posts clear PDFs/recordings of the lectures in case you miss a class. Recitations were easy 1 question sheets graded for completion unlike other sections who had mini tests. | Professor Silverstein is one of the best professors I have taken. If you did the homework, recitation, and the pre-lecture videos, they were 100s while other classes had quizzes, Silverstein did not. Calc-135 is a hard course but if you study, it will be fine. She had amazing lectures which actually helped and was always accessible for office hours | She has 2 years teaching experience. Pros: V Nice,Responsive,Good office hrs. Cons:tough exams, unlike any of her lectures. Goes into detail about things ""we shouldnt know"", which is confusing and wastes time. Other classes were ahead of us until 1.5 months into the course. Lectures dont teach you anything unless you had some prior knowledge. | She gave no extra credit to my class. Our 2 exams both had no curve even though the average for both was less than 65% (but our final had a curve). Lots of homework and quiz every week. Precalc is a really hard class taking it in one semester was definitely hard because of how fast we go. I honestly just wanted to pass the class and I did. | Do not listen to any other negative reviews of kids who failed the class from not studying. This is a hard class and every section takes the same test so it is an equal playing field. Unlike other professors, Silverstein had no recitation quizzes and just 2 5 min lecture hws for an easy 100 as 15% of your grade. I am awful at math but still passed | Final was very difficult for Fall 2020. | Prof Silverstein is really kind and caring, and you can tell she definitely cares about her students. Calc 135 at Rutgers is really hard by nature, so the class is hard. It's hard no matter who your professor is. But Silverstein encourages you to go to office hours, and she grades the exam pretty fairly. She also listens to our feedback on exams."
"Gilat, Shira","chill and easy in the summer, would recommend it. nice lady | Prof Gilat a W teacher. HW every week but you can chegg it if you don't know what's going on that week. Tests are open note and was prob the first time I actually had to learn something instead of just memorizing stuff. Use 3Blue1Brown to understand concepts. Definitely never go to office hours after exams, nothing def everr good comes from it | Homework every week w/ bunch of questions. Lectures are pretty boring but she gets through a lot and it is worth it to go. She is so sweet and does help if you need. Does not take points off for calculation errors on midterms as long as you do the work right. Midterms are open book. Really easy class if you get the fundamentals down. Great prof. | A lot of care goes into the notes that she provides to her students during lectures. Aside from occasional technical mishaps, her lectures are paced extremely well and are presented in an easily digestible format. If you are diligent about going to lectures and taking notes, you will get a solid grade and a genuine understanding of the content. | Solid teacher. Explains the material and answers students' questions well. Grades very efficiently and fairly. | Prof Gilat was one of my favorite professors, she is very responsive to questions and is always open to talk about some cool topics in the field. Very generous grader and made abstract algebra (at least the introductory level) very very easy | Do. Not. Take. This. Professors. Class I will say Professor Gilat was one of the hardest professors ever. In my opinion, was not the best professor at ALL. She was a very hard grader, did not curve anything, her tests were literally just 4 questions... Quizzes were tough, and she was not helpful at all. | Her lecture style wasnt really for me. Requires lots of work outside of class to understand the material. Her midterms were also a little harder than the other professors, although she did curve them. Decent professor only if you put in the right amount of work on your own time. | Overall, a decent lecturer that made a difficult subject easier to understand. However, outside studying will definitely be required if you are to pass this class. Exams are difficult, and do not include many questions. This means if you do not know one thing, good luck. Overall nice person who seems to care about her students, but no cake walk. | Professor Gilat does not make tests that are at all similar in terms of question style to the homework we receive. Moreover, her tests are 40 minutes with 3 questions and 2 true/false making our grade dependent on small yet incredibly specific tests | Her style of lecturing was not for me. She would straight up read from the textbook. None of her lectures were clear enough to actually understand the material. She would always skip over steps and never explain things. Her exams were hard and she graded very harshly. | She is a really nice professor that makes her tests and quizzes pretty easy. She really does care about her students and will try her best to answer any question that's thrown at her. However, she teaches this class in a way that you have to do x number steps to get the answer rather than giving a reason as to why you're actually doing that step. | I really enjoy her lectures but only after I watch a youtube video showing the topic visually and what is actually going on. She is very proof-heavy, but if you are genuinely interested you will like her. She handwrites(no slides) and uploads all her notes on canvas which I find very helpful to understand, and especially for her tests. | TBH she isn't that good of a teacher. Her explanations are vague and her lectures will put you to sleep. Most of the work in this class will be based on self-studying that is if you want to pass. Her tests are somewhat difficult and require you to know your proofs and concepts. | She curves tests a lot. Her lectures and notes are very helpful but get monotonous at some point. Her quizzes and tests are not too tough. Not so accessible outside class."
"Ketover, Daniel","His lectures are fast and tests are difficult, but that's just the nature of Calc 3. His handwriting also isn't great (especially with his online notes). Otherwise, he can still be understood clearly during lectures, he's very interactive with his students, and he takes feedback from students often. Don't skip his lectures if you want to do well. | Ketover's lectures are very thorough and easy to follow, with many useful example problems during lecture. He readily answers questions during lecture and gives plenty of study material for exams (4 practice tests each). Each lecture is content heavy, so be wary of skipping. After Thanksgiving break, the lectures speed up a huge amount. | Nice professor. His teaching style is way easier to understand than other professors. He gives a lot of visual examples and is very lenient with the exams. As long as you pay attention in lectures and do the practice exams, you should be doing pretty fine in his class. | Very good lecturer. Makes jokes in class and keeps it very engaging. Provides very helpful examples for visualizing difficult material, even towards the end of the semester when hard material is rushed. Recitation quizzes are on the tougher side. Very good professor, take him if you can. | Top tier professor. Clear, straight to the point, organized lectures. Would even crack funny jokes during lectures. His quizzes are a bit on the tougher side but they prepare you very well for the exams. Would highly recommend. | Really good professor. | Great prof. Lectures were clear, fast, and not that boring. It's easy enough if you go to lecture and don't fall behind on hw. | DAN THE MAN KETOVER. This guy is the greatest! As a person and a teacher, he's great. He's super caring, a great lecturer and always sprinkles in some comic relief along with some sass. Dont get me wrong, Math 251 isn't an ""easy"" class. But he will give every opportunity to succeed. He's very approachable and answers every question during lecture. | ONE OF THE BEST! | Dan thoroughly explains the concepts within this course with a great degree of detail and insight. He makes the difficult concepts of this course easy to understand for his students, setting him apart from other professors and allowing his students to achieve a great deal of success. You will have a great time by taking Dan #squiglysquares | Dan is the man! He is my hero. Changed my life! He's an amazing professor who is extremely thorough in his lectures. His examples are great, and his lectures really helped me to understand Calc 3. | Daniel Ketover changed my life for the better in every way imaginable. His lectures are each individually crafted to deliver as much knowledge as possible, and his sassy delivery keeps the audience engaged until the end. Would take again. #SquigglySquares | Dan's lectures are excellent and engaging. If you want a fun learning experience, take this professor!! HE CHANGED MY LIFE. | Ketover is my favorite professor I've had so far at Rutgers. Really, the only thing you need to do to get a good grade in his class is to show up to his lectures and pay attention. He makes the lectures interesting and interactive and I never got bored in his class. Take Ketover if you are ever given the chance. | Best professor by far. He does go really fast through lectures, and you will need to do ALOT of practice on your own to ensure you will not fail the course. | Fantastic lecturer, really funny and chill. Explains things really clearly. | It literally does not get better than Ketover. He genuinely cares about his students and relies heavily on their feedback to make the class as fair as possible. He is also a good lecturer and an understanding grader. He turned calc 5 into a class that was not too difficult. Would highly recommend. | He is great! Decent grader and had funny lectures. The class materials were fun too. Never gets bored with his lectures. Quizzes were hard, but after he gave out practice quizzes before the real one, they are just a piece of cake. | This class was hard. Luckily, I took a pretty light course load so I had time. The first midterm was just a matter of knowing formulas. The second midterm really required you to understand conceptually spherical/cylindrical coordinates. The final was crazy hard but was graded really lightly. Ketover was a nice guy, and explained things pretty good. | He is a very nice guy. Always tries to do better but he does move very fast in lectures. The material is very hard so you do need to do extra studying on your own. Some of the examples he would review would be easier than the problems given on the homework, exams, and quizzes but he does really try to make sure you guys understand. | Lowkey one of the best professors I have had. The lectures definitely go very fast but that is the nature of the course. Reviewing notes after lectures is a must. He is very caring and receptive to student input, and that is what has made him better this year, as exams have become more straightforward and he offers more resources for us to succeed. | He goes really fast in lectures so going over the material again is a must. Very generous with pushing deadlines. Exams were reasonable however quizzes are extremely difficult but he said don't worry about them . Nice guy, lectures didn't make me want to fall asleep. | He is a great teacher with hard exams but expect the exams the have a huge curve. Pay attention in class do homework and you should be fine | Unfairly difficult exams. He doesnt give much introduction when he starts a new topic and jumps right into hard examples, assumes everybody knows basics. He moves on too fast and doesnt explain properly. Definitely a nice guy but hurts you GPA and you probably have to work out of the class to learn material on your own. | Hes an great lecturer and listens to student input. However his exams can be unreasonably difficult. | If you go to his office hours for help, you should be fine. Lots of homework. Often times rushes through information, could have a better approach."
"Li, Chi","HW started out rough (10 problems assigned weekly), though he decided to relax this quickly. Lecture wasn't great; he would sometimes read out of the textbook while lecturing. Also, not the most clear during lecture. | This professor has an excellent understanding of the course and it reflects through his approach and grading criteria. I appreciate that the professor was able to illustrate the concepts of this course with images and find his criteria to be fair and well communicated. You'll need to read the textbook and do the homework. Take his class seriously. | He's a nice guy, and very smart. However, he's not very good at teaching. and lectures can get boring. Be sure to go over concepts before lecture (if you decide to attend), since he pretty much expects students to already know what he is going over, rather than actually introducing the material prior to just jumping into complex problems. | Take this professor if you have a perfect understanding and can master any calculus problem thrown at you, or if you are an international student. But for a normal American college student taking calc 135 with Chi Li, it won't go so well, the curves are generous this year but this professor definitely destroyed that. | I learn more at home than in his class, his class is so useless while he just rambles about some textbook way to solve problems. I have observed about 85% of his attendance stopped showing up. This guy may be a nice guy in no universes, but he does sometimes make fund of his 15 students that still show up to his lectures. | He is a great person who has an amazing understanding of calculus but is in general a bad teacher who makes calc harder than it is by complicating problems. He has everyones best interest at heart but cannot teach you and most people self study. Attendance of lectures are around 20% of the class. | If you are coming into Calc 135 with anything but a perfect understanding on calculus concepts, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. While Chi Li is very intelligent and is an absolute math wiz, teaching is just something he can't do. Lectures went from 100% to 10% attendance. Everyone in my section just learns from Dr. G YouTube videos or Org. Chem. Tutor. | He is a nice guy but it is really hard to understand him and his process of solving equations. He doesn't explain much, he speaks softly, so you can barely hear him. Office hours don't really help, I learned through Dr. G's videos and youtube. He will do a review lecture the day before the exam but it doesn't help. He will randomly call on you. | Chi Li is a great professor who really cares about his students. Only issue is that his lectures are not enjoyable and he is usually monotone. If you go to class and pay attention you can definitely pass the class but skipping lectures makes the class very difficult. | Not going to crap on the guy but rather strictly rate him for his teaching ability. He is definitely, at heart, passionate about teaching calculus-- given by his intelligence. He is intelligent, but frankly he just can not teach. No one even shows up to the lectures anymore and most of the class watches Dr. G's YouTube videos to teach themselves. | He's well intentioned fs, but a terrible teacher, I'm sorry... It's been over a month of classes and as someone who thinks class attendance is v important, I've stopped showing up, and so has 80% of the class. I've already done calc ab, and I genuinely feel myself understanding content I've already learned LESS after attending his lectures. Beware | Professor Chi Li, my professor, may not be the one I wanted but I got. His lectures are extremely, exceedingly, tremendously, extraordinarily, outstandingly, supremely, remarkably easy to fall asleep in. He can convince you that 2 + 2 is 5, but if you glace at your phone you would miss his rigorious genius explanation. | Chi Li pronounced ""Kylie"" is just different as a professor. His teachings are so I formative, that he just annotates every single possible way to solve a problem. The amount of knowledge he pumps into us during the first couple lecture were so informative that people simply stopped showing up. Do Not confuse him as a female. If you have him, GL. | Seems like a nice guy but hey he isnt the best one to teach you calc. He tries his hardest but absolutely fails at it, just like his students. You will need to study externally hard to understand what he is saying , and he speaks low so please ask him to get a mic next class. Overall not a great experience | Honestly, he is a sweet and caring guy. He knows a lot about what he is talking about but frankly, he is just far too hard to understand. My entire Calc lecture has dwindled down in numbers significantly and it has only been 2 weeks of classes so far. Kids just show up to recitation and don't even attend the lectures. | On the first day of the lecture, the room is about 100% full, on the second day, the room was about 75% full, third lecture, 50%, in the fourth lecture, less than 25% of the students bothered to show up. His lectures are incoherent and hard to understand, he does a terrible job of explaining during the lecture. Lastly, he needs a mic. | Most days he ate, but some he thought he ate. Exams and quizzes were straightforward as he tells you specifically which hw questions we were going to be tested on which is clutch. We had 2 matlabs which weren't bad as he posted outlines of them. Overall, he was a good teacher, quick grader, and was very organized!"
"Li, Zongyuan","We covered barely any material compared to the other professor's section. No matrix exponentials... He is very focused on qualitative analysis more than solving equations. Generally good explanations, and he's a very nice guy. Low amount of homework. Exams harder than homework, but easy if you understand what you're doing. Very slight curve if any. | His lecture notes are clear and understandable but he assigns TOO MUCH homework. Attendance is not mandatory and he is always available during office hours. He gives sample test papers for practice (not a mandatory assignment) before exams. The lowest grade of homework will be dropped and he will give bonus points (an extra problem) in final exam. | Always available, Professor Li Zongyuan is very kind and friendly and does his best to understand his students and give what's best for them (office hours & practice exams). He gives good rationale for errors on exams and gives points back when he makes a mistake. Work-wise, exams were a bit difficult so you need to grind on them. | First off he is a very nice professor that gives direct answers. His lectures are nice and simple and his test and quizzes are pretty easy if you pay attention in class. The only con would be that he is monotone and it feels like hes teaching straight out of the book word for word. But that is easy to get over within the first days of class. | Great professor. Incredibly nice and very approachable. The class is a lot of work, but he give ample opportunities for you to get a good grade. | Such a kind soul, really enjoyed his class. Hes a good one, knows his material, and very dedicated to his students. Very impressed by this class"
"Kriventsov, Denis","The best math teacher I've ever had | Mr Kriventsov was a great teacher but sometimes went off on tangents that confused the class. A lot of questions on midterms stemmed from some abstract concepts in lecture so it would be helpful to go regardless of attendance. The 2 midterms and final were 80% of the grade so its very top heavy -- if you know the computational methods youre good. | Note that this is a review for MATH 252, not linear algebra (wasn't an option in the dropdown). Very easy-going guy who has a genuine interest in teaching mathematics. He always tells you more-or-less exactly what he expects from you, and gives you a good idea of what the grade cutoffs are like after each exam. An 84% was an A for our class. | Kriventsov does teach the subject well, but his exams are a little harder than other professors. If you never taken linear algebra in HS before, do the suggested problems in the textbook because the Matlab does not prepare you for exams. | He's a pretty good lecturer who makes analysis interesting, exciting even! 311 is a very difficult class in general so there was definitely lots of reading and homework (which is to be expected) but I always looked forward to his lectures. He may come off as a bit intimidating but he's very easy to approach and accommodating. Definitely recommend!"
"Jauslin, Ian","I had him for 291 & 477. Very by-the-book lecturer. Super organized, writes compactly(make sure you know your math notation!), and comes prepared. His tests are fairly short, more theoretical than computational. He's amazing at answering questions, even if it's a touch vague he can usually tell what you're getting at and explain it more precisely. | Prof.Jauslin is a nice professor. He tries to explain everything as easy as possible to let you understand. His lecture is clear and always gives good examples. And he will give study guide and practice exams before midterms and final. Those are quite helpful for me. :) | Good professor, this is actually for Math 477 (I have no option to change the class number) but class was straightforward and he is a nice lecturer. Homework was short but contained challenging problems. | Although a very difficult class, Prof. Jauslin made the class easy to understand and fun. Be warned though, the course load is significant and this class isn't for everyone. But if you love math, you'll have a great time; he takes care in answering questions and hosts helpful recitations. He also made our class interactive and posts helpful labs. | An amazing lecturer who is very organized in his presentation. He presents some of the content in interesting and engaging ways (like bringing instruments to class), and overall it's a fun experience. I thought that a differential equations course would be computational and not interesting, but Professor Jauslin's 292 defied these expectations."
"Mondal, Priyadip","Very nice professor. Lectures are alright, he mostly goes through the textbook problems and examples but actively encourages questions. Midterms are easy but final was very conceptual, which threw me off guard. As long as you participate during lectures, you should do fine in his class. | Priyadip was a nice guy. He always extended the homework if he saw many people weren't able to complete it in time. Calc 3 itself is not as hard as 1/2 and I wouldn't say he was the BEST professor but he was good enough. The best chance to get a good grade in this class regardless of who your professor is, is to do the homework. | I felt I learned very little from lecture, and most of my learning came from the textbook. I will say that Proffesor Mondal did take time to ensure that he moved at good pace during lecture. But our class was quite behind, so much of the material on our final exam we had barely learned. | Mondal teaches well but slow. Slow enough in which the last couple weeks will overwhelm you and the final exam being a pain. Every time he questions the pace of the class, always say go faster. Advice: Do the Pearson HW before going into the recitations and do all of the practice exams the department gives you."
"Gunby, Benjamin","This was apparently his last semester teaching at Rutgers :( Had him for Graph Theory. Professor Gunby is a very fair and cool guy. 30% HW/70% Exams, but he gave extra credit and was super helpful in office hours. Exams were pretty difficult but graded generously. He did go over lecture time occasionally but he was otherwise an awesome professor. | Professor Gunby is amazing. He's super interested in math and very approachable and friendly at office hours, and is a great instructor on top of all of that. Math 300 was certainly a bit challenging but he gives you more than enough to do well. I don't think I would have ever found any interest in math if not for him. He probably changed my life. | I'll start with the flaw -- homework takes so much time and is so difficult! Unimaginable difficulty. His class was harder than the honors section! Now, the good things: His exams are reasonable, he is an EXCELLENT teacher, and he is friendly and personal with students. If you want a challenge, take his course, but be warned -- he is VERY HARD! | Let M = {math professors at Rutgers} and g = Benjamin Gunby. Theorem. g = max(M) Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists p in M such that p > g. This is a contradiction by the Gunby postulate. Therefore, g is an upper bound of M. Since g is an element of M, g = max(M). This concludes the proof. QED"
"Ali, Abid","Horrible teaching. Listening to his lectures is a waste of time. Suggest studying on your own. The grading is strange, same answers, someone right someone wrong, makes it seem like he can't do it himself. | Hard homework questions, always assigns a lot of work | Look it's COVID, This man just CAN'T teach online."
"Cao, Yunbai","Great lecturer with organized notes. Always be willing to provide support as long as you ask for help. Fairs exams. Go to every lecture, learn the notes, review afterward, spare your effort, ask for help if needed, and you will be fine. | Math 300 is supposed to be hard but I feel that Professor Cao graded too harshly. The three tests are also basically your whole grade. He was a good lecturer and does not go too fast but the subject is hard in itself is difficult. His tests were really difficult and I wish he made them a little easier. The curve at the end is really generous. | 4 quizzes and a final. Exams are very fair, they are based off of the homework and examples he does in class, so look over those to do well. Helpful professor, if you ask questions about homework or concepts he explains them well. Lectures are heavily based off of textbook."
"Larsen, Kasper","He taught the course material well, and his grading schema is very forgiving | Intro to Lin Alg: Prof. Larsen was pretty cool, I am surprised to see his rating so low. He is prone to going on tangents but the bright side is, if you don't understand a concept (even an old one) he will re-explain it right there in class with no judgement, with different approaches until you get it. Forgiving grader, he cares, he's pretty good. | His exams are based off his lectures, so people who do not go are at a disadvantage. otherwise he is a great prof and really fair and nice. | Good professor! My one complaint is that his lectures were confusing. Besides that, it was his 1st sem teaching undergrads so he wasn't perfect, but he implemented our feedback, which improved the class a lot. He also held lots of office hrs. Grading system is also very good and prioritizes your best work. Reasonable, leniently graded homework. 👍 | Extremely easy tests. All computational with little theory. Lectures abstract compared to course content, but useful (and pretty interesting) nonetheless. Grading scale is VERY lenient (only counts midterms that helps your grade). | Very friendly and passionate about his field with a lenient grading scheme. Quite possibly goated. | Its hard to follow his lectures so just review the textbook and you'll be fine. The grading is very lenient and but the class is test heavy. Just actually do the homework and you'll do fine. Prof overall is very good. | Professor Larsen is a really good guy that is very passionate about what he teaches. But personally I did not enjoy his lectures because they would be very unorganized. His grading system is very very generous and fair. His Exams (Which are basically quizzes) are really easy. Honestly if you put in the effort you will get the grade you want. | The professor is pretty good imo. But his lectures arent really that great. They don't follow a flow and often times differ quite a lot from the textbook. He is quite knowledgable but is not able to teach it properly. I like his grading system. Even though he keeps 4 midterms the freedom of choosing which tests to keep and how much the finals weigh | Very friendly teacher who understands the difficulty of their class. The lectures are very convoluted and there are few resources provided to study besides office hours and recommended textbook problems, which pale in comparison to the few question tests given. Course textbook is very helpful, but sounds very different from the lectures themselves."
"Cakoni, Fioralba","(took her class in fall 2023, not sure if things have changed now). The exams were too difficult. The midterms were difficult but at least the average student could solve half of the problems, but the final was unreasonably too difficult. Most students left the room after half an hour bc of how difficult it was. Don' t take this course with her. | This class is a tale of two sides. On the one hand, lectures are very difficult to follow, and the homeworks are near impossible. This professor does almost no concrete examples during lecture, and focuses on the concepts, which makes learning harder. On the other hand, the exams are EXACLTY LIKE THE REVIEW SESSIONS. Also she is a lenient grader. | Cakoni is definitely a super nice lady but I am not a big fan of this class's format(Aschrounous). She has a heavy accent and bad at explaining the concept. You really need to understand the material to do well in this class. | Fioralba was one of the best lecturers I've had in the math department. She wants to make sure you understand topics conceptually. By understanding the big picture you can complete the proofs more easily. Thus, going to class is vital. However, real analysis is not an easy class; you need to make use of office hours too. Solid choice though. | Amazing professor with a funny personality. Tests were of the same difficulty as homework if not slightly easier. She stresses understanding the concepts and is very forgiving for making basic errors while doing calculations. | A literal ANGEL. Tests are fair, and she genuinely wants each one of her students to succeed. She offered some extra credit, and a replacement policy of a midterm grade if you do better on the final. Wouldn't have taken linear with anyone else, and would honestly just retake this class to be in her presence. my luv."
"Zeilberger, Doron","Professor Z is engaging and cares about students. While lectures can be uneven, he's receptive to feedback and provides great support through office hours, tutoring, and a helpful class website. Using unstuck study and the free textbook can make this manageable course even easier. | Amazing professor who grades fairly. He also gives students chances to make up for poor performance on midterms. Actively interacts with his classroom, and he learns the names of as many students as he can. | The sweetest teacher (& he's funny). Everything was explained so clearly and he's really nice. Told him my name once and he remembered for the entire semester. Exams are pretty easy and he gives alot of quizzes, so you have several chances to increase your grade. Homework does get checked but for completion. Would highly recommend him! | Pretty fire prof and keeps you locked. Class itself is hard but nothing crazy. | Dr. Z is my favorite professor in the math department. I took his experimental math class (which I also highly recommend!) before he was my advisor. He is the ideal advisor. He really cares about his students succeeding, is super accessible/makes time for students, gives great problems but also lets you choose your own, and is very supportive | The best graduate class in the department. Maybe the best period! Lots of programming and reading required to keep up. Note that it's a real-deal graduate class. Most of the work is optional, but you get out what you put in. If you really do all the homework (and there is a monumental amount of it suggested), then you will be a real expert. | Dr. Z is an excellent research advisor! He came up with many interesting projects for me to poke at, and was always helpful if I got stuck. We had weekly meetings where I would report on my progress, which gave me motivation to stay on task. Also he co-organizes the experimental math seminar, which I would highly recommend to all! | Free A as long as you attend class and do homework (based on completion). No exams. One final group project. Boring lectures and topic (coding theory & cryptography -- I liked cryptography only). Excessive use of Maple. EVERYTHING INVOLVES MAPLE. Such a horrible language. At least it's an easy course... | Dr. Z is one of the BEST profs at Rutgers. He rlly cared about students' learning experience and made the classroom enjoyable. He made lin opt an easy to understand class, exams were like the hw and quizzes, and made class fun. Take him!! | Great professor, who really connects with everyone on a personal level. He also gives out little tokens of money if you correct his mistakes and do well on the tests. Very sweet and appreciative. He tries to remember everyone's name and shouts in class (not in a rude way, but rather playfully), which is really funny and keeps the class active! | Dr. Z is a great guy, who is very straightforward, funny, and fair. His exams are fair and he does not try to trick you. Practice attendance quizzes and real quizzes (Definitely study for the real quizzes or they can come back to bite you) Homework was difficult compared to the exams, but gave a great conceptual understanding of the material, GOAT | He's a legend. The material is dry, but he gets you to pay attention: He's a funny guy and gives you money if you correct him on mistakes. Exams are weighted heavily but they are very fair/easy and he even lets you retake them if you do poorly. While attendance is mandatory and he gives a lot of quizzes, you are still in good hands if you take him. | I don't understand how this professor has received such high reviews. His lectures are unorganized and hard to understand, reading the book was much easier. There is mandatory attendance and no phone policy. Class grade is 80% exams 10% quizzes, assigns mandatory HW for 0 points (you get a 0 on the weekly quiz if you do not complete it). Avoid him. | He is a great professor. Cares a lot about his students and wants everyone to do well. He created opportunities to help students that didn't do well on the midterm exams so they could still get a good grade in the class. He also gives a ton of practice material and is always free to help! Best math professor at Rutgers. | He left our class due to an injury, but acted as my tutor over email. He is the BEST PROFESSOR EVER. He is so compassionate towards students and really cares about helping his students. Taking his class is an opportunity everyone must take. The chemistry department needs to learn from him and take notes. I love this guy to death. | This was the first time Dr. Z taught this class, and it showed in that he didn't have the best examples the first time he went over something. He always went over whatever wasn't clear in the last lecture. Very strict on no phone usage and you have to show up to class. He's very accessible outside of the class with office hours and free tutoring. | Hard to describe Dr. Z in a few words here. BEST PROFESSOR EVER HAD. He is EXTREMELY HELPFUL, always punctual, available for office hours. AMAZING WEBSITE. Always post solution of quizzes and exams on the same day. He makes all topics extremely easy. Two extra chances with doing extra problems even if you do badly in both exams. I loved this class. | I took for the first time with DR.Z this semester (MAT 354). I will take further classes with Dr. Z for sure in the future. HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR I EVER HAD. DR. Z really cares for student and gives two extra chances if by chance you did badly in both midterms. I will recommend to sit on the first row and don't skip class. Will miss this class. | I had professor Doron for linear optimization class. I loved his class. He did everything possible to teach you the material. He always was available to help and explain the material during class and during his office hours. He also provide tutoring hours for extra practice. He has his own website that is very helpful. | Professor Zeilberger is the best. He cares for his students. He is very accessible outside of class and he will patiently answer your questions. He also has a very clear syllabus and he gives easy quizzes. The midterms and final are a little bit tricky but never difficult. He yells at students but in a cute and funny way. Must take for 354! | From what I understand, this is his first time teaching the class, and it shows. His reviews for the exam was never timed correctly (1/3 material covered) and he was under-prepared clear examples for some topics. Additionally, he would call questions stupid and be rather disparaging. Not the best environment. No curve. Opps for grade redemption. | Do you like professors who refer to their students and their questions as stupid? Or stop class to admonish a student for looking down at their phone? Or thinks an effective lecture style is to yell at random times? Then Prof. Z is for you. This guy has no respect for the intellect of undergrads and it shows in how basic the class material is. | Best professor ever, his lectures are incredibly entertaining. Be sure to join his second chance club! | His lectures are extremely entertaining. His grading criteria is very established. Also if you don't do as well towards the beginning of the semester he gives you a chance to still do well. It is a little bit hard to get an A since there is no curve but with the second chance and hard work you can do it. Awesome professor | His lectures are extremely entertaining. His grading criteria is very established. Also if you don't do as well towards the beginning of the semester he gives you a chance to still do well. It is a little bit hard to get an A since there is no curve but with the second chance and hard work you can do it. Awesome professor. | He gave the class 2 second chance opportunities if you did badly on the midterm exam. On midterm 1 I got 65; worse, midterm 2 I got 45. However, I got 187/200 on final exam because I worked hard and did all the practice exams and previous exams, which Dr.Z gave us to do it!!! As a result, I got an A!!! Dr.Z is the best Math professor on Rutgers!!! | Dr. Z is one of the best professors that I've taken a class with. He is a real scientist. Comparing to other new inexperienced teachers in Rutgers Math dept., he certainly should be the one you choose. Although he can be annoying sometimes, he is overall friendly to students. | I took 152 with him back in 2012 and used his handouts and practice exams to study for calc 3. The problem is they teach you only basics. There is no way you would pass the class using only these materials with other professors. He is good if you need serious help with algebra, but not the actual subj. Teaches you how to do things as a procedure. | He is indeed a pretty impressive professor. Unlike some mathematics professor who doesn't like coding, he seems to enjoy it, which makes him special. He has some specific requirements like strict attendance of the lectures, no cell phones over the lectures,etc, which could be annoying but definitely helps to focus on the class. Exams are fair. | Great teacher for all types of students. His practice tests are very different than his actual tests, but prepare you well. He motivates you to work really hard and learn the material. | His practice tests are like actual tests. Several people get perfect 100% on the exam because of that. The only thing you need to do is to memorize the practice test. | Amazing! Great lecture notes and is VERY compassionate about his students. He will make the effort to work with you in improving your grade. Students have the chance of curving their grade by a whole letter grade if you submit extra credit (time consuming but very worth it). He makes Calc 4 simple and is very fair with exams. TAKE DR. Z!!! | I love this class because I always learn something new. There is such a wide range of topics to immediately apply what you have learned. I greatly improved my problem-solving skills. | I learned so much in this class. He inspired me to solve a really difficult problem posed by Donald Knuth. | Some years ago,as an undergrad at Rutgers,I attended a talk by Dr.Z on Pi Day. I still remember how much fun it was. So when I saw that he was teaching a course this fall, I returned to my alma mater. The class was challenging, fun, and innovative. Thanks to the amazing Dr.Z, I learned enumerative and algebraic combinatorics really well. | I learned how to use experimental mathematics effectively and efficiently. | Dr. Z is a very fun, friendly and excellent teacher. He challenged me to solve many interesting problems from the Amer. Math. Monthly. I learned a lot in the experimental math class, improved my Maple programming skills and problem solving skills greatly. | I learned so much from the challenging programming assignments. | Even though the subject matter was algebraic combinatorics, the computer algebra skills that I learned will be very useful in my research on graph theory. | Dr. Z. is, by far, the best math professor at Rutgers. Despite being a genius and world-renowned in his field, he is super friendly, funny, and cares about students. Only a fool would dislike this man. He also has a very nice mustache. | His practice tests are actual tests, with numbers changed. All you need to do to get an A is to memorize the practice exam. | He makes the class so that any student could pass. As a result, he teaches in plug 'n chug style. | Best professor ever!!! If you're a gunner who only cares about doing well compared to others then this isn't the class for you. BUT if you want to really understand calc, do well regardless of whether you are a ""stronger"" or ""weaker"" student, and be constantly entertained then there is no better professor. | He is an interesting person, but he wasn't the best teacher for me. His handouts are extremely basic. He concentrates way too much on students who do poorly. You can get an A without understanding the concepts completely, just by memorizing the solutions of his handouts, as his exams are copies of his handouts/reviews. | First off, he's loud. Very loud. Had him for an 8:40 and never slept. Makes jokes and isn't afraid to josh you. Very energetic and wants you to understand the material. Don't buy the book for this class, because homework is not textbook problems, and he provides clear lecture notes online before every class. | Veritable Combinatorics Extraordinaire | Practice tests Actual tests. Easy As Students Love you. He is a cool guy, but treats you like you are a kid. No challenge in the class. If you came to Rutgers to learn, choose somebody else. | Greatest teacher Ive ever had at Rutgers. | Personally, I didn't like his teaching style. I was expecting to learn more in the course. His handouts are extremely basic and oriented for mediocre students. But I guess that majority likes him. | So far the best professor I've ever had. Cares so much about his students and really wants them to succeed. Attendance is mandatory. Exams aren't too bad, but the final is hard. His lectures are very helpful and he will call you out if you are not taking notes. | Doron is the greatest Rutgers professor. He takes every measure to make sure his students succeed. He has ""Crystal Clear Handouts"" on all Calc 2 concepts, he has free tutoring sessions every week, and he has very fair exams. Above all, he is hilarious and is the only teacher I can wake up to see at 8:40AM. He is an adorable man! Take his class! | Best Professor ever! Made calc 2 so much easier to understand! He gives lots of practice problems for the exams and pulls exams questions from it as well. Go to lecture and do the practice problems and you should get an A. Super nice guy and you won't regret taking calc 2 with him! | Amazing teacher. Probably one of the best teachers I have ever had. He cares so much about his students and puts in effort not to only teach us but also to know us. His teaching methods helped me gain interest in calc 2 and I highly recommend taking him. | Brilliant professor, not a super easy class, offers free tutoring and office hours, he'll answer any questions you have, exams are similar to practice exams but a tiny more difficult, helpful handouts, but take notes in class. Calc's not easy, but if you put in the effort, you can get an A. This is not a class for lazy people. Do the homework. | Wonderful professor! He goes above and beyong to make sure you understand the material. Although there is no curve he gives you options to improve your grade. He explains things very well and often gives you multiple ways to do it. One cool thing about him is he agrees the class is useless encouraging students to use Maple and other programs. | Best math professor ever. Sad he's not teaching 251 next semester. He requires a lot of work but it's worth it. He's a genius. I love his method and everything about that class. | The best professor i've had at Rutgers. He's a real genuine guy and wants to see his students succeed. He will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Attendance is mandatory and he gives non graded quizzes every class to check. Gives out a lot of practice exams/material. Give him your all and his will give you his. | He is the best teacher I've had at Rutgers. He genuinely loves his job, he loves helping his students, and he really keeps everyone engaged in the material. If you spot a correction he gives you money! He learns his students name and is so entertaining. If you have the option to take a math course with him, do it. You won't regret it. | Amazing teacher. Worth taking the class just for him. He is a genius and you learn a ton. | Single best professor I have ever had. Unbelievably clear, no curve, he checks homework, and theres a quiz every week, but by the end of the semester I understood the material a million times better than anyone else I knew in a different section of linear algebra, and found getting an A in the class completely doable. | holy crap. he is amazing. | I took calc 3 with him and he was the man! It was an easy A. But DO NOT take Linear Algebra with him. I am taking the class right now and find it ridiculous. He puts proofs on the exams and also requires an explanation for False AND True statements. Try to avoid him if you can because there are definitely easier professors out there! | I <3 this man. He really cares about his students & is always willing to help. He tries to learn everyone's name especially if you go to his tutoring sessions (very helpful). After you have him he is also always there if you need guidance on life decisions (such as continuing the math major). I wish I could have him for the rest of my math classes! | Had him for Calc3, absolutely amazing. You can tell he's a genius, but he is very helpful and extremely funny. Always has review and ""tutoring"" sessions. If you go, do the practice exams, and do the homework you will not only do well but maybe even enjoy it! | genius and clear! Doesn't curve b/c that unnecessary. Got a 99% on the final with his teaching methodology. | Best professor I've ever had at Rutgers and I have 3 semesters left of college. Very helpful so take full advantage if you need it. He wants you to do well so will do everything in his power to help you. Very clear on what hes teaching and entertaining. | Best teacher of my life. | Best Calc 3 Professor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He even has a page with calc I, calc II, and Calc III notes of every single topic. He is too good for Rutgers !! | GREAT TEACHER! | He is one of the most enthusiastic professors I've ever met in my life.Dr.Z's ever-willing to help, extremely funny and crystal clear way of approach towards the subject makes him a wonderful professor. I loved him!!! :)"
"Mckemmie, Eilidh",Dr. McKemmie was a great lecturer. Her class was fun and fair. She was super accomodating-- she posted lecture notes on Canvas and held Zoom sessions in case you were sick. I wouldn't hesitate to take a class of hers again!
"Ling, Eric","Differential equations is not super hard, and Professor Ling does teach well, when he wants to. He was pretty lazy, making the final grade based off one midterm, and one final. We lost a midterm due to him going on vacation. Grades are not regularly updated making everything very confusing once in a while. | Gave lots of hw at first, but he gladly cut it down when we asked him about it. Notes are super clear, and he gave clean lecture notes before class. Class could feel tedious bc he'd write out everything that was on the given notes, but he explained it well. References textbook often, but not required. Exams were hard, but he's pretty reasonable. | Makes his own notes, very nicely typed up. Textbook is more for reference, he follows his notes. Clear intuitive lectures, exams can be tough if you don't put the work in. Answers any question about material clearly. Great professor, 5 stars"
"Sun, Yuhan","Professor Sun is very nice. He is super patient with all kinds of students and accessible outside the class. His lectures are quite clear and organized. A fortune for our school. | His accent is hard to understand and he wants us to self study from book which is hard, i basically had to self study from prof leonard on yt which i recommend if you have never taken calc 1. Also I have miderm/final sheet if anyone wants selling them for $30 if you take yuhan sun. Dm me on discord Asia | yuhan sun for calc 1 is difficult. His accent is hard to understand and he wants us to self study from book which is hard, i basically had to self study from prof leonard on yt which i recommend if you have never taken calc 1. Also I have miderm/final sheet if anyone wants selling them for $30 if you take yuhan sun. Dm me on discord Asia | I want all students to note this. This professor is by far the worst math professor I have had. Never in my history of taking math all these years have I ever received below an A, yet this professor I received an F. I won't deny that I procrastinate as well, however the professor itself will not get you an A unless you have previously taken calc 1. | extremely test heavy, but the tests are absolutely nothing like what he teaches. please do yourself a favor and dont take him as your prof | The worst math professor ever. I took him for Calculus math/phys and his tests are nothing like what he goes over in class. It is unfair that he's allowed to screw students who are stuck with him. | Very kind and helpful. Always responsive to email, is eager to help. Subject is difficult. Exams are similar to homeworks, practice textbook problems to prepare. Exams are open note. Take him! His notes and lectures are clear and organized. Pay attention in class, he explains things well. | Very good professor. The class is very organized and the notes are very clear, This is a very difficult lesson, but because the professor has become not very hard. Good professor!!!"
"Shi, Ziming","I didn't take calc151, I took calc244 but can't the choice. I was worried when I saw the review before taking the class. It turns out very different. He explains the material very well and is open to questions. He made the exams VERY EASY and as lecture coverage, it was very nice to make our lives easy, especially since he is leaving Rutgers soon. | Dr. Shi is a great teacher and shows his enthusiasm in math. He wants his student to learn. | Don't take him for any class, just trust the reviews | Trust me, he is a really nice guy but he's just horrible at explaining. I learned more by skimming through the textbooks than going to his lectures. | This professor is a college student's nightmare. I feel like very son his teaching will start an apocalypse. H acn't teach at all. Should find another job honestly. I also want to know who on the Rutgers employment comittee gave him this job because I think they are stupid! | He was very lovely, We love him | The professor was extremely hard to understand and it was tough to read his handwriting. Way too much of MyMathLab HW with Quizzes weekly made Calc1 harder. Most of my time just went in getting MyMathLab work done on time and got less time to understand topics properly. Was able to do average in online midterms, but dont recommend him. | Professor Shi is a very nice guy and seems like he cares a lot about what he's teaching. He gives a lot of examples during the lecture and allows you to ask questions in the chat. The people that had a problem with him (for Linear Optimization NOT calc) were just not willing to put in work into the first homework. | I never write reviews but I made an exception for this circumstance. Professor Shi was a great guy don't get me wrong. But nothing of what he taught in lectures correlated to the tests. I cannot understand who is writing all these good reviews for him, they all seem to being saying the exact same thing which makes it seem like one person wrote them | I'm not one to rate a professor harshly, but it is well deserved. He teaches the course at a dragging pace and misses all the relevant information that ends up being on every test, and leaving the students unprepared. He doesn't reply to the emails on time, usually taking forever to reach back. Also, his fake reviews are just distasteful. | Makes me question my life choices. | He talks really fast and doesn't help his students understand the concept. He's more concerned with writing words on the board than explaining the concept. Prof Shi doesn't help prepare his students for the exam. The class average for exams is way below the average of other classes. He's a nice guy, but as a professor I would not recommend him. | Hes obviously posting fake reviews on here. One recommended him but added not for anyone new to Calculus. It was an introductory Calculus course! I took Calculus in high school and still did bad. Gave way too many assignments on MyMathLab (mostly because he didnt pay attention). Attending lectures was bothersome. Hope he gets his act together. | Honestly great professor. Class really is an easy A if you just show up to lectures and pay attention. Shi teaches w/ expertise and makes sure all students leave class w/ new calculus knowledge. People leaving bad ratings, either didn't study, or didn't show up 2 class. Plus he will randomly give u 2-3 min breaks in class when his wifi cuts out. | The majority of the class is failing.... put that into perspective... cool guy but very poor teaching style. | I have emailed this professor possibly 6 times this semester and only got a response back once. The level of difficulty of the lectures do not compare with that of the exams. Very nice guy and tries his best- but simply just isn't trained enough for this field. He doesn't assign too much hw but even the hw doesn't correspond with the exam questions | All the ""good"" reviews here are from Shi himself or from sympathetic students who wrote after Shi cried during office hours due to all the negative remarks. Even though he's nice, he is not a good professor and it is best to switch to someone else if you get him. He is a caring person nonetheless. | Taking this class with Shi made me wish I wasn't born | I am interesting that how so many positive reviews were updated on a single day Dec, 10, 2020. These are very wrong and not true compared to the truth. All my friends who took Shi's course are suffering. Shi was probably manipulating the records on RMP himself, very sad person, cannot teach, cannot accept the truth and keep cheating all the time. | Dont be fooled by all the good reviews, it is just out of sympathy for the real reviews. If you want to do well and pass Calc 151, please take a different Professor. Although he is a nice professor and tries, its simply not up to the mark. The lectures dont materialize to the real midterm so it is useless to even attend. Take someone else. | Good professor. However, I wouldn't recommend him to anyone who is new to calculus | Honestly, he isn't a bad teacher. He cares for his students and their grades. As of typing this, we are in quarantine and it was his first time teaching, and everyone leaving bad reviews because of this fact. Learning online is not good for everyone especially for calculus. Overall I think he is a good teacher but he can definitely improve though. | Here's my take: PLEASE don't look at Professor Shi poorly just because of the negative reviews. Personally, I think he's a GREAT professor when it comes to teaching you the concepts. He puts effort to make sure you understand them. The quizzes were definitely hard, I kept getting below the average but he's by no means a horrible professor. | Great teacher, enjoyed being in his class. While he is newer than other math teachers, his class was helpful for learning the material and he was always available for help when needed. | He is a decent professor, although, if you have no experience with calculus, wouldn't recommend him. | Professor Shi might have a lack of communication skills, but he is very helpful and cares about student's grades | Professor Shi is great. He made me fall in love with calculus and I would definitely take him next semester if he teaches calculus-2. | Great professor, the homework is manageable and the lectures are pretty good as well. Professor shi is really helpful and will definitely solve your doubts! | Oh my god do not take him you will regret it. His lectures have nothing to do with the tests granted that technically it's not his fault since the department writes the tests, but it ends up showing in your grades in the end of the day. 5 midterms + 1 final and its always 10x harder than what we're taught. You'll never feel prepared for tests w him | Great Professor. Very down to earth, always ready to help in any way possible, and cares about students and their grades. For those reading all the one rated comments, don't bother about them. They are from students who will fail this class. Trust me and take this professor. You will thank me later. And FYI: HE DOES NOT GIVE TOO MUCH HOMEOWRK!!! | Worst professor I have ever taken. I basically agree all reviews below. Besides all those reviews, I am doubting Shi's personality also. I was caught by (potential) COVID-19 and asked him for a help to extend the HW due. But he didn't reply and said no after 2 weeks. The people who hire him make a terrible decision, and do not take his class. | Not sure Shi himself understand Calculus himself. It seems he knows little and likes to talk something nonsense in his lecture. Terrible gap between lectures and HWs. Moreover, he does not reply emails at all and is not willing to help students. Terrible person, no respect to students. Shall avoid Shi with any costs. He is definitely disqualified! | The most useless professor I have ever taken. He knows nothing about how to teach and his reviews and lectures is nothing that prepares you for the exams which are very difficult. Please avoid him at all costs if you want to have a good grade. If I could give him a 0/5 I would because he is terrible. He wastes so much class time as well rambling. | He knows his stuff but sucks at explaining it to you. For Calc he is not someone I would reccomend especially of this is your first time taking Calc. | By the way whoever is reading this in the future. This is his ""first time teaching"" in 2020 Fall, recently graduated. He knows the topic but he's horrible at explaining it to you. Doesn't know how to really answer your question. However he does have things out of his control. He does not make his tests that is done by the Department. Nice guy | He doesn't explain anything clearly and just rants for the whole class thinking everyone understands. Also, the problems for homework and exams have a huge difficulty gap. You're gonna need to watch youtube videos or something to undetstand what the hell is going on. | Does not respond to emails and does not explain anything clear. Just makes me more and more confused. | Had him for clac 151. His lessons had nothing to do with his homework. He cant teach properly. His classwork has nothing to do with the exam. You're better of looking at youtube videos instead of attending lectures. Pick anyone else besides shi | Terrible, do not take him. He does not know what he is doing at all and is completely clueless. His lectures and homework have nothing to do with the midterms. I don't know who hired him but whatever you do, do not take this class if you want to actually pass."
"Luo, Yanwen","Easy class as long as you pay attention. I was carried through Intro to Linear and still understood it to keep up. Class shares some topics with linear. Professor is good at teaching and gives textbook problem HW each week which is the primary source of studying. There are 3 quizzes, of which the first 2 are attendance quizzes and the last is easy | Very nice class. You only need to show up for quizzes (3 during the sem, he tells you in advance, and they are on the easiest topics) and exams. The professor is pretty funny and will always have a great review session and announcement before exams. You will know exactly what to expect in terms of content and the number of questions. Hw is easy too | One of the best professors I have had. Super easygoing, laid back, and funny. Made sure every single concept was fully understood by the whole class and was very clear on what would be on each exam and quiz. Also gave a great curve at the end. Definitely recommend him! | Yanwen is very energetic when teaching the course. What you see in the lecture is what you can expect on the exam. The entire course only revolves around 3-5 different types of problems, so Yanwen takes his time and thoroughly teaches the material. Overall, an excellent instructor to have. | Yanwen is one of the best lecturers I have had at Rutgers. I would leave class having complete understanding of the material. My problem was my grade does not mirror my confidence because he was an extremely harsh grader. Whether it be homeworks or exams, I found it difficult to achieve high grades consistently. | Had Professor Luo for both Graph Theory and Linear Optimization. He's a personable guy with a sense of humor and his exams are pretty close to the textbook problems given- no surprises or tricks. Sometimes the material gets difficult, but he was always accommodating and always took time to answer every question | Prof Yanwen is incredible. He always explained details to make you understand the concepts well. He is very patient and nice. He also graded very fast. | He's a little weird but quite a nice guy. This class takes effort but he is not making it more difficult. Lectures might be unclear in structures sometimes and his handwritings are not so friendly so pay extra attention to what he's saying. Homeworks take time, this is not an easy class but this guy tries his best to help you. | Great guy, probably the nicest instructor Ive had. The material was tough but he did everything he could to help make it easier. Homework assignments were long and difficult but they certainly helped. Exams were difficult, especially toward the end of the course, but there was a rather generous curve. He is always willing to help out if needed. | Professor Luo is incredible! Advanced Calculus does contain a lengthy problem set that can be extremely challenging for those who do not have the best foundation in differential equations (like me), but professor will go out of his way to explain everything, especially in his office hours. Very empathetic and has great review sessions before exams! | Amazing math professor! He definitely knows how to teach. Exams are straightforward. Take him if you can."
"Lutsko, Christopher","This professor is so boring and monotonous. He is so uninterested with his job and always complains about the students' camera being off. The worst at explaining things and at office hours, it's even worse than I could ever magine. PLEASE AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS. HE GRADES TERRIBLY AND IS TOUGH. | his lectures are boring and blunt. his in-class problems are much easier than the hw, so hw takes a while to do. the exams are easier than the hw tho. his office hours are helpful and he's approachable. he repeats explanations if you ask and rarely gets mad. imo he could explain concepts better. nice person but a mediocre professor at best. | Professor Lutsko was an amazing professor. He was always willing to help during office hours or for appointments, and despite how hard Calc 2 was, he made it really understandable and made the class enjoyable. | Professor Lutsko is the best professor I had this semester. He always explains concepts thoroughly and if you ever don't understand a concept, he never hesitates to explain it again. Tests were not too bad, the homework questions were definitely harder than the questions on the exams. Attend his review sessions cuz he gives good review problems. | Dr. Lutsko does a wonderful job explaining the complex concepts in the course and I've never had a single bad experience in his lectures. He is a great guy in general that wants to make sure you know your stuff before you leave his class. | Professor Lutsko may be new to Rutgers, but he teaches one of the best math courses I have taken here. His lectures are very explanatory, and he is accessible outside of class time for help. Very understanding, and willing to help students work through issues in the course."
"Smilansky, Yotam","Best professor I have ever taken at Rutgers. Such a shame he had to move to another school, Rutgers really lost a gem of a professor. He made Calculus very easy to understand and made sure his students understood his lectures. Also, he is approachable, easy to talk to, and hilarious during class. | Great lecturer, Calc is hard but he made it digestible. Too bad he has to follow the coordinator's exams and rubric | Great teacher easy to understand. | Genuinely the best professor I have had at Rutgers and probably the best teacher I ever had. Professor Smilansky cares about his students a lot and gives incredible lectures with really good notes. He explains in a non-complex way that an outsider can understand the point he tries to make. He is also very funny. Don't listen to the 1-star reviews. | Prof Smilansky is super witty and very organized. He goes thru each step of the problem and answers questions clearly. He is super nice and understanding with extensions on homework and makeup exams too. He's a great guy take him if u can | Amazing. Take him! | I was afraid coming into Rutgers math, especially hearing about the nightmares of Calculus. However, Dr. Smilansky ended up making it quite enjoyable! Hilarious guy who cracks jokes at times. His lectures are organized and clear. He gives his all to answer any questions during lectures and genuinely seems to care for his students. Recommend!!! | Prof Smilansky was very organized with his notes and his lectures were easy to follow. He thoroughly explained all the examples and reviewed anything that was asked. I think he made calc as enjoyable as possible and would def take another class with him. Very helpful and cares about his students doing well. He is quite funny too. | Very strict with the calc guidelines but overall a chill professor and was funny sometimes. His lectures are easy to follow and goes over the content very well. During the semester he saw that students were struggling and helped as best as he could. | I had Professor Smilansky for Math 135 (Calc 1). Calc was definitely one of the most difficult courses I've taken at Rutgers, but Professor Smilansky is a great professor and his lectures and notes are organized. His explanations are clear and easy to follow and he cares about helping us understand the concepts, which can get pretty difficult. | His lectures are very easy to follow and his notes are some of the best I've ever seen, making 477 super digestible. The homework and exams are also pretty straightforward. However, although its a relatively easy A, you will not be prepared for the rigor of 481 if you have him for 477! Also, the final was worth 50% of the grade which is never fun. | Very great guy, definitely take him but give this course a second thought. 477 is not an easy class but he makes it much better. Homework takes lots of effort so be sure to know the material. He uploads everything and the slides are very clear, go to the TA office hours if you have any questions about the homework. So be prepared! | He's one of the best professors I've had at Rutgers so far! His lectures are interesting and engaging! He really knows how to teach, especially online. He genuinely cares about his students. I asked him questions over email not exactly related to the material and yet he was always happy to help! His notes are amazing, neat, useful and fun! | He made the class as easy as it could have been given the online format and difficulty of the material. His notes are absurdly neat and easy to parse, so I never opened the textbook. There were 4 midterms which was a bit much (idk if that was the math dept's orders though), but exams were open note and easier than the hw so doing well was feasible. | His notes are the neatest Ive ever seen for a professor at Rutgers. Posts everything online from lectures to his notes to homework/exam solutions. I was violently sick for one exam and he was so understanding. Great guy as well as prof. For context my exam grades were 75 so Im not even saying this because Ive done amazing, hes just great | As a new professor, I believe he is the guy to take it with. From being accessible out of class, to having all of the class resources accessible online, he wants you to succeed. He does his best to make sure to clarify complex topics, and his exams are somewhat straightforward, provided you do the hw. Overall phenomenal job for an online class! | He is very organized and caring. However, he is not experienced in teaching and you may find it difficult to digest some topics in the course. There are 4 midterms required by the math department, which is literally crazy. The weekly assignment is time consuming. Overall, he is really professional but not effective in teaching as I expected. | This class did really well online, the lecture notes were really good. The homework is a lot though, and does take a considerable time out of the week. Towards the end the material starts to pick up and get more difficult, but overall it was a great class! | He would throw formulas and theorems on your face without much explanation about why you need them. The topics covered in this course are like islands without being connected organically in a ""knowledge map"". Given a problem, you may not know which formula you should use because you did not learn the rationales underlying those theorems. | I hope Professor Smilansky would get out of the teaching business and save all of his future students from the endless misery and frustration his teaching will cause them. Taking this course made me realize that a PhD degree has little to do with effective lecturing. His class is the single most frustrating class I have ever taken at Rutgers. | 5 exams in one semester is kind of ridiculous for a high level math class. On top of having homework every week, it gets to be a bit much. The material is not totally easy either. He is a great lecturer, I just think the workload needs to be lessened. | This man is amazing. He's a very good teacher and very understanding. He CAN teach online and I would highly recommend him. His tests are fair, and he is really trying to help you get a good grade, knowing online tests are hard. The hardest problems you will ever get will be on your HW, but he mostly grades it on completion then right of wornge. | Had him for 477, material starts off easy but then ramps up near the end of the semester. We transitioned online halfway through and HW was dropped, but HW was fair and important to do. Exams are generally similar to HW/textbook problems, nothing tricky. Helpful dude and wants everyone to pass, will help you. | Hes new at rutgers and to this class. After scoring the high on calc 1-3 (above 97% in finals) I felt this class would be manageable given prev. Scores. Be prepared to get swong over in difficulty if youve never done probability before. He expects you to be able to permutations and combinations (counting) before coming to this class. Good guy tho"
"Dunkelman, Jodi","The dunks was awful. Avoid | Loved taking this class with Professor Dunkelman. I did not want to take this class but she made it much more bearable. I went early to ask her questions almost every class, she gave me feedback and made sure I understood the material. She makes the class easy and more enjoyable. | Professor Dunkelman is the best math teacher at Rutgers. She is such a sweetheart she explained algebra better than my high school teachers. But there is a lot hw (which boosts your grade) and quizzes are every week. Overall enjoyed her class! | Very good at explaining math questions and taking things slow. She cares a lot about her students and is very chill and funny. One of the greatest math teachers I've had!!"
"Woodbury, Michael","bro if you want to pass linear algebra or any math course, do not take him | I took calc 1, and This professor is caring. He explains concepts using handwritten notes (I was getting used to it), exercises, and some videos (not help with exams for me). u can't get good grades only depends on the lectures; it is important to use the DRG website and complete Pearson homework. He is kind and patient; ask him if u need him. | I took him for Calc 1 (Math 135). This was my first Calc class I ever took. Result? Worst math class I ever been through. Midterms were difficult. Final was worse. My TA was subpar. He teaches like you already know Calculus. His lectures leave newer students to Calculus in the dust. I had to use ChatGPT and videos to carry me through. Buckle up! | Took Calc 135. Nice guy but he often rambles during lecture about the philosophy behind the math instead of the actual math. If you go to lecture, you get a baseline of what to do but really only understand it in recitation. Good recitation professor is the best way to ace this class with minimal outside work. | Took Calc135 with Woodbury. His lectures were honestly so useless; 95% stopped attending by the end of the semester. I thought the reviews exaggerated and decided to give him a chance (big mistake). The class itself was a bit challenging so stay on top of the material or u will fall behind real quick. | CALC1! kind guy but horrible at teaching and responding to questions. One lecture doesnt cover the full topic that supposed to be covered in one class period. Lectures are disorganized, uses redundant videos and book to ""support learning"". My preformance was non passing until I stopped going to lecture and taught myself. Please dont take him. | he is a very smart man but an extremely terrible professor :( | I took calc 1 with him and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. He teaches the class like you've taken multiple calc classes before, rambles, and doesn't explain any topics well at all never actually explains the steps to a problem. Checking his rating while he was at Columbia desccribes him as a professor perfectly. | Not enough space here to write review. Please see the only post by u/DoNotTakeThisClass on Reddit. | His teaching is mediocre, but his tests are brutal. Instead of assessing knowledge, they focus on correctly carrying out hundreds of arithmetic operations by hand, leaving no time for review or figuring things out. I've never seen anyone finish early. | Terrible Professor. I've taken many math classes at Rutgers, some conceptually harder, yet I've never hated a class more than I do this one. He grades homework on correctness. His lectures are unorganized, and notes are difficult to follow, yet he takes points off of HW for not formatting your steps in a particular manner. Not understanding at all. | Horrendous. One of the worst teachers I've ever had, if not the worst. Don't get me wrong, he's a very nice guy but he is terrible at his job. I took a calc class yet he decided to include a lot of computer applications, assigned more homework than any class I've ever had, and made life miserable. It will also take months for him to grade anything."
"Grillo, Corey","Such a sweet guy. Really took his class for granted but he made sure all of us tried our best. He constantly answered questions anyone had and went over any specific problems when we asked. Hands down the best math professor | Lectures were very good and made homework easy. | I came into Calculus 135 not having a strong foundation (did not take AP in high school). However, Professor Stone is very clear when he explains the material. He goes at a good pace and will go over anything the students request. He is super kind and very understanding. Favorite professor at Rutgers so far. Highly recommend him for Calculus 135! | Prof Stone is a great lecturer and always willing to offer help. He does not make you feel stupid and is super patient with annoying classmates. He explains things pretty well. If you get him for calc, you are super lucky. | Amazing prof. definitely my all time fav math prof from ru. he's so kind and he answers every question respectfully- no matter how dumb. even his exams are pretty easy. although, he teaches through a notebook projected onto the screen and handwrites notes (posts them after each lecture tho) so that could be a little downside if you sit far away | Prof. Stone was great for Calc 2! He explains concepts clearly and is very approachable for questions. Some conceptual exam questions are a little challenging, but if you prepare with the review materials, past exams, and homework, you should do well. The recitation quizzes are not bad and similar to problems from class. | I took Calculus 152H (the honors section) with Professor Stone. He was a wonderful Professor, patiently explained every concept, was knowledgeable about questions beyond the syllabus also, and was available outside of class if we had any questions. Would highly recommend him. | Had him for calc 135 and loved him!! Went slow and did a great job of making sure we understood the topics. Class gave a lot of homework assignments, but that is understandable for a math class. Would highly recommend him to anyone taking calc! | This professor was very kind and patient with our class this semester. He explained this clearly and multiple times if anyone didn't understand. I would honestly recommend taking his class. | This class (MATH 152 - Calculus 2) was kind of annoying and a lot of work. I feel like I did not really gain anything from the lectures, but they were not bad. As long as you put in the work you can do well in the class."
"Jabbari, Mohammad","class only consists of practice examples (that we can barely read). concepts are explained very vaguely, and he does not make it clear the information we need to know on our exams. during lectures, he was also quite rude to students at times when he would randomly call on them. | Lectures were only practicing examples. If you haven't already taken calc you will be lost. He does not actually teach anything just shows example problems."
"Volpe, Tyler","Best recitation professor I've ever had. I've had him as a professor twice now and always recommend him to my friends. He cares so much about his students and will go out of his way to ensure you understand the material no matter how much you struggle. He is one of the reasons why I didn't drop Calc. | He helped me sooo much in Calc 1 (135). He was my recitation teacher and was 10x more helpful than my professor. I learned so easily from him and he did a great job explaining. He truly cares; you just have to ask questions. He's also very funny and easy to approach. As someone with anxiety, it was so easy to talk to him. Great guy. | Only so much a recitation teacher can do, but Tyler definitely helped me get an A in calc 135. He is EXTREMELY accessible. He grades quizzes fairly and does a better job teaching content than the professors. He is also a great guy and easy to talk to, but is a great tool to use and dedicates his time to his students! Reach out! | Tyler was my Calc 135 recitation prof. He was the absolute best. He is the only way I was able to get an A in this class. He explains calculus very clearly and tries to fully understand the question you are asking before answering. He is also the nicest guy and will try to answer any questions you have. Definitely take Tyler. | I took Professor Volpe in my spring semester of '23 6, he is an excellent teacher and probably one of the best I've had so far. He provides plenty of practice problem worksheets as well as records his lectures if you do miss need to rewatch a problem. He's clear about the mistakes you make on problems also. Super chill guy, PLEASE TAKE HIM!! | Had him as a recitation professor, great guy, super receptive to student's questions. Accessible out of class and had really helpful recitation notes to study from. | Super nice!!! Great recitation instructor. I got amazing feedback on my quizzes. He also answers your questions."
"Ellis, Paul","He's an eh lecturer. He is not very good at explaining concepts and explaining these topics in a manner as we should already know what he is talking about. His recitation quizzes are also extremely hard. He can also come off as rude at times and isn't very helpful. Edit: I lowered my rating after taking good professors, just don't take him at all. | Professor Ellis is, in my years of schooling, probably one of the worst teachers I have ever encountered. He does not take much time to explain the curriculum and he expects you to know most, if not all of it. His personality also comes across as rude and passive-aggressive which is distasteful for a learning environment. Please try someone else! | - | Professor Ellis is one of the better math professors at Rutgers. He is a really good teacher but calculus itself can be challenging regardless of your professor. He is not too fast and color coded problems and also posted the notes which made it easier to practice outside of class. Also, his reviews before each midterm and final were very helpful. | Professor Ellis is a good professor for calc. He made sure his students were understanding the topic and he would repeat whatever you did not understand again. He would ""baby"" the steps for you so you would understand it which I appreciated. Sometimes he would get rude and be mean but other than that he is a nice professor. | Professor Ellis is not someone who you want to be learning Calculus from. His lectures are confusing as it ,and examples in lecture do not reflect problems on the exam. The exams are crazy confusing and complicated, so literally choose anyone else for Calc. | Ellis Paul was a great math Calc 135 professor! He teaches at a slow pace; however, it helped me understand the content better than when I took Dr. G's first semester. Participating in class will help you understand the material, practice with Dr.G's worksheets, and DO NOT wait until the last minute to start studying for exams. | He was an alright lecturer, nothing special. As long as you actually attended class and did the homework diligently, you should be fine. However, fair warning, the course is very homework and test-heavy. Make sure that you prepare for your recitation. I tried winging them one too many times, and it didn't end up well. | His lectures were not engaging at all. He would get mad at his students for showing up a couple of minutes late. His class examples were extremely simple compared to the actual exams so they weren't helpful. Exams were really really hard and he offered no insight on what to use to prepare or what topics to focus on. | Very rude professor who does not teach any content that he puts on the exams. Compared to every other professor teaching the same class, he makes his tests exceptionally harder and unfair. Would not recommend for Calculus 151. | He is one of the best Math Professors I have seen; he explains very well, but in the end, you will need to buckle up and go over assignments and examples, as the class examples are much easier than the workshops and the exam ones. I have emailed him a thousand times regarding small questions and always got a reply in one day. | Knows the material very well, but a little robotic. You'll more likely than not do horribly in the class but it's okay because it's curved which will add like 20 points to your grade. Highly recommend. | Buddy pops tf off during lecture by doing his own thang. In all seriousness, Paul thoroughly knows the material he is teaching. He throws some questionable jokes around that never seem to reach the audience. He needs to understand that this isn't a stand up show and is in fact calc. He is pretty good but there is most certainly room for improvement"
"Cheng, Chiahui",Avoid Professor Gao at all costs. Very nice lady but does not know how to teach.
"Mavrogiannis, Georgios","Honestly, my favorite professor I've had. Will answer any questions asked effectively, but make sure you ask questions. | He's very smart and a very good teacher. Will make sure to answer any question you have and explains things very well. Overall just a rly good teacher | I previously rated him 2/5 but now give 5/5. Despite his busy postdoc schedule (research and teaching), he teaches well and has deep math knowledge. He's a math expert for sure. He's been especially helpful recently, and, honestly, he's kind of good-looking. If Dr. G weren't the math coordinator, I think Prof. M could teach us Calc 1 even better. | Great Professor with very interactive lectures. In order to receive a good grade in Calc 1 a lot of self studying has to be done. However, the professor makes the course easier by making sure to answer any question you have and will teach it in a way that makes you actually understand the lesson. | Great lectures, instructive examples and very inspired and motivated proofs. Grading also very fair. As long as it's evident you like the material and care, he'll really work to help your grade. Very accessible out of class as well, quick emails and regular, illustrative office hours."
"Ma, Zilu","He posts his lecture notes online but go to class or it won't make much sense. Tests are super easy if you pay attention, almost a replica of the review session (class before test). No proofs, just basic problem solving. Took Matlab section, so homework was relatively easy. Lectures are okay, might have to review concepts on your own time. | Professor Ma in Math 250 was one of my favorite teachers solely because of the way he taught. He speaks at a decently fast speed, which I appreciate. He answers every question, even if it is really dumb, with full effort and will try his best to understand what you mean. He doesn't do group/in-class work, he just gets through the curriculum. | chill guy i fw him | One of my favorite classes so far! Professor Ma is very nice and kind. His lectures are well-organized, making mathematical concepts easy to understand. He really cares about our students and is always willing to help. In office hours, he sparked my interest in mathematics and deepened my passion for the subject. My favorite prof ever! Recommend :) | Ma is an excellent professor who has the patience and teaching skills you need to succeed. If you are interested in any field of mathematics you'll love taking Linear Algebra with him. Make sure to take quality notes as it will go a long way! (also if you're CS major I recommend taking Discrete I & Physics I alongside this course. Lot of overlap. | Clearly very knowledgeable. Answers every question concisely, even the stupid ones. Smart, soft-spoken, and nice. | He has organized and simple lectures, and he posts the lecture notes. He provides practice problems and review sessions for exams which are very helpful. Exams and quizzes are very fair with preparation, and a reasonable amount of HW. Going to lectures is pretty important and helpful but not mandatory. Overall he is a good professor. | The lectures are really important to understanding the class, but Ma's teaching style felt advanced yet understandable at the same time. There is homework once a week, he posts his annotated lectures notes, and the exams were similar to the homework and example problems we did in class. He now uses a mic so it's easier to hear him too. | This class is really tough if you cram everything in the last minute, so be prepared to put a LOT of work in this class. The professor posts a recording of his lecture, which is nice, however the only issue is that he grades the midterms and finals very hard. | I took Linear Algebra Spring 2023. You will have to do the work for this class. There is literally no way around it. Sit in the front of the class for lectures since he is pretty quite. Definitely do the homework and MOST DEFINITELY take advantage of office hours if you don't get something. Don't wait till the last minute like I did. | He is a great professor overall, his teaching style is pretty advanced, but the midterms and final was pretty fair. He also replies quickly and is easily accessible."
"Kontorovich, Alex","The most humble, knowledgeable, and kind professor I could have ever asked for. As long as you show up to class and communicate with him when there is something wrong, you will get a good grade. He is also extremely knowledgable in what he teaches, and knows everything inside and out, even the history of its invention. | - VERY knowledgeable; knows everything inside & out - friendly, easy to talk to, relatable - accessible outside class/after class - records lectures & posts online - moves quickly; if you fulfilled prerequisites thoroughly you'll be fine - likes participation - answers questions really well - attendance mandatory, but doesn't check | goated | Notes are soooo confusing and tough to follow, doesn't explain clearly. Avoid at all costs!! | CANNOT TEACH! Maybe a nice guy but his notes are worthless, exams are crazy hard, much harder than practice problems and the guy is absolutely arrogant!!!! | He is by far the best teacher I have ever had so far in my life. He keeps everyone engaged and tries to make lectures interesting. His midterms are very similar to the review sheets and have an extremely similar style of questions to the final exam for the course. A lot of homework, but he truly cares that everyone does well. Show up to lecture. | Prof. Kontorovich is a really good professor. I actually had him for Calc 151, not 135 but he's still good. His lectures are a little confusing, I will admit, but his midterms are so similar to the review sheet so with practice it's not difficult to do well. He really cares about his students and always urges us to ask questions. DA BEST | I switched professors since his notes and handwriting were so unorganized. He's a nice guy but the lectures are unorganized and hard to follow. An unreasonable amount of homework and not enough time to complete them, I heard from every other student with a different math professor but same class say they had plenty of time to complete the homework. | It was much easier than I expected. I didn't like the professor's style. I found his notes to be poorly organized. He's a nice guy though. | Professor Kontorovich clearly puts thought and effort into his teaching. He is always looking to help every student succeed. He conveys material clearly without disregarding its complexity and real life application. The grade I received was the grade I worked for. One of the best educators I've ever had. | An extremely intelligent, caring, and humble professor who treats you with respect and has the best explanations for everything. Just by the way he speaks and presents the material, you can tell he wants everyone to succeed. He is one of the rare professors who cares about pedagogy along with doing research. Best professor I've ever had. | He is the best professor. Calc is a hard class but if you attend his lectures, pay attention, do the homework, and go to office hours to ask questions, you should do okay. Kontorovich cares a lot and tries hard to make sure everyone understands. | Honestly I loved Professor Kontorovich so much. He honestly cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. I do admit the webassign is very hard (not his fault) & his exams are harder than the final but it's because he wants to prepare his students. If you put hard work into this class you'll be fine. Sit close & tell him when ur confused | WebAssign is the worst thing ever I hate doing math hw online. Show up to lectures it helps even though he moves quickly. If you're struggling in the beginning of this class get help right away. DO the book problems and go to office hours. | Lectures are great, he's very personable and funny. He highlights important concepts in lecture and goes over examples. He is very receptive to student opinion. If you pay attention in lecture and have a decent understanding of the WebAssigns you should be fine. | He is a good Prof. Very engaging and honestly one of the best Math profs ive had. Hes a genius and hes really cool. His class demands a lot of HW and he will make you work for a good grade but hes easier than most of the other Profs for Calc135. Take him you will learn a lot. | Do not recommend. Exams are hard. His lectures confuse. He has no organization. | Professor K was my hardest professor last semester. He made his exams purposefully challenging in hopes of making the final seem easier to us in the end (I didn't feel it worked). He focused a lot on the concepts behind the problems, not solely on how to do them. I honestly felt he was too intelligent to be teaching such a basic calculus course. | He does care for his students but he's definitely one of the tougher professors, especially for intro calculus. If I hadn't took calculus in high school, I probably would have failed this class. The class' only saving grace is that he curves the exams and gives tons of credit for homework. His exams are insanely tough, so prepare to study hard. | He is a great guy and cares/interacts w his students. But he isn't a great lecturer. He can make easy concepts more confusing and his tests are extremely difficult. He advised us to do past tests as practice and that made me feel pretty confident bc I thought they were easy. The actual exams were much more difficult which made me very discouraged. | He is a very tricky and confusing professor. His exams are more difficult than those of other calc professors. He will suggest that you do the practice exams from the school's math site, but will then give an exam that is much more difficult than the practice exams (which are exams from previous years). My effort was not reflected in my grade. | He's a really nice guy who obviously cares about his students but is really not the best teacher. His lectures are very scrambled and often times hard to follow, and his exams are the hardest of all of the calc 135 classes. | He's a great guy & really wants the best for his students. Its my fault for barely passing his class, I think if I had attended office hours and sat in the front row, I would have done better. I am an awful test taker, so I do not recommend taking his class. Overall, just be prepared to teach yourself. Welcome to RU | Kontorovich's class was ok. Very nice guy, but he is not the best teacher. He is really confusing when explaining calculus so you need to teach yourself some sections in order to pass. He means well though, and he is usually available for extra help. | He's very caring and wants everyone to pass, but do not take him for lower level math classes because he goes VERY fast. You will have to set aside a lot of time to teach yourself if you cannot keep up. His quizzes/tests are also harder compared to other calc classes. | Kontorovich is an excellent professor. It's not an easy class and there's a whole lot of material, but with Dr. K, if you show up, ask questions, and clarify what you know, you can do well. He genuinely wanted everyone to do well. His office hours are great. His review sessions: prepare by bringing your own questions as he won't. | This is not an easy class but Professor Kontorovich make the class interesting. He does care about all of his students. It can be difficult to follow his lectures sometimes, but he's nice and answer questions patiently. | As someone who is not a Math major, taking Math 300 was scary. Professor Kontorovich actually cares about his students, and wants to see them do well in his class. His lectures were very helpful, and I would go as far as saying attending lectures for this class in essential to doing well."
"Zhou, Zehui","She goes through lectures very quickly and if you do not show up you will do bad. However a lot of the test is from the lecture worksheets so lock in. She isnt a horrible teacher, but she is definitely not the best. She kinda just like says stuff and is very robotic. BAD at answering questions | The professor knows what she is talking about and the TA is really helpful for answering questions. I went to lectures, but they were not super beneficial because the slides were definition heavy and the notes were posted anyway. Problems on tests were predictable but the proofs were scary. | she had great notes, and her teaching materials were super organized and easy to follow. I just wish we had more practice problems during class. | Prof. Zehui speaks extremely softly, into an extremely sensitive microphone, which made it difficult to understand her. Her lectures are, quite literally, by the book; around October, I stopped attending class entirely because I realized I could teach myself. She's a nice person, believe me, but I don't feel like I enjoyed this class. | The lectures are not very interesting, and she follows the textbook exactly, so there's not really any extra info you get from attending. The lectures were boring, but she is really nice and accommodating. Because she follows the book, she goes pretty fast so make sure to do practice outside of class. | Differential Equations- lectures were not very helpful, better off just going to TA. Terrible grader- takes off random points for every tiny thing on exams. Gave no curve (90 and above was an A). I was 0.88% away from an A and she wouldn't reconsider giving any points back on the final exam to bump me up. needed 4 points back on the final for the A | Great prof.Has a noticeable accent so it's hard to understand sometimes but she makes sure everybody has what they need to pass. 100% recommend you go to the TA review sessions because I kid u not she tells them to go over certain questions. ""CERTAIN QUESTIONS"" if ya know what I mean. Don't miss them. I only did bad cause I had harder classes. | Very caring and knows the material well. It is a bit hard to understand her during lectures, but she does her best to explain the material to the students. Her office hours are really good to attend before exams because she lets you know which specific problems to review for the exam and she is accurate with what information will be on the exam. | Decent lecturer. What makes her class great is how HEAVILY you are rewarded for going to the TA's review session before each exam. She tells them to go over ""certain problems"" (if yk what I mean) and it's quite impossible not to get an A if you understand how to do them. Should be an easy A if you do that and stay on top of the HWs and quizzes. | She has a noticeable accent, making it challenging to comprehend at times. Despite this, she's kind and helpful; and openly clarifies exam queries via email. All notes and worksheets are available on Canvas, eliminating the need for attendance. Extra credit opportunities exist, but two midterms and a final. Warning, she puts one proof on the exams! | not a good lecturer | Hard to understand but average tbh"
"Soria Carro, Maria","Best math teacher I've had. Makes the class very doable as long as you do the homework and study. | Solid professor. Calc 5 is a tough class but she makes it manageable. She provides a lot of extra resources for students to study and she uploads her notes online after lecture. HW can get very lengthy and difficult but the bottom line is, as long as you put in the work and pay attention in lecture, you will definitely pass the class."
"Sun, Hongbin","Excellent algebraic topology lectures. Explains all the details that are handwaved in Hatcher's book. | He was a good lecturer but often hard to understand. His notes are really clear and he always posts them to Canvas - super helpful! Grading wise TA's gives partial credit and work to help. Workshops are helpful, overall not bad for calc2. | I felt professor Sun prepared me very well for the exams, and that his lectures were always organized and relevant. Sometimes he would lean a bit too far into the proofs, and he wasn't always the best at answering students' questions during lectures, but overall he teaches the material well, and he's quite lenient when it comes to exam makeups. | Excellent teacher! You do not even have to take notes for the lectures, he will write down the notes clearly and submit them to canvas for you. EZ A. | His teaching methods were effective, focusing on application and examples. On top of that, he was a caring empathetic professor who could cater to any student. Although his tests are filled with long, tough computations, he prepares you well for them (and lets you have a formula sheet)!"
"Calderoni, Filippo",Great teacher! Writing proofs can be difficult but he helps you navigate through example and how to approach it. He's always willing to help out. There's an assignment about every week except on weeks when a midterm is scheduled.
"Dul, Filip","He's a good professor. Explained linear algebra in a good way and there was weekly homework that wasn't too bad. He also has a great sense of humor so lecture is never that boring. I would highly recommend taking him. | Overall great professor. Class is not too difficult and the weekly homework is moderate. Exams are not bad as long as you read the textbook and do the homework. Greate sense of humour as well. Highly recommend. Never a dull moment. | Professor Dul explained things excellently. Intro To Linear Algebra does require you to train yourself to think a little differently in comparison to the Calculus sequence. Professor Dul made the transition easy, was very accessible outside of class, and his exams were easy provided you participated and read the textbook. Would highly recommend."
"Han, Zheng-Chao","Nice person, but he cannot lecture. He was always behind schedule and makes the practice exams very easy while the actual exams are nothing like the practice ones. Had to self-teach the entire class. He also did not tell us how final grades were calculated. | This class (multi honors) was pretty rough. Going to lectures will not help you unless you have a 70% hold on the content covered BEFORE. 2-3 problem sets per week plus reading will make this class your whole life for the semester. Quizzes were difficult and he did not communicate well with the TA. Some students started going to Shtelen's instead | He's a very adjustable and fair professor. I did terrible on the first exam. The class is difficult in terms of the material covered. The first couple chapters of the textbook SUCK so it was hard for me to understand what was going on. He was very generous with grading and though his teaching style wasn't for me, he was still a very fair prof. | I bombed the first midterm and got a 50 but ended up with an A the final and midterm 2 were very easy. Gave good lectures that were helpful. only complaint are the quizzes for recitation moved quite fast and you would need to do the pre worksheet before every quiz to get a good grade but he took off two lowest quiz grades. | Nice guy, excellent lecturer, doesn't give up in trying to help students understand. Killer midterm 1 but midterm 2 and final exam had take-home portions. Teaches directly from textbook but makes confusing textbook make sense. Extremely generous with grades, allowing students to focus on learning. Looked forward to Mondays and Wednesdays. Love Han! | Professor Han is consistently behind schedule, usually taking half of the class to cover material from the previous class or two. His exams are extremely difficult despite the practice exams being easy, and the lectures aren't engaging. I've noticed that most people end up skipping. The curve is also really bad even though the scores are low. | DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!! unless you want to teach the entire course to yourself since his lectures make no sense. he's a nice guy and clearly knowledgeable however can't teach. plus this is a matlab section, lots of homework, lots of self-study. nobody was able to get over a 90 in the final. | The tests are absurdly difficult quite a few times. The subject (Linear Algebra) is already complicated, but he doesn't really make it less complicated. It includes a lot more theory and things to remember than I would like rather than actual math questions that require calculations. | Fantastic class! Professor Han was an incredible instructor for 412. His course notes are comprehensive and well-made. The course was very fair, with take-home portions on the exams to balance difficulty. In-class portions of the exams are very reasonable too! Also, very accessible and helpful through email/office hours if necessary. | I did not struggle at all this class. The people who struggled did not put in the work. All the harder concepts covered were not covered on exams. The people who compain about 291 would struggle in regular multi variable calc as well. The Lin alg was rushed but if you put in the work its fine. Very fair class. | A very nice man, but I can't learn well in his class. 291 is very fast-paced and a big jump from high school math. Han tried his best to make the class tolerable, and I am very thankful for that. Not a bad lecturer, but his soothing voice makes me lose focus easily. Personally, I learn more from doing the assignments and going to office hours. | Professor Han made 291 much easier than I expected. Exams were pretty straightforward. His notes that complement Carlen's notes were really useful. As long as you read a bit of his notes and Carlen's notes, it's pretty easy to stay on top of the course material. There's also a good amount of homework, but that's to be expected and is quite helpful. | I had Professor Han for math 291 and math 292. The class is meant to be difficult but Professor Han made it as easy as possible for the students. Lectures are hard to follow sometimes so always read the textbook before. Tests are really fair. The only thing I didn't like about the class was the amount of work given, which isn't his fault though. | Professor Han is a very nice man and very clearly cares a lot about his students. However, he is so knowledgable that it is difficult for those who aren't 100% following to understand which makes him hard to approach. Math 291 just has a terrible textbook as well, which is not his fault. | Hard Hard class, every lecture requires significant preparation, lectures are proof heavy, start challenge sets early and do lots of probs to prep for tests. Han is a kind hearted person who is patient with questions however dumb and values intuition above mechanical problem solving. Take advantage of every office hours and be PREPARED! Good luck! | Poor lecturer. Just wrote on the board and you can barely understand what was being written. Teaching style was not clear and you were better off just reading the textbook and practicing problems yourself. | Very dry, methodical method of teaching. Not the most exciting or easiest, but he's always willing to answer questions, which is very useful as I found the textbook a bit confusing. MATLABs are free points, but his quizzes are a bit tough. There is only a very small curve (4/5 points), so you do have to really put the work in to get a good grade. | He is very bad at teaching especially Linear Algebra. I really like math and have taken upto Calc 5. I took this class as an tech elective but it screwed me over. His lectures are very boring so no one comes to his lectures. And all he does is write theorems on the board. Does not explain properly. I would recommend to take some other Professor. | Class is counterintuitive, study the book because his lectures are actually useless and confusing. Not very good at teaching at all and online quizzes are hit or miss. Dont take him. | He's a very nice man and understands students' concerns about the class. His teaching style is very technical, which was hard for me to personally follow. He writes a lot on the board like a textbook and added an extra section into the syllabus for midterm 2. Other than that, tests were pretty fair. | Great professor and incited so much personal interest in geometry. Would take again in a heartbeat. | Hands down one of the best professor I've had at Rutgers. He knows his stuff and always writes what he is going to do next on the board. It may get boring sometimes but if you weren't paying attention you wont be lost. Good teacher. | This is not math anymore. I have no idea where these other comments came from all he does is vomit information on the board.The tests could be worse but the problems are stated in an entirely different way from the book. adv calc is horrible no matter what. | too tough on grading. my grade could have been a letter different if he was grading less tense. | very hard on grading. dont take him. | Single handedly the best math course I've ever taken here. Han was very helpful to me. Very managable class with interesting topics. My only gripe was that some of the homework problems didn't correlate with covered material, but other than that, this was a class that I know I can use as a high school teacher. I highly recommend Dr. Han. | His assignments and exams were not that easy but doable. However, if you're having trouble he is extremely helpful. Go to his office hours if you're struggling. Do the practice problems in the book for studying. They help. | he is great. very good professor, very smart, very nice, and helpful. tests were doable, grades fair. | SOO delicious to look at. I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, especially the last few. Zheng Chao always kept my interest and I found his homework and exams very managable. | I really liked taking Geometry with him. The topics that were covered were pretty interesting and the exams are pretty straightforward, no surprises. Definitely take geometry with him! | He's alright but he's way too verbose and his tests aren't that easy | i love this guy! =D | A very reasonable man."
"Krishnan, Gautam Gopal","Absolutely awful. Doesn't use canvas and takes notes from an old notebook onto the chalkboard. I highly don't recommend. He has a really strong accent, doesn't answer questions that well, and the quizzes have nothing to do with the material learned in class. The class material also doesn't go with what's on exams. | I believe it was his first year teaching and it was awful. After the midterm 1, he would show up late to class every time. His canvas page was barely set up and his notes were not related to the difficulty of the exams at all. Recitation was no help either with a bad TA. The material given to the TA wasn't related to the quizzes. Don't recommend."
"Saks, Michael","Please take 10 minutes to review this question. | Doesn't fully explain concepts in lectures | Horrible teacher and very arrogant, has a superiority complex since he is our professor had to change my lecture section cause of how this guy taught as he overcomplicated everything. | I think hes a great prof! I havent talked to him much but hes really nice and explains concepts clearly. However, u should understand the pces before going to class. He answers all questions and is always active on piazza | Worst prof at u of t, ruined first-year engineering. However, he is, unfortunately, the coordinator of MAT186, making the worst assignments and tests. Those are just terrible as they require you so unnecessary stupid math communication thing. We engineering don't need this, you better get back to artsci! It was a disaster! 188>186! | He was always helpful."
"Stewart, Gavin","Really nice guy. He does go off topic and he is a bit borning, but he is really into what he does. Not the most interesting version of the class, but the papers are easy enough, and you get good grades on them. The tests are confusing, but he curves at the end. Stick with it, you will be fine. Never get worried. | Much rougher than I imagined. Put off readings until just before exams, but they dominate exams (I don't remember half of what he lectured on and did fine). Had too vague of an idea of how I was doing (he gives minus grades, even though the university doesn't). Could have sworn I was getting a D, ended up with a B+. Extremely stressful. | i thought this class would be interesting, but it ended up being really boring. he goes off topic, mumbles, and spends the whole class talking about random tv shows that no one else watches. 2 papers and 2 exams. | Not only as boring as a brick wall,but what he speaks of is completely irrelevent to the topics we are supposed to be learning.I went into this class interested and excited, and was tortured. I did worse in this class than any other comm class I've had.Is like listening to an ancient relative of yours reminesce on life.Attendance counts too much. | worst professor i have had by far since i've been @ rutgers. goes off on tangents all the time during class, talks about things that seem utterly useless, and his exams are RIDICULOUSLY hard. definitely need to read as well as attend each class as attendance is a part of the grade. | Horrible teacher, doesn't know how to teach and is very unclear, extremely boring. NEVER take him he doesnt' know what he's doing | One of the best professors I had at Rutgers. Enthusiastic about his subject and helpful. This was a fun class. | I really expected this class to be a lot better then it was.Its very easy to do well and he really is trying to be a good teacher, but his idea of pop music is nothing like anything I ever heard before! I did like his grading system and paper topics were interesting, but I think the problem is people go into this class expecting too much. | gee, where should i start.Three papers,1 lousy final,and a presentation, way too much work considering he doesnt teach the class anything. spends min. 30 minutes every class going over admin. crap then keeps us 7 minutes late,plays ridiculous music noone likes,scribbles comments on paps.DO NOT TAKE"
"Thieme, Cameron","Absolutely lovely professor. Very fascinating professor who generates interest in topics and explains his readings in a relatable and easy manner. Read the syllabus closely, for my social philosophy class I was given the opportunity to substitute my final for a debate. 100% worth it to consider. | A lot of weekly reading but we go over it in class, as well as have a group discussion at the end. Participation will make this class more enjoyable, and because there are interesting topics it isn't boring. 2 tests are material heavy, full open ended, and a little bit stressful - but theres a curve. Just read up + take notes and you'll do fine. | Weekly readings from various philosophers; can be difficult to understand, but he explains the core topics in class discussions/handouts (essential). He places heavy emphasis on participation (40%), then two multiple-short-essay-question exams (30%) and one 1500 word paper (30%). Very kind and helpful to students. Must have decent writing skills."
"Chen, William","I really enjoyed this class. He treats us as though we are intellectuals entering the field of education which I really appreciated. He challenged us to think critically about important issues that we should really be conscious of. It was actually refreshing to take an education course like this. If you' re open to something new, you'll enjoy it. | I actually really enjoyed his class. Some students expect this class to be an easy elective but he really expects you to think about some abstract ideas that actually also really connect to practical experience. I thought this class was different than other education classes, so I enjoyed it! | Unclear expectations. Syllabus was 8 full pages of 1.5 spaced text. Class is boring and pointless. We often have to sit and read to ourselves. Tons of Readings and lengthy papers assigned with no clear goals or requirements, while the other section had no books to buy and shorter papers with clear goals and expectations. | So boring. some people loved it, some people hated it. found it totally useless and coming out of student teaching I really hoped to do something relevant. lots more work than other sections, all philosophy, nothing practical"
"Hejna, Agnieszka","You must show up to class and do homework frequently but I would absolutely recommend Pani Makles to anyone, at any level, looking to learn the Polish language! In one semester with little experience I was able to communicate fluently with others, write papers, and understand. Pani Makles is extremely kind and makes class fun! Definitely recommend!"
"Dimitrov, Stoyan","The professor is really caring about his students and will explain all concepts clearly. He provides opportunities for extra credit and the curve is generous as well. The only improvement I can see is to provide more practice problems. Everything else is really good. | Cares about the students. His lectures are good. If you attend them throughout the semester you can get a good grade. | Good professor with clear lectures and care for his students. I like his easy to use website with class resources and his grading scheme is very simple. There aren't many assigned homework problems, so I'd recommend doing some on your own for extra practice. The cutoffs for the class were also fairly generous. | Great professor. Very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. I learned a lot and will take another class with him if given the opportunity. | The lectures were well organized and easy to follow. Everything you need to succeed in this class is all on his website. | He is very calculated and precise in his explanations of many difficult concepts. I believe he breaks down info in a manner that makes the information much easier to digest. | The enthusiasm Professor Dimitrov has for combinatorics is really motivating. He simplifies difficult subjects into chunks so that students may follow along and have a grasp of the material. His readiness to respond to inquiries both within and outside of the classroom establishes a friendly, encouraging atmosphere that promotes development for all | ""Professor is kind, knowledgeable, and approachable. His clear lectures, structured assignments, and prompt responses make learning manageable, even in a challenging course. I truly appreciate his support and understanding, especially when students are struggling. Highly recommend this course!"" | Lectures were not mandatory but def helpful if you went to them. I wasn't a big fan of the textbook but it had useful practice problems. The homework assignments were interesting/engaging. We def covered more material than other sections of the course. He was very timely with email responses and was willing to stay after class if we had questions. | Professor is very chill and easy to talk to, makes the material easy to understand. Much of the class material is from the textbook and most of the exam problems were very similar to examples done in class. I definitely recommend others to take this course! | Professor Dimitrov does a great job of breaking down the key ideas of the class and the textbook in a clear and succinct way, which makes following along much easier. The class will require independent effort, make sure to take time to practice proofs on your own. If you put in the work outside of class, you'll do great. | Professor Dimitrov is knowledgeable and organized. The lectures are clear, and the course materials are well-structured. He is approachable and responds to emails quickly. However, the course can be challenging, and keeping up with the assignments and exams requires consistent effort. | Really great guy over all. Always accessible and generous on grading. | Professor Dimitrov's teaching is engaging and insightful, making complex Graph Theory concepts clear and approachable. His passion for the subject and organized style create a great learning environment. Could provide more practice problems for reinforcement, but overall, highly recommended! | 2 HW's (15% each), Midterm (30%) & Final (40%). Allows cheat sheet during both tests. Attendance not required and he only does examples from textbook. Ok-ish teaching skills, might have been me as graph theory is not a interesting subject. Decent curve to final letter A(87.5-100),B+(80.5-87.49)B(73.5-80.49),C+(67.5-73.49),C(60.5-67.49)F(below 46.5) | I am glad to have had Professor Dimitrov for Combinatorics. His lectures are clear, and he is always ready to help students learn by answering questions in class, after class, or during office hours. He explains challenging concepts well, provides nice resources for students to explore topics further, and creates a good class environment. | Honestly, this professor is one of the good ones at Rutgers! Everything you need to know for the class is in the textbook, with the Homework and Exams closely resembling the stuff in the textbook! Not only that, but attendance isn't mandatory, so if you cannot make it to the lectures, you can catch up with/ the textbook! The professor does curve! | Good prof, knows his stuff, presented the material clearly, though a little soft-spoken during lectures and we didn't end up covering all the planned topics. 3 HW assignments, 2 midterms and a final. | Professor Dimitrov is the greatest professor at Rutgers. He could teach Linear Algebra to a third grader and they would still end with an A. Looking back, I'm not sure there was even one thing I would change to make the lectures better. You will regret not signing up for his class for years if you don't take him. He's also very buff."
"Borisov, Lev","Very difficult. You will learn the material well, but you'll be under stress from the weekly quizzes and competitive grading, while not having graded HW. He is somewhat generous when grading quizzes/exams and everyone gets at least a B, which is nice, but it's still difficult and stressful. Definitely a great lecturer, though. | Brutal. The tests have qual level questions to ensure only aspiring math PhDs do well. Weekly quizzes, HW doesn't count for grade. Your grade comes from ordering final scores and finding ""gaps."" He turned a maybe fun class to a (toxic) sweaty competition. Lectures are okay if you like chalk talks. Nice guy; horrible attitude towards the world. | He is very intelligent but doesn't care about teaching. Gives no feedback unless you come to his office hours but not everybody has time for them. I personally regret taking the class with him. | He's a really nice guy but the class is insanely hard. I was super lazy and didn't do homework which is probably why is was hard but he also says that his exams are difficult. Homework isn't collected and the book doesn't help much. He goes over any homework question in class and is willing to clarify any confusion. (there's a curve at the end) | He goes very fast and assigns many homework problems. That being said, he is willing to help in class and office hours. A 1 problem quiz, mostly based on HW problems not collected nor graded, checks every week. He is willing to give feedback if you hand in your HW. Read book and notes, you will learn a lot! Recommend this friendly and nice guy! | Absolute math genius. If you want to learn how to solve Putnam problems, take this class. If you are not already a math whiz, you won't learn anything since it is too hard. But he is an IMO Gold medalist, which is completely insane. Professors as smart as him are incredibly rare at Rutgers. | Amazingly intelligent, but doesn't understand the art of teaching. Recites the theory, giving no insight into solving problems. Gives homework problems with no solutions in the book, which is a detriment. Avoid taking him - he is very intelligent, but doesn't teach well. Examples in class are hit and miss. | Calc 3: If you read the text book, do the required hws, and ask him questions on the hw problems you don't understand you have a good chance at doing well. Also, he gives out 3-4 practice exams for each of the 2 midterms and the final; make sure you understand these and you shouldn't have much trouble with the exams. | I took calculus 3 with him and I got an A. He is patient with students and very gentle, but his tests are not easy but not extremely hard either. homework problems are good to help your understanding, but not enough for the test because test problems are usually harder than textbook. Study you will be fine | Borisov's absolutely amazing. Calc 3 material is not easy, but he is very helpful during office hours and clarifies all the confusions you may have. Exams are difficult, challenging, I never studied so much before this class but I'm glad I did. He's nice and makes silly jokes and has the coolest accent ever. | Borisov is kind and intelligent., but he's a hit or miss every lecture. He makes up the examples he uses on the spot and they're often lousy. He's very open to questions though and reviews homework problems. | He takes a difficult subject and tries to make it as simple as he can. But he does throw some curveballs and tricky questions in his exams. Sometimes its a bit frustrating b/c the man is too smart and some students (like me) have no idea where he's getting some information from. Must study and put the hours in to get a good grade! Don't slack off! | If you go to his lectures and do your homework, then you will not have a problem doing well in this class. Yes, the exams are fair- a lot better than the other math professors' exams. He may make silly, yet funny math jokes during class. He's a nice guy. | Great professor. Explains everything in detail and is always willing to help if interrupted during lectures unless he's running low on time. Tests are fair and most come from the Hw problems. Do your Hw and attend lectures | Best class ever! At no point in class do you panic and think ""i'm going to have to teach myself this later"" and if u're confused he doesn't get annoyed if u interrupt him. His exams are SUPER fair, if u do bad its ur own fault. Stay on top of the hws the tests are based on notes & hw. There is no reason why u shouldn't get an A if u aren't lazy! | He is a respectable professor. This is a difficult course, but I find it easier than calc 2. Lev is a nice person and a very fair grader. Homework isn't collected, but you should still do it! If you study hard it will be reflected in your exam grades. I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, but he could have improved this year. | Amazing teacher. The people below are idiots. I haven't done anything calc related in over a year and I was able to keep up with the material in this class. You need to keep up with the homework. If you're lazy, you're going to fail regardless. That's probably what happened to the people below. I'm going to switch majors to math because of him. | First of all I feel as though there are only a HANDFUL of good professors in the Rutgers Math Department. But as for Borisov, he definitely knows his stuff but HE CANNOT teach it to save his life. He makes easy topics soooooo much more complicated than they need to be. If you can avoid his class...DO SO! | Ok, idk what the people below me are talking about unless they really don't have basic math skills. This guy's great! He teaches very well and his lectures make perfect sense. I went through my notes, didn't read the book, didn't do much hw, and got an A. His exams are straightforward and from his notes. He's a genius and very funny; take him. | If I didn't take calculus in high school, I would have easily failed this class. I love math, but I got very frustrated at at how he taught the subjects. He jumped into topics as if everyone knew it and his exams were much harder than other 135 teachers. I got an A just because I knew my stuff. If you didn't take calc in hs, do not take this class | Avoid if you can. Borisov tells you on the first lecture 40% of students are destined to fail... does little to encourage students. A smart man, but not so when it comes to teaching. Get tutoring and do all of the outlined practice problems! It's like the Cold War! You versus Him! | He sucks. Don't take his class, he wants you to fail. Enough said | What a lovely man he is. An absolute genius. I had lunch with him before the final and he helped me prepare."
"Cuadrado, Maria","Best math teacher I've had. Makes the class very doable as long as you do the homework and study. | Solid professor. Calc 5 is a tough class but she makes it manageable. She provides a lot of extra resources for students to study and she uploads her notes online after lecture. HW can get very lengthy and difficult but the bottom line is, as long as you put in the work and pay attention in lecture, you will definitely pass the class."
"Ross Pathak, Arianne","Overall great professor. Everything was clear and understandable in my experience. Flipped Classroom, did an online video every Sunday, classwork done in groups twice a week, and a quiz on topic of the week. She cares about her students, and is dedicated to her work. | Prof. Ross helped me love math. I came from a community college so I was worried but she made it easy. I hope to take her again! | Awful! I'm not great at math but this class felt impossible. I've taken a handful of maths here and this was the worst. I regret not withdrawing early in the semester. | Wouldn't recommend taking her, insanely fast at teaching, doesn't slow down, immense amouts of work, just dreaded this class. Don't take her | Disliked by much of the class. Gives too much homework and is not very good at explaining things clearly and concisely. Makes mistakes fairly often aswell."
"Schwarz, Jeff","I know I didn't take an extremely tough math class, but professor Schwarz has been really fun. He is funny during his lectures and clearly works out every problem. If you want to be successful in his class, you will need to work outside of class (1 hour of class, 3 hours studying). He is also super accessible for office ours. | He was my calc recitation prof, and honestly taught better than my actual calc lecturer. He starts off with easier problems and gives time to work on them. He explains everything well and posts it online afterwards. While he does provide a good foundation for learning, his problems are not nearly as difficult as the exam questions you'll get."
"George, Michael","Please take 10 minutes to review this question. | Doesn't fully explain concepts in lectures | Horrible teacher and very arrogant, has a superiority complex since he is our professor had to change my lecture section cause of how this guy taught as he overcomplicated everything. | I think hes a great prof! I havent talked to him much but hes really nice and explains concepts clearly. However, u should understand the pces before going to class. He answers all questions and is always active on piazza | Worst prof at u of t, ruined first-year engineering. However, he is, unfortunately, the coordinator of MAT186, making the worst assignments and tests. Those are just terrible as they require you so unnecessary stupid math communication thing. We engineering don't need this, you better get back to artsci! It was a disaster! 188>186! | He was always helpful."
"Shah, Dr. Rajiv","I took him for Data Structures over the summer in 2020, and it was horrifying. He posted 2 problem sets, which are supposed to be posted weekly, a day before the midterm, some TAs didn't know what was covered last week during the recitation or did not know how to share their screen, and the midterm had 4 questions in total and 2 of them had errors. | He doesnt reply to questions from students. He doesnt post assignments or lectures in a timely manner. He is not clear about his expectations and on the final there was a lot of confusion that he did not clear up until the last few hours we had to take it. He never actually looks at the assignemnts that r submitted | He seems busy to teach this course. His lecture is not very difficult to understand, just a little messy."
"Lee, Jae Ki","He's such a caring, sweet guy. I would definitely go to the lecture even though it not mandatory and go to his office hours if struggling. He genuinely wants to see you strive and succeed. | I had Jae Ki Lee as a TA for recitation. He is such as sweet guy and always made sure everyone understood the material before he moved on. When we have questions, he explains it super well. I actually learned more here than in actual lecture. Attendance is not mandatory, but you needed to show up to take the quizzes which were super easy. Take him!"
"Martin, Shannon","Professor Saavedra is a great professor. He was extremely easy to reach outside of class via email. His lectures are fast paced and although attendance isn't mandatory it is extremely important to go to class. There's about 6 homeworks the lowest one gets dropped and 2 midterms before the final. He is a professor you would want to take again. | This professor was very passionate about what's objectively one of the most boring subjects of all time, which I appreciated. However, his lectures were very fast paced and I feel like he didn't fully introduce concepts before relating them to the rest of the material. I definitely felt lost a lot of the time but there's a nice curve."
"Xie, Junming","Strict grader and doesn't answer questions well. Class is supposed to be easy but he's not a good lecturer so combine that with strict grading and that's no bueno. My second midterm was graded wrong by a large % and he eventually changed it but it's annoying that I had to get it fixed. I emailed him before and he never responded to me. | Linear Programming (354) is challenging but manageable with the professor's guidance. Attend class—his methods aren't in textbooks or YouTube, and Canvas notes lack context without his steps. Exams are fair but time-pressed. He's caring, though graders can be inconsistent. Stay on top of the material! | Math 354 = ""outstanding course."" Mr. Xie's lecturing? Not the best, or even close, but who cares when he's the GOAT! Just skip class! Homework (20%) is from the textbook—free 100. Midterms/finals? Exact practice problems with different numbers. Spent 20 min studying and aced it. Easiest A ever. I'd take Junming Xie 100 times over—absolute legend! | Boring lectures, subpar teaching. Not helpful when it came to questions. Exams are also graded quite harshly. Although averages for exams were low (in the 50s and 60s) and made up 80% of our grade, he did not lower the cutoff for an A. He also frequently made mistakes in solutions which made it difficult to study or understand.. | Not good at answering questions at all both in person and through email. | Extremely bad at answering questions. Ask a question and he'll always answer very vaguely as if he doesn't know the material himself. No partial credit on exams. Bad at emails. Getting a question just a little wrong means you will lose all points. Your grade is dependent on 2 midterms & 1 final. He is a polite guy-- just not equipped for teaching. | It is very clear he has not taught before. For his lectures, he strictly reads off the textbook and just copies the work done in the textbook down, and is just a poor lecturer in general. Although he is a nice person, as a professor, his exams are unreasonably difficult, in comparison to other professors who taught the same course. | Avoid at all costs. Only about 1/4 of the class shows up to lectures, and for good reason. The professor strictly follows the textbook and provides no other resources. All of the HW and most of the exam problems are copied from the textbook. | Lectures are clear, and he provides organized notes during class that he also posts online, which are great study resources. Homework problems are from textbook, which can sometimes be very difficult. He does not provide supplemental resources to his lecture notes & the textbook, so your options for studying are limited. Overall a decent professor. | He is a really good lecturer and I learned a lot in this course. He was always willing to answer my questions and meet with me to discuss different topics. However, he did mess up one of the exams in terms of difficulty. Additionally, while exams are such a high weight on the grade he did not provide any additional resources to study. | He has very clearly never taught before. He just projects sloppily handwritten notes that he reads word for word with no explanation. I'm usually able to do well even with harder professors, but the lack of resources provided and his method of teaching made it a million times more difficult than it should have been."
"Sequin, Matt","This professor is an amazing recitation professor. He goes over problems that are not only going to be on the quiz at the end of class, but also for the exam. He goes over everything so it is easy to understand. I don't even go to the lectures; just come to his class"
"Vinci, Sarina","I had her for life drawing in spring of 2015 and because of what I've learned from her, I've gotten better at drawing human figures. for example, she got me to understand that our faces are the same height as the hand. I've never noticed that until then. So I've learned quite a bit when it comes to drawing people. that class was very useful for me. | She's very nice and laid back but her grading is overly tough especially on something that is an opinion on how good it is or not. I was stressed all semester and my grades in other classes started to suffer because of how much assignments she gives. Don't take, if you need an art credit think art appreciation or art history. | I loved loved loved having Sarina for Drawing I! She is such an amazing artist and teacher and she went out of her way to relate to students and connect with us. I took her class on Fridays for pretty much the whole day and it was not the easiest class but she definitely pushed my drawing skills to become better."
"Yeung, Marc","AWFUL he does not explain things well at all. DO NOT take this class with him. | He does not explain things well at all. it takes him an entire class period to explain one problem. The material is easy, but he makes it harder than he needs to. Tests are too long to finish within class. I recommend the class but with a different professor. I only learned things because I taught myself the material using the book. He is awful | The material is easy, but his teaching methods make it so much harder to understand. He spends an entire class going over one problem that could take five minutes. He takes attendance, so you have to go to class, which sucks because the class is very boring and you can learn all the material from the textbook."
"Stone, Corey","Such a sweet guy. Really took his class for granted but he made sure all of us tried our best. He constantly answered questions anyone had and went over any specific problems when we asked. Hands down the best math professor | Lectures were very good and made homework easy. | I came into Calculus 135 not having a strong foundation (did not take AP in high school). However, Professor Stone is very clear when he explains the material. He goes at a good pace and will go over anything the students request. He is super kind and very understanding. Favorite professor at Rutgers so far. Highly recommend him for Calculus 135! | Prof Stone is a great lecturer and always willing to offer help. He does not make you feel stupid and is super patient with annoying classmates. He explains things pretty well. If you get him for calc, you are super lucky. | Amazing prof. definitely my all time fav math prof from ru. he's so kind and he answers every question respectfully- no matter how dumb. even his exams are pretty easy. although, he teaches through a notebook projected onto the screen and handwrites notes (posts them after each lecture tho) so that could be a little downside if you sit far away | Prof. Stone was great for Calc 2! He explains concepts clearly and is very approachable for questions. Some conceptual exam questions are a little challenging, but if you prepare with the review materials, past exams, and homework, you should do well. The recitation quizzes are not bad and similar to problems from class. | I took Calculus 152H (the honors section) with Professor Stone. He was a wonderful Professor, patiently explained every concept, was knowledgeable about questions beyond the syllabus also, and was available outside of class if we had any questions. Would highly recommend him. | Had him for calc 135 and loved him!! Went slow and did a great job of making sure we understood the topics. Class gave a lot of homework assignments, but that is understandable for a math class. Would highly recommend him to anyone taking calc! | This professor was very kind and patient with our class this semester. He explained this clearly and multiple times if anyone didn't understand. I would honestly recommend taking his class. | This class (MATH 152 - Calculus 2) was kind of annoying and a lot of work. I feel like I did not really gain anything from the lectures, but they were not bad. As long as you put in the work you can do well in the class."
"Mallick, Abhishek","retook w/Bhattacharjee & he's a breath of fresh air. Prof B went the extra mile giving us voice recordings of lectures, extra time for assignments, extra credit, using feedback to modify the class. He explains the material in a way that is easy to understand & thoroughly answers questions. Plus class was fun! I couldn't ask for a better teacher | Wish I took Menedez's section instead of his. Bhattacharjee's great at teaching, but he lacked in course organization. He had the unofficial head TA, who was not so great at teaching, teach a couple lectures. He also had the class use the Sakai chatroom, which is garbage, esp. when sites such as Piazza exist and have been used by other CS profs. | Where do I even start with Abhishek. He's literally the god of Computer Architecture. Very intelligent, teaches the material very well, and makes sure you understand concepts. He's so knowledgeable that it's as if he's there's a comp arch textbook implanted in his brain. He's a genius. Abhishek, if you're reading this, thanks for inspiring me! | Lectures are great he conveys the material very well and I you raise your hand he will go over the material until you get it. A little intimidating to raise your hand because he is extremely bright. Projects are tough start them early and get help from tas if you need it. | Great professor. The only point of criticism I have is that he often lectures very quickly. However, he responds to any questions you have proficiently, and he will go out of his way to help you understand the concept. He is energetic and funny. He even changed the future direction of the class based on student input. Great professor. | Hes young, knowledgeable, has high-enegy, passionate and very charismatic. Makes the material very enjoyable to learn. 10/10 would take again. | He is very nice professor, hilarious also. He answered every single question that student ask in class. Attendance is not a mandatory but you have to be there and pay attention to pass the class. he upload ppt, recommend to print them and bring to class. project it self is hard, so please start early. | I love this man. A hilarious lecturer, an incredibly bright individual, and a kind and caring professor. He is probably one of the best in the CS department, and his class actually teaches you interesting things. Definitely take him for Comp Arch if you can - he only teaches in the fall. Curve is great too. | Honestly he makes it really easy on you. Material is hard, but Abhishek has a super generous grading scheme, he basically gives you the exam questions before the test, and the average is usually a B/B+. Also he gives great lectures, and I really learned a lot with him. Great professor, probably the easiest CS class I've taken so far. | The best class on Computer Architecture. Abhishek if you reading this , thanks for inspiring me. We love you! | AB is the man. | There's a lot of material in the class but the good news is that assignments and practice questions prep you for the final. Dont sweat it if you tank an assignment here and there. Material is presented crystal clear so take notes in class. Bit of a hottie too. | 211 is notorious for being a ""C"" class, but Bhattacharjee emphasizes digital logic much more. He threatens to give (and thus makes you prepare for) harder questions than actually appear on exams. When he tells you to ""go home and stare at this slide"", actually do it, because some things seem to make perfect sense when he explains it, but not later. | I was not looking forwards to this class but the professor made the class amazing. He definitely gives you a TON of information in lectures but it's always super clear. The coding assignments weren't too bad. Curve is really good. Possibly my favorite CS course so far. | c, assembly, digital logic is a lot to put into one class. grading is cool though. talks too fast, so stop him and ask questions. but he's hilarious/cute so that helps :) | go to lectures and definitely go to recitations. also be prepared to spend time looking up other resources online. you learn a lot by the end though. | Way too much material but it really helps to go to lectures. He's also easy on the eyes so that always helps ;) | Tough class. | Really genius Professor and very motivational. too lenient with grades if you show a liitle hard effort in his course. really enjoyed studying and got to learn a lot from this course Grade Received -A | Very clear and concise professor. Knows the material very well and very interested in it. He keeps the class moving but makes sure that you understand the material, so you learn a lot in lecture and never get bored. Possibly the best professor I ever had. Highly recommended | He is very clear in lectures and good at explaining the material. Some of the assignments can be very difficult with a lot of work involved but don't get too stressed out with them he gives a very good curve. I completely bombed one of the assignments and still managed an A in the course. | Tough class but he's clear (and funny). Reasonable exams but some hws are not. Know people who went to school with the dude and he has a reputation - an academic whiz (one problem is that he can go through stuff too quickly) and baller at tennis (he's hot). He'll work with you to get an A (he's considerate, coached disabled kids tennis in school). | Great class! very sweet guy. i would definatly recoomend going to all classes, and even if you dont do well on the assigemnts its all good. He is hot too another motivation to go to class. | I learned most of the stuff from the TA classes because he was not be able to attend so many lectures. Don't take this course if you want to learn something from himself!!! | Class is easy if you go to lectures and pay attention, etc. But the real reason I'm leaving this review: Abhi is sooooo hot. I would sit there and get so distracted by his forearms and other ahem things. sorry for perving Abhi, I'm sure you read these, but yeah I didn't have trouble motivating myself to go to class. I want you, are you single? | He is not a good teacher at all. useless class | The dude is a really nice guy and is very knowledgeable about what he's teaching. He lectures a bit fast for some people but he encourages students to stop him if they fall off his high-speed train of thought. The course has a juicy curve so don't sweat it if you tank an assignment or two. | Abhishek is one of the best professors in the CS department. He's extremely reasonable, if you talk to him about any situation you're in, he'll work with you. He talks quite fast so when he says something will be on the exam, make sure you write it down. Pay attention and ask him questions and you'll do fine. | Great professor. Didn't really have to go to class and he drops a lot of grades to help everyone do well. Exams are made up of mostly old midterm questions, including the final! Also has an awesome curve. Would take another class with this guy | not clear at all. low knowledge. hard to follow. not good professor. I shouldn't have taken this course with him. | He's really knowledgeable, one of the best professors at Rutgers CS. His exams are straight forward and easy. He really gets you interested in what he's teaching. | Possibly the best professor I've ever had. Extremely approachable and helpful, does whatever he can to make sure you learn and do well. Course is curved heavily in whatever way helps the most people, regardless of whether it needs to be or not. | It was difficult but he made the experience worth it. Seeing his luscious curls made my whole week. He's a wonderful motivator when he catches my gaze with his naughty smile. I did poorly on a test and asked if there is anything I could do. He let me make it up w/ another assignment though I was hoping for more. Recommended-I'd go back for more | Excellent and brilliant professor. This class is hard. Pay attention, dedicate a couple of hours a week to study and you will really enjoy his class. He takes a lot of time to answer student's questions and really wants you to understand. Anything that you ask, he will have an amazing answer. 100% recommended but you still need to study by yourself | Here are my two cents...if you are a computer science nerd and don't do anything else in life, he will be a great teacher. otherwise, he is speaking a different language. | He knows what he's talking about, is organized, and speaks clearly. I think he tries too hard to be ""cool"" though. So undergrads don't like to go to class or read the textbook. Joking about it as a professor is in poor taste. Also, word of advice to students, GO TO RECITATIONS. Much of the test material will come from there. Read the textbook, too. | Best professor. very knowledgeable. Well designed course structure. | LOL the person above is prolly mad because he did not do well. He is a nice guy who keeps the class interesting. The 1st time through a topic can be confusing but he takes all questions and can clarify things well if you ask. Gives reasonable hw. THE ONLY TIME he ever sounds condescending is for questions like, ""Wait, the HW is due in 2 days?!"" LOL | Laughs/mocks at students when they ask questions. Very unhelpful and gives unclear and confusing assignments. Thinks he is funny, and sort of is, but he is full of himself. He went to princeton and thinks he is better than us."
"Hallgren, Maximilien","Hes a nice guy but didn't explain things in a very engaging way. I learned most things from the tutors in the Math Learning Center, not from the lectures. | Péroux is super nice and caring. The class is set up in a way that there is a quiz or two every week, but we get 3 shots for each graded objective. The system is set up so that there is a lot of work for us students, but the professor is doing a great job with what is given. | Professor Peroux is an effective and accommodating teacher, but the course content is challenging. Expect weekly quizzes with the material. If you attend class, pay attention, and complete the work, you will pass. Homework and attendance aren't mandatory, but in-class assignments and quizzes are required. Good teacher, bad course. Would take again. | It is at a fast pace during class. Sometimes, it is hard to keep up with what is shown on the board, and sometimes, there would be five minutes left of class, and he would rush through a new lesson. | He's a god guy overall but him having a French accent doesn't help anyone in the class. People are often confused with what he is saying. Overall he's a good teacher but understanding during lectures can be difficult."
"Rocha Vieira, Ewerton","Lectures feel so long and she reads off the slides and the assigned readings (are optional, but if you want a participation grade, read them). As for the work, all of her answers are on the slides as she intended them to be, but she is picky towards what she wants to see in those answers (puts you on blast). Overall, very boring but easy class. | It is obvious she is very passionate about the subject and her lectures are interesting. But, she is a tough grader, maybe even a perfectionist. Good luck having an opinion of your own, she will mark it wrong. It doesn't help that her assignments heavily rely on group work, which jeopardizes the grades of those who actually want to do the work. | As an honors student I believed I could handle an unliked professor, but I beg you not to take her class. Rude, vindictive, always bothered, screams at you if you email or ask for help, no freedom of speech for her ""debates"" once a week, and her grading allows for students who excel to be dragged down by other group members. Not a good person. | Avoid at all costs. All she cares about is Brazil. And the smelling like smoke thing that others state, is absoultely true. Almost passed out from it. | Professor Rocha proved to be quite knowledgeable about what she teaches. She's a tough grader though! So stick to her slides verbatim and make sure you bring her readings to class. The class does get a little boring at times, but it's an easy class for credits tbh. No laptops or phones and she does take attendance daily. | Avoid her at any cost! There is no freedom of speech in her class. God forbid students have a different opinion other than hers or whatever is on her slides. Dictatorship approach toward her students and no outside sources or information is allowed to be used. Will give 0 points if your answer doesn't coincide with her vision or concepts! | I took this class for the credit, but being a stem major, when I tell you that she is the worst, she really is. I thought I could handle it because of my past classes, but no. There is so much work for a 101 class and she doesn't like hearing any other opinions. She is old, yells and smells like smoke. She also laughed when I made a mistake.Rude af | Literally one of the most narcissistic individuals I've ever met. Although Prof. Rocha is super passionate about the course, she's blinded by the fact that she sees herself as the ultimate source. There's 4 questionnaires (group project - MANDATORY), 2 midterms, and 1 final powerpoint group presentation. The only source you're allowed to use is her | I have never posted on here before but this is the worst professor I have ever had the terror of having in class. She is rude, condescending, is unclear in her instruction, is an awful teacher, bad at tech, is not suited to be in an educational setting. I have never been more dissatisfied in a class (I'm a straight A's student with 3 minors) | Listen. Is Rocha an amazing professor? No. But if you're a good student, willing to put in some work, participate in class, and bear through frequent idiotic group projects, her class fulfills a few core requirements, so it might just be worth it. Don't expect her to be nice or polite -- she's not. Breathe out, and power through it. You'll be fine. | Politically incorrect as hell, she makes snide comments here and there and its just surprising that this woman has a PhD. Pray you get a good group. My classes were moved online yet somehow she managed to find ways to take off points for anything. She is so not clear about what she wants, avoid her, can't stand her or her smokers voice. | DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS OR PROFESSOR. The actuall amount of work is relatively low. Professor is condescending as others have stated. Group projects are 20% of grade, and your group will probably bring your grade down if your a descent student. Pretty much just a poli-sci of latin america class. Focus on europe/u.s. influences, skips over the rest | If you're willing to settle for less, this course is an easy B-B+. IF you're aiming for an A, I STRONGLY suggest you search elsewhere. The two SAS Core req's are tempting, but not worth. Prof: passionate, informed BUT often rude, condescending Indiv. Work: reasonable amount BUT grading is inconsistent and unclear Group work: pray for a good group | If you have a genuine interest in Latin America take this professor, Dr. Rocha gets swept away in the material and she demonstrates the depth of her knowledge during the lectures and ""discussions"". During presentations she interrupts to correct students, at first the class may seem disorganized but as it progresses her teaching style makes sense. | Worst class I have ever had. Professor interrupted a student during her presentation close to 15 times and keeps class around 15 minutes AFTER the period has ended. If anyone tries to get up and leave she will not allow it. The material is extremely confusing and the lecture is painful to sit through. do not take this course!! | This professor may be too passionate about the subject matter. Though participation supposedly matters, she interrupts and cuts students off when they speak. There seems to be no room for confusion or getting clarity on topics. Instructions of major assignments are extremely unclear. Readings are helpful, lectures may become unclear too. | Professor Rocha was very passionate for teaching Latin America: An Introduction. She had a midterm & final exam that were straightforward. She assigns group work, luckily its only a small part of your grade. You have to attend a film for an assignment & a second one optional for extra credit. Not a bad teacher, very nice, just a tough grader. | Hardest A of my life....... The exams are easy but it's super hard to nail the essay part of the exams. Most stressful class and I'm an IT major... | Shes a difficult grader and her grading of group work is based of vague standards. I admire her passion for the class, but there is such a thing as too passionate. Her exams are basically the PowerPoints so thats nice I guess. Overall, not the best teacher and If possible just dont take her class. If you do, just find someone to sign you in :) | Pros: 1) exam questions are pulled from the slides verbatim Cons: 1) vague grading criteria for essays 2) 1 point off grade for each missed class 3) overly passionate (may be a pro for you) and bad at articulating points 4) terrible handwriting so you can barely understand her essay critiques | Professor Rocha is not easy. She shouldn't be taken lightly because she does give out a lot of information. Although she is a tough grader, she isn't that bad because she is just passionate about the course. However, there is no final and her tests are literally all from her powerpoints which you can print out if needed. | DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. The way she grades is extremely unfair since most of your grade depends on the group projects (which you have little to no control over). Her grading is extremely harsh and she does not explain how to do well on the essays or any of the open ended questionnaires. The cut off for an A is also high (3). | I love history and enjoyed this class, but Rocha was a tough grader. It is very difficult to get an A, because she is strict in what she wants students to write. If it's not exactly in the wording she wants, she will take off points. The readings are unnecessary. Go to her extra credit opportunities and make sure to go to class. | She is very unprofessional and a tough grader. She will help you if you need it, but she's condescending while doing so. It's hard to get an A mainly because of the group projects and she's tough on essays. The exams were easy but it can be tough to do well on them. I was interested in the subject, but Rocha really discouraged me. Dont do readings. | Professor Rocha was not a good professor at all. She has a really heavy accent. She does these ridiculous debates and calls on people if theres not even people participating so you have to come in prepared. She also does a lot of group projects and grades those really harshly its not easy to get a good grade in that class. I would not recommend her | She is rude and unprofessional. Too harsh of a grader for the parameters of the assignments, and while it is not hard to get a B, it is near impossible to get an A (93) due to harsh grading and group assignments where everybody receives the same grade. 1 point is deducted from final grade every missed class. Incredibly boring - overall don't take. | This class is really based on the readings and slides you can access online. This is where you are going to do most of your learning as she doesnt add much context herself in her lectures but attendance is mandatory. There are group projects which like everything else you hand in class, she grades very harshly. She also has a heavy accent. | Professor Rocha is extremely passionate about Latin American studies and forgets this is an intro course. She makes you do readings and participate in a group which kind of determines your grade. However to do well on the exams just review the powerpoints and usually theres a test bank floating around somewhere. | At first, she seems like a tough teacher but the course is actually very simple. Just show up to class because she takes attendance and review all the slides for the exams (which are easy) and you should be fine. The lectures are pretty long and boring but she's very kind when you speak to her and passionate about what she teaches. | Professor Rocha can be very annoying and drones on, but it's worth it for the requirements. You have two exams, one midterm and a final which is nit accumulative. You have 4 group questionnaires which can be very annoying and hard to get an A on. You can do well on her tests by just studying her slides, she keeps them on sakai. Has extra credit. | She's so passionate about the subject, but lectures are boring. There's 2 exams, 1 group project, & 4 questionnaires. The second exam was extremely easy, just study the slides and you'll be fine. She also gives extra credit. | Rocha is one of my favorite professors because of the passion that she has on the topic. Exams are easy if you know the subject. Just skim through the readings because it helps form a base of your argument and helps with assignments she gives. Participate in the debates. Pretty easy class, take if interested in politics/history of Latin America. | Class content was really interesting. She is not the nicest person but the class is relatively easy. I skimmed the material and got a 100 on both exams. Going to class is crucial though! I don't recommend taking the class unless you have an interest in politics/history. | Professor Rocha is extremely rude, I have never had a worse experience with a professor. Before taking her class you must know how to do things HER way, she's very particular on how she wants things. Exams are easy but the group projects killed me and she doesn't care if you do good and your group does bad. | Easy A class that fulfills requirements. Was on Facebook the entire class but only went because your participation points are attendance. Guest speakers, movies, debates, for everything I was not mentally present and still got an A. She is super nice but crazy!!! (You'll see what I mean!!) not in a bad way though. Take her. | Probably one of the easiest classes I've ever taken. Studied her slides like an hour before both exams and Aced both of them. 25 question exams that take about 20-30 mins MAX! No final!!! Have to go to class because she takes attendance but slept through class and passed with an A :) | I loved this class! The info was really interesting and Geisa is a really good lecturer! The exams were easy and you can get an A even if you don't do the readings (but go to class!!). The only thing I disliked were the group study guides. They brought my grade down because my members didn't want to follow instructions :( | Has a strong accent but understandable. Very passionate about material, which turned out to be interesting. Very opinionated and doesn't allow for much discussion against her beliefs but still a great class. Guest lectures. Exams based off of PPP, multiple choice and easy if you study questionnaires. Questionnaires are annoying but not difficult. | Her accent is hard to understand but she really loves what she teaches. Everything you need to know about the class is in the syllabus, (whenever someone has a question she usually tells them to look in the syllabus). Exams and group work are all straight forward and from her powerpoints. Just study and keep up and you'll get an easy A! | Tests are based off POWERPOINTS! read some of the readings. go to class (only allows 3 absences) or have someone sign you in. do 1 extra credit assignment. An A is very doable if you put a little effort in. i'd recommend taking another class, but if you are stuck with this one--it isnt the end of the world. | Study the slides. 2 exams, 1 presentation, and 4 questionnaires. GOODLUCK | She is one of the most straight forward professors I know. Study and remember her slides and that's all you will need for the exams. NO TEXTBOOK REQUIRED! | Has a Brazilian accent so its a lil hard to understand. READ before going to class is a MUST because she asks questions which btw are relevant to the exam ques. She shows movies and brings in lecturers. Questionnaires aren't a big deal. She loves participation but make sure you know your stuff because she'll correct you and gives extra credit too!! | For Professor Geisa's questionairres, she's a very opinionated teacher, so it's important to say everything she wants in HER words. Also, she doesn't include everything she wants you to include in the prompts, so it's up to you to either be SURE that everything is right, or contact her about exactly what she wants. | She is difficult to understand but the topics are easy and interesting, exams are straightforward even without the readings. Focus on her lectures for exams show some interest and you will do fine. | Interesting teacher and she's really into what she's teaching. There's a lot of guest speakers but the exams focus on her lecture topics mostly. 2 Exams not cumalative, and everything that's on the exams is on the questionaires so if you study those you're fine. She love those who participate. | Assigns way to many readings! I Honestly gave up after the second week. When it came to the midterm and final (which is not cumulative) I pulled an all nighter and aced both tests. Just study hard and pay attention in class. Easy A if you put in the work | She'll talk really low, so low you cannot hear her and then emphasis her point at the top of her lungs. But you have no idea what she is even talking about because she said the entire thing so low. She doesn't know how to teach to students, I cannot even keep up in class because I feel like its more of an economics class then a history course. | I can't understand a damn thing she says. I have her for Latin America's History...she assigns about 100+ pages per night, and expects us to know each author's life story. She's always yelling, rather than talking... absolutely insane! | LOVE LOVE LOVE her. its a shame she doesn't teach at rutgers anymore. | As long as you do your exercises before class and read the story for class and come with the questions answered, this class will be an absolute breeze. The tests are extremely easy if you pay attention. Only negative is that there is a strict attendance policy and the class is 2 hours long so grammar gets old. | I love Rocha! If you do your work and keep up, she will like you and you will get a good grade. Overall she grades you on your performance AND your effort, so if you actually try you will get a good grade. | I have no idea why someone who is supposed to be an intellect cannot teach, but she apparently is good at not teaching. I'll admit she is very intelligent, but although she has a PhD, which implies intellect, she cannot transfer knowledge at all to students. | She is quite possibly the worst Prof I have ever encountered at Rutgers, having to take 2 classes with her made my semester a nightmare. Expects you to know everything and refuses to explain anything. On top of that she has very strong opinions that she pretty much forces onto students; and punishes those who do NOT regurgitate her opinion back. | This lady is the WORST Portuguese professor at Rutgers. She's smart, no doubt, but as a professor, has no skill whatsoever!!!! If you have the option, take classes with Serra or Rothwell! Have to work hard in their classes, but at least it's worth it, unlike Rocha who insists on having you do the work b4 she TEACHES!!! | Rocha is the worst professor I have ever had the misfortune of being taught (or should I say not taught) by. She doesn't know how to teach and expects her students to know everything before she teaches. If you don't know something during class she puts you on the spot. In Ad, Grammar for Portuguese all we learn is the subjunctive... | rocha rocha rocha...she is very knowledgable yet her approach in teaching a class is too forceful...she quickly corrects you midsentence, has a thick accent and sometimes goes bizurck on you though at times its entertaining...you have to go to class as well...and participate=read= doesnt usually happen... | I am a native Brazilian, but never took classes on Portuguese. She made it extremly difficult to understand the materials and texts (first day of class, she spoke Portuguese and I was totally lost). We never learned the fundamentals like alphabets. Expect to teach yourself the course, because she assigns new material before we go over it in class | I took her class for IntermPort. I felt that she was ridiculously arrogant. I have nothing against learning about Brazil, but it was awkward that a PORTUGUESE class didn't have one lesson about PORTUGAL and that it was solely focused on Brazil. Overall she expects people to just know things & doesnt teach you the material until after the hw is due | I took her seminar on globalization. She is very knowledgeable about ALL of Latin America, and she expresses that very well. She is not an easy grader, as she expects her students to really know their stuff. If you read before the classes, write good papers, and actually participate, you'll get an A, no problem. Erratic, but fun to watch. | Some of the negative reviews here of Prof. Rocha are complete B.S. There is nothing wrong with a professor expressing her views on a subject, as long as she doesn't force her students to accept them or penalizes them for disagreeing. All students were free to express their views in the regularly-held in-class debates. | the class is actually really easy if you just read and repeat exactly what she says/thinks. but you go in there thinking you'll learn about latin america as a whole and really all you learn about is HER country and HER thoughts and how bad america is. otherwise, she's pretty nice. just a little erratic. | If you read the texts, you'll find the class is very straight-forward. However, her lectures couldn't be more disorganized, flustered or tangential. What's worse, is that far from a dispassionate scholar, Rocha is an unabashed Brazilian nationalist who hates everything about America except the salary it allows her to enjoy. A disgrace to academia. | This professor was quite possibly the worst, most biased professor I have ever had in my life. She is more concerned with imposing her personal views on the class instead of teaching, and she does not present both views of controversial subjects well. To get a good grade, all you have to do is regurgitate whatever she tells you. | Good professor. You will learn a lot. There is a lot of work. You need a 92 to get an A, though, which might be the only way I don't get the A that I probably deserve. She's a lil crazy, and doesn't always respond to questions. You will learn a lot, but there's a lot of work, and it's not an easy grade. Hard course for intro level. | If you want a good grade in this class, you're gonna have to study! Has a rather arrogant attitude when you ask questions, expecting you to already understand difficult terms, but is always available in office hour/email for further explanation. She knows so much!-and backs it up with evidence/facts! Gives so many examples-hands out tons articles. | The way she taught this class seemed to have more to do with her views on ""how bad the United States"" rather than the actuall material that should have been learned. Not very effective in her approach and seemed to care less about relevant facts than imposing her own opinion on the students | Tough but learned a lot. She is pretty cool as long as you're on her good side. She teaches Portuguese for Spanish speakers yet she doesn't know Spanish. That was a problem."
"Gunby-Mann, Benjamin","This was apparently his last semester teaching at Rutgers :( Had him for Graph Theory. Professor Gunby is a very fair and cool guy. 30% HW/70% Exams, but he gave extra credit and was super helpful in office hours. Exams were pretty difficult but graded generously. He did go over lecture time occasionally but he was otherwise an awesome professor. | Professor Gunby is amazing. He's super interested in math and very approachable and friendly at office hours, and is a great instructor on top of all of that. Math 300 was certainly a bit challenging but he gives you more than enough to do well. I don't think I would have ever found any interest in math if not for him. He probably changed my life. | I'll start with the flaw -- homework takes so much time and is so difficult! Unimaginable difficulty. His class was harder than the honors section! Now, the good things: His exams are reasonable, he is an EXCELLENT teacher, and he is friendly and personal with students. If you want a challenge, take his course, but be warned -- he is VERY HARD! | Let M = {math professors at Rutgers} and g = Benjamin Gunby. Theorem. g = max(M) Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists p in M such that p > g. This is a contradiction by the Gunby postulate. Therefore, g is an upper bound of M. Since g is an element of M, g = max(M). This concludes the proof. QED"
"D'Elia, Elizabeth","(Review coming from a slacker): Only attended class 3 times, those being exam 1, exam 2, and the final. got an A in the course. 3 exams and an essay with attendance not mandatory. plenty of opportunities to get extra credit. take this course with this professor for an easy grade. don't know the prof all too well but she seemed nice lol | Gave a cheat sheet for the last 2 exams, you can write anything on the front and back. Super fair tests, usually 40-50 multiple choice, and a paper (3 pages singled space) that really brings up your grade. Provides extra credit, super easy class. | The class isn't hugely engaging. It's easy though, if you pay loose attention in class and skim the textbook readings, you'll do fine. Her presentations are well-organized and informative, just not particularly engaging (which makes it hard to focus). Tests are pretty ok and online quizzes are a breeze (plus you're given infinite retries). | Lots of textbook reading and a complete bore; not to mention she gives NO curves with her difficult exams. If you take ES with her, you're going to have a bad time. | Nope. Just don't do it. | Would not recommend taking her. Other classes have a curve, but not this one for some unknown reason. | Good lecturer, tests are not that hard as long as you read the book and slides, do the extra credit and you'll get an A. | Class was really easy but the Exams were on another level. Way too difficult and shifted the balance of the class to the VERY DIFFICULT side. | dont take her.. 3 exams no curve really hard 2 right answers for each question not based on lecture or textbook!!! she is the WORST | her exams are hard, the average exam grades are Cs.. I studied for 2 weeks straight and still got Cs on all the exams. Her exams are impossible, 2 - 3 right answers for every question. do yourself a favor.. dont take her, take phelps. if shes the only one left dont take her!!! | She's alright. Nothing special. It's a pretty easy class but the lectures can be really boring. Read the textbook and review the powerpoint notes and you should be good. She likes to give pop quizzes that will lower your grade though. I lost my A in that class because of them. | She's a pretty nice teacher. Hard to get an A if you're not a science major. Definitely a easy B+ at the least. 300 points total. 20 points possible extra credit. THREE 75 point exams, and only 2 homeworks that are very easy. Also, there is a 3 page, single-spaced paper you must do by the end of the sem. Phelps/Strom is easier, but Ravit isn't bad | Way too hard for a 101 science class, must go to class because she has pop quizzes. Slides do not make sense by just reading them, you have to pay attention to her lecture. There is extra credit by attending seminars, but most seminars are during the day when we have other classes. do not take for easy science class! | Lots of extra credit (20pts) easy to get. Always available. Slides online, 2 homework assignments all easy. Tests can be difficult, you gotta read the book- make notecards cause it's a lot of definitions, easy to get a B in have to work hard for the A though. Very, very nice woman , attendence is not mandatory. | NOT recommended for a science filler in the SAS. This class is more for students who want to major in Environmental Science. Her final is impossible. brought my solid A down to a B!! Need to read a lot to maintain grade. Overall: not an easy A, need to put in lotsa time. Take it with Strom if you HAVE to take this class. Doable tho. | Extremely nice professor! Outlines in powerpoint slides, but most info is in the book. Lets you get up to 20 extra credit points toward your final grade. She was very helpful and wants students to learn. I would def. take a class with her again :)"
"Khaitan, Ayush","Math 230 is pretty difficult, but he makes it fine. He posts his notes weekly, so attendance isn't technically mandatory. Sometimes can be confusing with due dates, but is very understanding and takes feedback from class. We've only had one quiz and it was take home. Is accessible in office hours, and goes slow enough in class to keep good notes. | This man was awesome. The homework was long, but he was always willing to give the class an extension when necessary. His quizzes were just a way to force us to study, and easy points. The exams were fair, and he is an easy grader. He's also always willing to meet with students and answer questions whenever. He is a kind soul and great professor. | Class is very lecture heavy with lots and lots of homework. The homework deadlines often change with little notice. Exam grading is lenient, but seems arbitrary at times and no feedback is left."
"Kriventsov, Dennis","The best math teacher I've ever had | Mr Kriventsov was a great teacher but sometimes went off on tangents that confused the class. A lot of questions on midterms stemmed from some abstract concepts in lecture so it would be helpful to go regardless of attendance. The 2 midterms and final were 80% of the grade so its very top heavy -- if you know the computational methods youre good. | Note that this is a review for MATH 252, not linear algebra (wasn't an option in the dropdown). Very easy-going guy who has a genuine interest in teaching mathematics. He always tells you more-or-less exactly what he expects from you, and gives you a good idea of what the grade cutoffs are like after each exam. An 84% was an A for our class. | Kriventsov does teach the subject well, but his exams are a little harder than other professors. If you never taken linear algebra in HS before, do the suggested problems in the textbook because the Matlab does not prepare you for exams. | He's a pretty good lecturer who makes analysis interesting, exciting even! 311 is a very difficult class in general so there was definitely lots of reading and homework (which is to be expected) but I always looked forward to his lectures. He may come off as a bit intimidating but he's very easy to approach and accommodating. Definitely recommend!"
"Van De Moortel, Maxime","Great lectures. Really easy mid-terms. Really difficult final. | This professor is amazing. His lectures were a really good introduction to Calculus in 3 dimensions. He was clear and if you couldn't understand his handwriting then you could just ask him to clarify. He was very insightful and helpful when you asked questions and always helped clarify. His tests were mixed with 2 midterms being ez n the final HARD | Guy has a French(maybe Dutch) accent that is hard to understand. He also writes in unreadable cursive with chalk on the blackboard. If you can't understand him, just skip his lectures and read the textbook before class and study on your own. After all, I think it will always be better to study on your own than trying to rely on a ""good"" professor."
"Tobasco, Ian","I had him for 291 & 477. Very by-the-book lecturer. Super organized, writes compactly(make sure you know your math notation!), and comes prepared. His tests are fairly short, more theoretical than computational. He's amazing at answering questions, even if it's a touch vague he can usually tell what you're getting at and explain it more precisely. | Prof.Jauslin is a nice professor. He tries to explain everything as easy as possible to let you understand. His lecture is clear and always gives good examples. And he will give study guide and practice exams before midterms and final. Those are quite helpful for me. :) | Good professor, this is actually for Math 477 (I have no option to change the class number) but class was straightforward and he is a nice lecturer. Homework was short but contained challenging problems. | Although a very difficult class, Prof. Jauslin made the class easy to understand and fun. Be warned though, the course load is significant and this class isn't for everyone. But if you love math, you'll have a great time; he takes care in answering questions and hosts helpful recitations. He also made our class interactive and posts helpful labs. | An amazing lecturer who is very organized in his presentation. He presents some of the content in interesting and engaging ways (like bringing instruments to class), and overall it's a fun experience. I thought that a differential equations course would be computational and not interesting, but Professor Jauslin's 292 defied these expectations."
"Zou, Jiahua","This was one of the most useless classes I've taken in the MAE curriculum... he cannot teach for his life and doesn't care to help students understand the material at all. | Total dawg. Miss him to death. Great dude. | He allowed us to do lab reports in groups. Exams and homeworks are difficult but doable if you attend classes and take notes. Grade was curved. | This professor is the type to care more about their own research for the school, then the students attending the school. Empty Lecture slides online, rendering them useless. Handwriting is terrible, barely legible. When asking a question, answers with,"" You should know this; not going to repeat myself; you learned this already"". -1000/10 | Worst professor for senior MechE lab. Not sure why this class is so poorly run. Saw him once over the course of a semester. The class is all run by indifferent and strict TA's. | Worst Professor ever, lectures arent even worth going to. The exams are total curve balls, you wont know anything in the exam. Even if you write out all the formulas on a sheet for the exam, the formulas wont help because theres thousands of formulas, where he never even mentions. He doesnt give practice exams to show you what might be on the exam. | Worst professor ever. | I have him for measurements right now and it's terrible! He's unclear and doesn't explain things :("
"Tahvildar-Zadeh, Shadi","This professor is great! His 152 lectures are flipped + he assigns short videos to watch before each lecture. This helped me easily follow along during the lectures. There are recitation quizzes each week but they are not hard at all and are mirrors of recitation group work. he ensures you don't rely on memorization. + there is a curve on final. | He's a very qualified and intelligent professor. That said, his class tailors itself to people who like to understand the math concept entirely as opposed to just the process. He uses a lot of analogies in order to explain mathematical concepts. I'd prefer a professor who does more examples in class. He grades harsher than other profs | He's a really good professor. He takes the time to explain concepts in 152 much better than the other calc professors. His assignments helped me understand the concepts well. | do not take this professor, he will make you hate math and your life | Heavy materials in short term. More materials included than other classes. | Linear algebra was easier than I expected, but he didn't present the material well. The book is good though. | His tests were hard, but he gave great notes and explained things clearly in class. I had calc 2 at a community college prior to taking this class, but put in a lot of work and still managed to do well. He's also really funny :) | Tough professor when it comes to exams and grades. However, he did teach the material well. Be ready to put forth some serious effort if you want a good grade. | There is a simple way to describe this guy: Average on the second exam was a 42, but a C started at 50. Basically, he will, and does, fail half of the class. Have fun! | Make no mistake, you have to actually put forth some effort, but that goes for just about any higher math course. Shadi's accent can be a little thick at times, put he's pretty coherent for the most part. Great teacher, provided you pay attention. | cool | Hard Professor but really good at what he does.One of the only professors Iv had who actually teach. He uses good examples and is funny in class. Overall a good professor but you really have to know your stuff to ace the exams. | Very thorough and he knows his math very well. He's sort of snobby but if you take your math studies seriously, he's a great teacher to work with. His exams are almost exactly like his quizzes. If you understand the concepts behind his quizzes, you have no excuse not to do well. | Excellent professor. He focuses on explaining the concepts very well. Uses funny analogies to explain mathematical ideas. He would jump around to explain how series work. I know many students dont like his class because its difficult. But guys come on, I doubt there's anyone else who would do a better job. I enjoyed his class. Good luck :) | hes horrible. tests are hard as all hell. for christsakes he asked to give him the derivative of a toaster on the first exam. what the hell kinda question is that. Most of his tests are essay. he doesnt explain anything. be smart dont take him | No Comments | Excellent professor. Always has a positive attitude towards assisting students. He knows his stuff really well. Focuses more on the concepts rather than how to solve every example on the board. Gives comprehensive explainations. By far the best math teacher/prof ive had. | Tough class and the exams are way harder than any other Calc 1 class but is a decent teacher and gives a good curve. The final is easy compared to his tests because it's written by the department. Definately go to lecture because test questions can be based on analogies he mentions in lecture. Overall, hard but he's a really nice guy and funny! | Hard tests... no question, but he really knows how to teach and make u understand calc. take if u wanna learn meaning behind calc. tests r hard, maybe hardest in department? but HUGE curve. I got an A | THIS IS THE WORST PROF EVER....if u have him, DROP....its hard to understand his accent, uses DUMB analagies to explain calc ""y is pregnant with x"", his exams are EXTREMELY hard...but since everyone does bad the curve is huge.. i managed to get a B | This guy knows his stuff, I'll give that much to him. The only problem is the way he teaches... he gives you easy examples and when he gives you exams, problems look a lot harder. Also, he makes you write a lot for the exams, which defeats the purpose of taking a MATH exam. Personally, I wouldn't recommend him. | EXAMS are really hard. but there is huge curve. hard to understand what he teaches. | the worst! | horrible..don't take him. ridiculously hard exams..the class avg for the 2nd midterm was 38/100...his curves r not too great either. i have never had anything less than B+ in calc classes, but this guy just wants to fail you. horrible teacher. | This guy is ridiculous. His exams are impossible. He's a tricky little ****. Avoid him at all costs. However, I somehow managed to pass. =) | Sucks | He is a great teacher, very clear and explains everything well. His exams are difficult, but the curve is amazing. I recommend him to everyone, he makes class interesting, and don't worry about difficult exams, mostly everyone will do poorly so the curve will be good. | he is a good professor and he's really fun and crazy sometimes | Shadi was an excellent professor that I enjoyed very much. | He's a good teacher but his exams are hard and he doesn't curve. Also his substitutes SUCK A55! After he comes back he has to reteach the material that the subs were supposed to do. Otherwise, he is a pretty good professor and his TA's ROCK. but I wouldn't take him again. | Nice guy and very clear. Exams are difficult, but the curve helps...i got an A in the class. | Nice teacher.Helpful during office hours. His exams were very difficult. It turns out there is probably a huge curve because i did alright relative to my exam grades. Do all the homeworks and get good grades on quizzes. Maple labs suck but every point counts. | I don't know what class you were in but the multivariable calc class I was in sucked. First exam was hard (he made it) and the second exam was easy (TA made it). Final was impossible. I left because I couldn't do any more of it after an hour and a half. Mind you I am a math major. | Exams were extremely easy, though the final was really difficult. Easy grader on maple labs. Gives plenty of example problems during class and provides practice exams and solutions. He's a funny guy during class. Very approachable."
"Alonso Lorenzo, Izar","Great prof. Sample problems class before the exam are exactly on the exam just different numbers. Curve was very generous, not sure why class averages were so low when she gives half the exam ahead of time, and low-point proofs. Just take notes from textbook, listen in lecture. Wish I actually went to lecture because she made the course a breeze. | She is the best in my opinion. She will live stream lectures on zoom. The review that she gives is the same as the exam just different numbers. Baozhi (TA) was amazing I would go in and spend the whole 3 hours doing lin alg and I went to her OO too. Ngl the only thing is her handwriting but she believed in me and told me not to give up.(no MATLAB!) | She was organized, however her handwriting is hard to read. Partial credit for exams is not very lenient, but the practice problems she gives are almost exactly like some problems on the exams. Her notes are also mainly copied from the textbook so you can skip lectures. I had more success going to the TA's office hours as it was more accessible. | Her lectures are very clear, and although the notes are illegible, they are well structured. The exam was difficult but the final mark was reasonable | Consistent schedule of homework with clear due dates and enough time to complete. Had trouble reading handwriting on lectures but overall effective. | Gives very good and clear lectures. Is open to questions and willing to help students succeed. Homeworks can be difficult but good practice for her exams which are much easier. She takes a lot of her lectures from the textbook and so it's easy to follow if you are lost, as she does not digitize her lectures. Cursive handwriting difficult to read."
"Benhamou, Tom","Honestly one of the greatest supply chain professor on campus, the tests are not easy and he is extremely knowledgeable in his field. The only way to pass this class is if you engage to better understand the material study groups also help tons and the test will be a breeze for you, you don't pass anything by giving the bare minimum. | What an amazing professor. One of the best professors that I have ever had. He gives amazing professional advice. Absorb his lectures. His tests are easy if you study. There is one group presentation. He picks random groups (about 4-5) to present. He doesn't grade some assignments and seems disorganized but I would take his class again. | Excellent class, presentation is the core of this class.A must take class, he gives great feed backs and insights. | He's pretty unorganized but overall a very smart guy who makes learning SCM interesting. | He may be Disorganized but he is very helpful, and has a lot of knowledge, easy going guy with a sense of humor. I enjoyed the class, even if you fail the midterm you can boost your grade up with the 2 papers and Group Project | Prof York is too is unorganized and he does not give back papers and allows a TA to marks tests without looking at them. Stay away from this teacher. He has lots of SCM knowledge but it can becomes too time consuming for a big class of over 100 students. | Sorry, I had to drop the class. First test given had nothing to do with what he teaches in class. He tells us to study the power point but (not a fair test). Avoid taking him.. you never know what your grade really is and I didn't want to take the chance until the end of the semester. Would never take him again. Good luck | Best Class ever. | There's a lot of work in class and the class is hard giving it's an introductory class. But the professor end up giving you good grades which you thought you didn't deserve (cause you scored low during the extremely tough exams, etc..). You actually learn stuff and the professor is memorable. | Nice professor, always available and willing to help students. Just need to structure better the course. Overall great person and teacher. | Professor York is a great guy, really is passionate about what he teaches, and fair. He cares how his students do in his class and goes out of his way to help them. Just study & ask questions he really does want everyone to learn, not a mean person at all. The material is a little difficult just stick with it. dont count on getting grades back tho | He has okay lectures and he often talks about his work experiences in his lectures, which is helpful. There's also a group project. He's very slow with handing back grades though. Doesn't give much info on case studies or assignments as well. You have to ask him in order for him to tell you | interactive professor. slides have minimal content and just short bullets--take notes. exams are hard. papers and case studies are given w.o guidance: 11font .75 margin 3 page single spaced. points for events & scm articles have no directions. doesn't answer e-mails. if you get to know him he's helpful with career advice. | Nice guy, pretty funny. loves to interact with the class so it keeps you awake. I had this class for a summer session and although there was a lot of material and assignments he grades very fairly so you'll do fine. | Stimulating class. Changed my major to Supply Chain because of class and professor. Hard but fun class | Stay away. Papers are 11 size no double spaced 3 pages. His instructions on papers/case studies make no sense. He never hands back papers. Gave us a syllabus mid semester. His exams are 3 pages. Mc/essays. He will not help you or respond to emails. | Great professor. Teaches the concepts very well. Tests are very fair. Cares about the students. Probably the best professor at Rutgers. | Loved this class. It was an 8:40 am and he managed to keep me awake. Anyone who says his class is hard didn't put any effort forth.. attend class, and understand the material on the slides-an A is possible. For his big project, he gives vague instructions, but if you email him, with questions he answers in great detail | He is not as easy as everyone says he is. His exams are straight from the slides and book. His instructions for the project and papers are vague. SIT IN THE BACK unless you like to be called out every class. I would suggest taking another SCM professor. He is one of my least favorite professors in the business school | make sure to write down everything he says in class and you will do well | He is a great speaker. It is not an easy class, however A is very possible. There are 2 exams, homework, 3 one page papers, and one 3 page paper (all papers are single spaced), there is also a group project. Make sure to study at least 5 days before each exam as there is plenty to memorize. Taking good notes is essential to doing well."
"Urtiaga Erneta, Inigo","Terrible professor. If charnley is an option take it with him. The prof sucks at grading and teaching. He teaches you using the definitions/theorems instead of examples. The only good part about this class is that you get cheat sheets. Save urself the trouble though and you'll thank urself for not having diff eq with him. | He is an awful lecturer who provides barely any examples and makes differential equations harder than it actually is. You're better off learning from the textbook because his lectures are pretty much useless. He does upload his notes but have fun understanding what is written. I would avoid this professor if possible. | I took Professor Erneta for 244 and he is a very nice guy and does a good job with explaining the concepts. He does upload his notes in case you missed lecture, but they are a bit messy. The tests were relatively challenging and he's a pretty strict grader, but he does allow cheat sheets for his exams."
"Spiro, Samuel","Good instructor for Math 373 online! | Dr. Cogar is such a great lecturer. He really makes sure that you understand the material. There is not much homework, but the final project can be kind of annoying. He sort of assumes that you understand how to write MATLAB code, which is not a prerequisite for the course. Despite that, I would definitely take Dr. Cogar again! | I can't stress enough how great Professor Cogar was for calculus 2. He is good and I would take him again if I could. | Amazing professor. Teaches really well and gives good feedback for your work. | Getting a C+ yet still liking the professor speaks a lot. Cogar is nerdy that he is cutely admirable. Cogar is hilarious. Cogar helped me understand a subject that I had so much struggle in. In the end, I blame the fact that class was hard was because of the math department. Give Cogar a chance. | Prof. Cogar's lecture is clear, patient, interesting, and well-organized. He makes sure everything he teaches is well-motivated, and he never seems impatient when someone asks him to re-explain a concept. He relates the content to funny historical context or his own research, making you want to learn more. He is a treasure to Rutgers. Take his clas | Had Prof Cogar for Math 300, which people usually consider a difficult course, but Prof Cogar made it very manageable due to his amazing teaching skills. He also gives a very reasonable amount of homework, which I think more profs should do instead of just bombarding students with ton of homework. Hands down, one of the best profs I have had. | Dr. Cogar has been the best professor I have ever had. He is passionate about what he teaches, and he does a great job conveying information for a rather difficult course. I believe his averages for both midterms were higher than the other professors. He manages to make a difficult and boring subject quite the opposite. 10/10 | Great professor, I had him for calculus 2 and I am very lucky for this. He is funny, caring, and genuinely wants to teach students calculus. As long as you go to lecture every time and listen to him intently, then you will definitely pass. Of course since Calc 2 is a difficult course, you will NEED to study an hour every day in days before midterm. | Very helpful outside of class and goes slow enough in lecture so you can follow difficult material more easily. You can tell that he's genuinely excited about the material, which allows him to communicate it better. Sometimes goes off on funny little tangents that make class easier to get through, especially during early morning lectures."
"Chan, Swee Hong","Doesn't put in any grades into canvas until the semester is completely over. He hasn't put in a single grade yet. Nobody knows what they have in class which is crazy. Good lecturer overall tho | very professional and fair. He is very good at what he's teaching. However, lectures can be hard to understand. But he will answer any questions asked in class. If you email him, he will definitely answer. | The rare professor who actually believes in the beauty of their subject. I am taking a graduate course from him, and his love for the subject is infectious. Makes me want to prove hard theorems so that maybe he'd nod approvingly. Interestingly, he is teaching a course that he has indeed shaped in many ways. Hence, offers interesting anecdotes. | Another hidden legend! If you want to really learn Calc 3 and keep an open mind this is your guy. He puts a lot of effort in his lectures and helps make the material click. You may not understand everything the first time, just keep reenforcing and practicing - comes together in the end. Doesn't give much required hw, makes math interesting | No Sakai page, pretty bad at explaining things. | The others who rated Professor chanillo for this semester's 251 are seriously salty lol. I thought he was an amazing lecturer who always made the concepts click. He must've given a great curve, I did very well on the two exams but bombed the final and still managed an A for the course. I'll be looking to take him for any future math courses. | AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! WORST PROFESSOR AT RU. He can't even give a proper lecture without it being confusing. He tries to crack jokes in class, but they are so bad that they make me cringe. I regret taking him when there were so many other choices. Does not provide practice exams either and doest know how to even use sakai properly. | Don't take this guy. Awful lecturer, had no idea what was going on. His exams are extremely hard and is worded in length. First time ever I failed Calculus. And from my understanding, Calc 3 was supposed to be very easy. | Worst Professor I have ever had. Awful teaching style. Doesn't explain anything on the board, simply does problems without context. Do yourself a favor and SWITCH OUT OF HIS SECTION IMMEDIATELY. | His teaching style is superb. Does numerous examples and asks the class if he should do more examples. Goes over everything thoroughly. Material on tests is not a surprise - you know what's gonna come. His accent can be hard to get used to in the first few classes, but he clarifies well on the board. Tough subject, but genuinely good teacher. | Superb! | Awful professor, very condescending, rude, not very helpful, could barely understand him. | I did poorly on mid-term 1 in Math 421, but Prof. Chanillo really helped me a lot in office hours. One on one he is very patient and encouraging. He also gave out a checklist, a sample final and held a 2 hour review session. You need to be mature to take this class, and you have to be serious. I got a B overall in the course. | He's a great lecturer and teaches the material very well. His exams are extremely difficult compared to any other Calc V class. Averages were in the 40's. He puts on ridiculous complicating problems on the exam, stuff never covered in class or in the homework and expects to figure it out on your own. STRONGLY RECOMMEND going to an easier teacher. | Worst professor I've ever had. He's extremely unfair and his grading is very harsh. He makes you feel stupid when you don't know something and makes sarcastic remarks to his students. His exams are insanely hard and our averages were about 30 points lower than averages in other calc 5 classes. Do yourself a favor and switch out immediately! | This man is the first professor ive taken who truly exemplifies academia. He will push to learn, send you a flurry of emails reinforcing the material, and yes he may crack a joke when someone asks something without thinking. Class is much harder than most other Calc V classes, but totally worth it regardless of the final grade. | This course is hard, but Chanillo tries his best. The textbook isn't great, and his boardwork is meh, and that's where most of the difficulty lies. But if you go to this guy for help he's very willing to take the time to explain stuff to you. Also a funny guy. (Everyone who felt offended by him in class, swallow your ego and pipe down.) | Not too helpful in making sure students understand material. Its hard to straighten out things that you don't understand the first time, so pay attention and study with a friend. He is not too good at answering questions, but he is a nice guy. I do not recommend this professor. | Not that hard of a class. Just do the hw problems and you will be alright. I barely went to class and I would just study the day before and did pretty decent...However, he needs to work on his attitude. Everyone is scared to ask questions in class because he usually responds with, ""ITS OBVIOUS! HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE IT.."" and then he'll try to explai | As far as I know, he is a good teacher(just for Math250). He makes u understand how the material you have learned is used in real world. | his exams are difficult. if u do ur work, try, and come to class u can do well. | Impossibly hard, yes, but not a terrible teacher. Tests were largely proof-based (even the problems that seem like computation require a proof!--remember this!) and doing well in 300 and 250 does not mean you will do well in his 350. It seems as though he does curve, however; so just be better than the average. | This guys terrible. All he does is stand up, quickly go through the proofs and says every step is ""obvious."" You can't assume the grader knows anything for his exams and he takes off points everywhere. Kinda arrogant and constantly says ""This isn't Math 250, you have to show your work."" blah blah blah. Avoid at all costs, I hated him. | he makes you feel really stupid if you ask questions, and then gets mad when students dont ask any questions. definitely ask your TA if you have questions, not him. | I went to classes when I could but didnt usually last the entire 80minutes. Hope you get a good TA and go to tutoring or something. You wonted be able to pass this class on lecture alone. Math blows in general, so the chances of anyone liking any calc teacher is slim to none. | wow this is the most F'd up proff. he doesnt teach well. he seems to hold a grudge against high school calc teachers and constantly brings them up saying how they dont know****. DO NOT ever raise your hand in the class and ask him a question bcuz he will make you feel so stupid. he doesnt help at all. if you can get out of this class get out! | Worst teacher at Rutgers. He assigns many hw problems and doesn't tell you which ones are going to be graded. Exams are extremely difficult(class got 20s on 2nd exam). He has ZERO compassion for students. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with him. Switch sections immediately!! | No Comments | Typical day in class: student asks a question to better understand something, Chanillo doesn't answer (or if he does, makes student feel dumb for asking). Then complains students don't ask questions. Huh? I you're gonna take this class with him, know this: he loves to stick questions on the exams from sections in the book not done in class! | Chanillo is not a great prof but I wouldn't call him mean, arrogant, or anything like that. He does tend to get very furstrated quickly with students who are apathetic and do not pain attention during class. If students do not speak up he automatically assumes the class doesn't know. I can see if you have a hard time with math he isn't great thou | Such. A. Jerk. | Apathetic and condescending sums him up. | His tests are neither difficult nor easy. His lectures are good - you can learn everything w/out reading the book much. However, when you go for office hours to ask question or help with hw problems, he is not helpful at all. | I should have listened to others' comments. This guy is so arrogant. He is a good professor as far as his teaching goes, but you really need to class to be able to follow what is going on. However he is a total jerk when it comes to asking any questions. he just makes you feel stupid. | this guy is so cocky and mean. dont ever ask questions in his class he'll try and make you feel dumb. transfer from his class | I don't know what experiences other people rating him had with him. However, he is great in teaching I have never looked for outside help for math 252. Actually, he makes everything clear for you. | Whoa! Evil man. He won't help you and has an awful attitude. If you get him...drop him, do not pass go...do not collect$200..immediately register for another section!!! | No Comments | This guy is extremely unhelpful and needs an attitude adjustment. I should have listened when I heard ""OMG, you have him?! He's the devil!"" Avoid him like the plague."
"Kwon, Heeyoung","Everybody was so uptight about her because she had a thick accent, but it wouldn't make or break you. The TA helped a lot, and all the prof. wanted to do was pass everyone and she did! Her exams were so easy, straight from the examples on the slides, everybody complained for no reason.... | She is very shy and quiet, and has a significant accent which makes it hard to understand her, plus she second guesses her own answers to questions and often contradicts the textbook. The TA is the key to this course because it's really not difficult work, it just needs clarity. | I was skeptical at first about her bc it is hard to understand her speak at times but she's a good teacher and is upfront- no surprises. Overall she's a good teacher and I would recommend her class. | Great professor very easy if she knows who you are she grades very easy, its impossible to get anything less than an A. | had to teach myself everything in this course because it is so hard to understand her. never responds to any questions a student has because she can not speak english. who the HELL would hire someone who doesn't speak english to teach a 4-credit college course??? R U SCREW."
"Bhuyan, Sue","I dont know what people are complaining about she was an amazing teacher. Very clear, spoke well, taught well, I would highly recommend her to others. You will probably not find an better calc teacher. Her exams were challenging but not too bad. You will definitely learn a lot. | Basically agree with everything that was said. She really was willing to help me when I was struggling and did everything in her power to make sure I passed (still don't know my final grade). She's a great teacher for a grad student and really chill and a small class size was really beneficial. | Basically agree with everything that was said except no comment on the hot thing cause I'm a chick. She really was willing to help me when I was struggling and did everything in her power to make sure I passed (still don't know my final grade). She's a great teacher for a grad student and really chill and a small class size was really beneficial. | She is really nice and really helpful. The only down side is that she can be a bit unorganized in managing the class with homework and stuff which is a bit annoying but when it comes to the material she really knows her stuff. Calculus is hard no matter what but I highly recommend her. She is also not too hard on the eyes.... ;-) | She's will answer all of your questions and will set aside time for u if u email her or go to her office hours. The only problem is that there is little to no communication between her and Dr.Beck. Since what he teaches is not in the book some recitations she has no clue unless someone shows her and does it a different way which can be confusing | She's a mess | Made math very applicable. She had a genuine interest in helping you do well and kept regular office hours. I would definitely take a class with here again. | Topics in Math for Liberal Arts! UGH!! This class is extremely boring but Prof Durst mad it fun and more interesting and applied it to evryday life. She was very helpful and held weekly study sessions at her office. she really wanted everyone to do well and was a very fair grader. LOVED HER!! | You can tell she's new at teaching because she stumbles a bit and she's made a couple of mistakes that she corrected the next day, but it's nothing that a little experience can't fix. She's incredibly helpful, she tries really hard, and clearly wants to help you pass."
"Ferguson, Brent","I repeat do not even look to choose him as your professor, awful | Ruined my semester! the exams were completely different than his class. The lectures were a horrible representation of the difficulty of the class! I heavily relied on the homework to pass. | After already taking precalc and calc and doing well in them in high school, this class was wayyyy harder than it should have been. Didn't help prepare for tests at all. I learned way more from the recitation professor. I only did fairly well in the class because I already knew a lot of the stuff. | The class was very difficult overall. Half of the tests he created were on things we hardly learned and extremely difficult. No study guide was given to prepare for tests. The first half of the semester, him and the recitator weren't on the same page at all. | Terrible---- | Worst teacher, does not give study guides, you learn more from recitation then the actual lectures, destined to fail | Not an enjoyable experience. We were not prepared for the final at all. Exam averages fell in the 50s and 60s all semester. | OMG! WORST PROFESSOR EVER! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! literally will go on random tangents during class. The first 5 weeks or so he started class telling everyone to drop the class. Barely did anything in class, he told random stories for the first 45 minutes of class anyways. sweet person and cares for his students but not a good professor. | terrible course, terrible teaching, boring"
"Goswami, Rashmika","She was really nice, if you missed a deadline (for actual reasons), she would be very willing to push it back. She has no accent. Only assignments were homework and recitation quiz besides actual exams. lectures not mandatory, she posts her written notes after every one."
"Queiroz Velter, Mariana","Mariana is extremely nice and passionate about her subject. The material is very interesting and fun to learn, however she skims over slides VERY quickly, and grades VERY tough on her exams. Make sure you are doing all the assigned reading and taking careful notes about things that may not even seem important. | A great and caring professor, she really cares about students and the learning environment of the class. She loves the topic and is very passionate so it makes lectures more fun. All exams and quizzes are online to do over the weekend and open notes making them very easy. She is a generous grader and attendance in part of the grade. | Her lectures were very captivating and even though I had no prior knowledge of art history, I learned so much from her class. She is a passionate and kind professor who allowed us to think about societal evolution in a new light. She cares about her students and her studies, and it shows. I have recommended this class to all of my friends. | Prof. Guzman is one of the sweetest humans I've met so far. You can tell she is genuinely excited about what she is teaching, and is stoked to talk about art and what it means. Her class shows so much about art, and you'll not only learn tons of genuinely interesting stuff. Attendance is graded, and some of the quizzes are mean. But shes the best."
"Du, Jishen","He's a good professor. Explained linear algebra in a good way and there was weekly homework that wasn't too bad. He also has a great sense of humor so lecture is never that boring. I would highly recommend taking him. | Overall great professor. Class is not too difficult and the weekly homework is moderate. Exams are not bad as long as you read the textbook and do the homework. Greate sense of humour as well. Highly recommend. Never a dull moment. | Professor Dul explained things excellently. Intro To Linear Algebra does require you to train yourself to think a little differently in comparison to the Calculus sequence. Professor Dul made the transition easy, was very accessible outside of class, and his exams were easy provided you participated and read the textbook. Would highly recommend."
"Bahri, Mohamed El Hedi","He cares a lot about his students and he is very easy to reach out to. His lectures are very informative, but more on the conceptual side than the problem solving side, which is i guess what recitation is for. He is very approachable and kind but the example problems he does in class are sometimes hard to follow because he makes it up on the spot | Mohamed is a very nice professor who is responsive to students and goes into incredible detail during lectures. My main criticism is he picks unnecessarily complicated example problems where he spends more time figuring out how to do them rather than teaching. As his first class, he's probably just learning what works for him. Overall great."
"Wang, Jianxiong","She was always so caring and attentive to students. I came into linguistics with no knowledge and was easily able to fly through the class. The topics were really easy/ accessible! You genuinely don't really have to pay attention in class. She had weekly hw assignments (dropped lowest two) which were very easy and open note exams. Highly recommend! | Easy A. Some parts were interesting. Don't really need to pay attention to do well. Tests were really easy. Weekly assignments but she drops your lowest two. Passionate about linguistics. Can be a bit boring at times but she's really nice and cares about her students. | Great professor! Online/open note exams. Really assists students and always answers emails and is available for extra help. She does have a heavy accent, though, but overall reccommend!"
"Leung, Wing Hong","He cares that students understand the topics and will backtrack and reexplain until everyone understands them. Responds to emails very quickly. The class was fast-paced, but Chun really helps guide everyone to an A."
"Goonetilleke, Las","Very unorganized, grades extremely slowly, can not understand lectures, and is very unhelpful in general. | He was a good professor. Explained the topics very well, but handwriting can sometimes be sloppy. The homework can be tedious and requires a lot of work, but it is doable. The exams were fair: open-ended was easy, but MCQ can be tricky. Fortunately, he gets the MCQ from the textbook and previous midterms. Pay attention in class, and you'll do well. | He is a good person but not a good professor. To pass this course all you need to do is do all suggestions questions and write your homework and quiz carefully. If you don't do that, you will never get pass. | Great professor that explains everything well. Could tell he cares about his students and will make time for you especially in office hours. Does grade a little slow but his exams are all very straight forward and are fairly easy as long as you do the review. Most people shouldn't have trouble with this class. I had a tough schedule and I was fine | He's an extremely kind and caring dude with EXTREMELY straight forward open ended portions for exams. The multiple-choice gets tricky, but studying the slides he uploads provides sufficient practice. Extremely accessible in office hours and understanding of external circumstances. Only flaw is slow grading due to terrible TA's. | insanely slow grader so youll never know how youre doing, has unnecessarily hard multiple choice questions, goes through material way faster than the other professors, can barely understand him during lecture, his handwriting is almost unreadable, and never even posted the solutions final exam guide. but hey hes a nice guy. take any other prof. | We didn't get our midterm grade until after we took the next one. Didn't have most grades when we took the final. Had to beg for answers to exam guides. Never responds to emails. TA just forwards email to Professor who doesn't respond. Super disorganized. | Easily one of the most disorganized + confusing professors I've ever had. Does not explain content concisely or clearly, slides are copy pasted from the textbook + not easily understandable for someone new to the material (many unfixed formatting errors too). Class frequently corrects his mistakes. Takes month+ for grades. Extremely lazy professor. | Really easy class. His lectures were pretty helpful but if you don't wanna show up you can just self-learn the material. You learn basically no theory and he'll actively avoid explaining any theory. It's a computational class and the final is basically all computations and remembering specific things. | I loved Professor Goonetilleke. He was just amazing, he taught Linear Algebra in a way that was very easy to understand. Whenever I had extenuating circumstances that came about because of life, work, or whatever, he was always understanding, and almost always granted me extensions. Possibly the nicest Professor at Rutgers. | Posting this review before any grades have been assigned. This professor is the most uninspiring teacher I have had at Rutgers. He reads straight from the textbook and makes many mistakes per lecture, often relying on students to correct his mistakes. He is unable to deliver big-picture insights. Steer clear if you are looking to learn! | He was very clear in his lectures, straightforward and was open to clarify anything to students who did not understand. Best Calculus professor that I've had. | Takes so long to answer emails, takes a month to grade midterms, hard to understand in class. Hard to want to attend his lectures when they are so monotone and uninspirational. Only plus is that the exams are mostly multiple choice. | I took him for Calc 244 and he is genuinely one of the best professors I have had so far. All of his test material is directly from lecture so I recommend going to them. He does take a while to grade the exams and the recitations quizzes can be hard but he prepares you well for them. | Lectures went over proofs and examples. His section covers a lot of material from the textbook but the final is worth 24% of your grade which is better than some other sections which have it as 35% or 40% of your grade. Attendance was taken at the most random times. | Great prof. C4 was pretty easy overall and he made his exams pretty easy too. His lectures are great but you don't NEED to go to class to do well in his class. The material for the most parts follows the slides he uploads and can be self taught thru textbooks. If u wanna do well in his class just do a couple practice problems after each day. | This is the best Linear Algebra professor you could take. He truly understands linear algebra concepts and tries his best to get you to understand them. He is a great professor and a very cool guy, although he does take a while to grade.Your final grade is mostly based on 3 midterms + final. He is also willing to work with you to improve your grade | He was the best math lecturer I've ever had; he made Lin Al interesting and fun. Test are easy, study guide prep you well. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you want a good grade it is. Quizes are hard and will bring down your grade a little. Test take months to grade. I just received my Exam 3 and Final grades yesterday | Professor Goonetilleke really did a good job explaining material. Homework and exams were fair. I enjoyed him as a professor but he took FOREVER to grade exams. Each exam took over a month to get back, and we would be taking another exam before seeing the previous one's grade. We took the final a week ago and still don't have our grades for exam 3. | Goonetilleke is a great professor. I would recommend going to lectures as he helps you understand the topics very well. His quizzes are pretty hard but his exams are fairly easy. My class had 3 midterms and 1 final. | Reads the slides, Very Hard quizzes, but has easy exams and easy class overall. Often removes the penalty of late submissions if you show some interest | Good at teaching the material and a fair grader. Study suggested homework problems and attend lecture. | Lectures were a repeat of the textbook almost word for word. Very little explanation or examples. Took very very long to grade anything. At any cost take this course with a different professor. Test difficulty varied greatly, incorrectly grading most students' tests. Good luck getting in contact with him outside of class | Matlab homework is very easy and basically free points, and lectures are organized and well taught. That being said, he takes forever to grade his exams, which is frustrating. He is also way more conceptual than other lin alg professors, so his exams and quizzes are harder. | Do not take Differential Equations with this professor. Has weekly quizzes that are averaged at the end of the semester. Has three midterms, and a final. Midterms aren't too bad if you study, final was ok. If you put the time to study outside of class the topics, you should be fine with the course. Lies about grading midterms, took a month to grade | His class can be said to be the simplest. homework depends on self-consciousness as long as you finish it daily. The first three mid-term exams were all questions after the textbook. Although final is a bit difficult, if the previous chapters have a good foundation, final will not become very bad. | Awful professor. goes faster than any other 250 section. He also gives theoretical weekly quizzes which other sections don't even have. He also posts everything late, will constantly lie about when he'll post exam grades. Super boring lectures and is terrible at explaining concepts. Highly recommend you avoid this prof. | I think that Professor Goonetilleke is a nice professor who understands the course material very well, but he is bad at explaining the concepts. Also, it's been 45/46 days since I took my second midterm and I still didn't get my grade back. Try to avoid him, because he is SO disorganized, as he posts announcements way later than expected to. | Despite, getting an A in this course I would recommend no one actually take this professor. He will post everything super later. You will have weekly quizzes that no other class will have. He will never post a single assignment on time and in general, the methods he teaches during lectures are now allowed on the exam. | He's okay at teaching but he's really disorganized. Posts our quizzes late all the time, takes a month to grade our exams (does he not have graders or something?), posts our homework late all the time. Also, his exams and quizzes asks a lot of conceptual questions that aren't really gone over in class. Don't recommend. | As someone who has always been good at math, linear algebra is harder and more conceptual. Goone does a good job at teaching it and he's always willing to explain things if you ask. If you have trouble with concepts I recommend going to office hours. Tests can be hard, they have T/F questions and a couple of proofs. Overall, good prof, hard class. | Weekly 15 min quizzes (grade is 25% for each of 2 exams, 30% for final, 10% HW, 10% quizzes). The suggested HW is long but the stuff you actually have to turn in is only like 5 problems each week. Pretty low amount of workload for a math class. Exam averages were 64, 72, and 67 (final). Syllabus says no curves but I got an 87 and they gave me an A. | Good professor but sometimes he's a bit hard to understand because of his accent and the way he talks. Exams are pretty hard. Quizzes are even rougher b/c curveballs. Not much homework, but its highly recommended you do the extra problems or you won't understand the chapters. Pretty generous curve at the end, he rounded my grade by like 3% | He is an okay professor. The homework he assigns are not too helpful for the exam. Be prepared to self-study from the textbook. | Goone's class was alright. Compared to other reviews I read in the beginning of my semester with him, I would say that they were pretty accurate. You definitely have to work and study to get an A. I had to self-apply and self-study for most of the lessons to grasp the material. His grading is pretty fair. Workload, quizzes, and exams are decent. | Professor Goon is widely known as the easy 250 Professor, but he really changed since my brother had him 5 years ago. His exams are ridiculously hard. Impossible conceptual questions. Your whole grade is exams because theres barely any hw or quizzes. Please dont take him. I worked hard and it didnt pay off, his exams are that hard. | Very old-fashioned; you read the textbook and are ""advised"" to do all the review problems, but aren't given credit for any of that work. 75% of your final grade is test-based. I was in an online section that Goonetilleke was not qualified for: he just doesn't know how to use the learning platform, and we all suffered for it. | I liked him but I found the exams to be very unfair. I would highly suggest someone else. I am not one of those students who doesnt work hard, I studied for 4-6 hours a day, and still got a C on the last exam. If you do the practice problems it will help, but save yourself the struggle and pick a better professor. | Possibly the worst lecturer I have ever had to learn from. Takes simple concepts and twists them to somehow make them more complicated. Doesn't teach off of a textbook and his slides/ notes are riddled with typos and raise more questions than they answer. Only thing good is that his exams are easy and grading is relatively chill. | My boy! A very finorminal teacher. I thought Linear Algebra was a hard course and didn't do as good but he was very helpful and caring considering we were going through a pandemic and was very nice with me alone when I went to office hours and he makes a lot of mistakes while grading exams, but overall, he has a good sense of humor and is funny. | He didnt grade our exams, an anon. grader does it. He emails back quickly. The lectures are quite dull, if you know how to do all the hw and look at your exams for your final review, youre most likely going to get a B+/A on the final (35-40%), he gave us a 2% overall final grade ec assignment. The hws are super easy (no more than an hr a week). | He's really understanding and genuinely cares about his students and whether or not they learn during his class. He is easy to reach out to and sympathizes a lot with his students so if you are unable to give a quiz or turn in homework late do not need to worry provided you have a valid reason. | Descent professor who genuinely cares about students learning as he always ensured that all questions were answered and steps/results in his examples are correct. However, too much of lecture was dedicated to going over proofs that were never necessary. He gives weekly quizzes that were sometimes tricky, however do a good job at reviewing material. | This professor deserves multiple 5 stars. Fall 2020 in his class was amazing. He gave us so much extra credit and freebies near the end of the semester. Pretty good lectures too. | I did very poorly on the first exam, but the professor met with me one on one to talk about how I could improve. He makes a TON of mistakes grading quizzes and tests so make sure you go through every question to make sure he graded accurately. he is a kind prof and wanted everyone to succeed. He gave us extra credit and was fair with his exams/hw. | Bro! You just can't say no to a 40 percent take home for final. Sometimes the weekly quizzes are annoying, but it is actually good that you are forced to re-study the old material per week. tbh, I didn't do any suggested hw, only the TF, they def help alot. | Relatively fair professor overall, but sometimes was less enthusiastic than I hoped. Do the suggested HW problems and pay attention in class and you should be ok; I shouldn't have put it off as long as I did or could have done better. Also he was sometimes very late to respond to emails. Nonetheless, not a bad choice and I'd recommend. | He is an awesome professor and his exams are pretty straight forward if you pay attention to his lectures and do suggested HW problems then you can easily get a good grade. | If you do HW and suggested textbook problems this class is an easy A. | This class was not too hard at first. Just when I thought it was manageable then it gets way harder after the second midterm and I didnt do well on the final. Because he gives no curves I dont think this is fair to give us an final thats way harder than the practice and expect us to be prepared. You really need to do all the homework problem! | Professor Goonetilleke wants you to succeed, but it's up to you to put in the work. You have to go to lectures, do the suggested homework problems, and do the exam reviews. I don't recommend trying to skip and teach from the textbook. Exams are straightforward if you pay attention, he explains concepts well, and is awesome in office hours. | He is truly the best. He is amazing at giving lectures, he gives detailed explanations, and he goes over example problems, and make sure that the students understand the material fully. Take him!! | He's the true MVP, the second exam was a blessing. S/o to everyone who took his Spring 2020 Linear Alg class. If u do all of the hw repeatedly, u'll be fine. His instructions on exams have similar instructions from the book, just in case if wording trips you up. His selected hw (that u have to submit)& the quizzes give u insight to q's on exams | I could understand concepts in easier and organized fashion through his lecture. Homework problems are optional but I would highly recommend to do those problems and review problems that he posts on the Canvas since his exams are similar to such problems. Since there is no curve in this class, make sure to try best on every exams. | Hes a tough but fair grader. Its great that he posts practice exams with answer keys so you can study before exams. If you ask questions in class hell clearly answer them but if no one asks any questions he wont repeat stuff and just move on to the next topic. | Lectures are incredibly dry (especially since it's a lot of theory as an intro course), so don't be shocked if you start drifting asleep). But he's a straightforward professor. He posts lecture slides, so review those, do the textbook problems, and Dr. Z's online practice. No curves, but he's a very fair grader. | Great Professor for DiffEq. Midterms were a little bit challenging. He made the final easy tho bc of the low exam 2 avg.. For each exam he gave us a study guide telling us what we should focus on, which helped out a lot and made studying easier. Definitely use those, Dr.Z notes, and Paul's Online math notes and your set for this class. | Good professor for DiffEq, not as easy as people make it out to be (does series/numerical methods that other profs leave out) but still doable. Gave tough midterms so made up for it by giving out an easy final. TA can make/break the class. | He's a very nice teacher, and the exams are very straightforward. He doesn't really give partial credit and doesn't curve the class, so make sure you do very well on the exams and assignments. | Overall an average Calc teacher. It is hard to understand what he rights on the board and is not very good at answering questions. Exams are tough but fair. | Las is a great professor who teaches to the textbook. His tests are fair, although you should look at examples in the textbook before tests. | Las is a clear professor, and he explains things very well. The only setback is that his class is very passive, he doesn't usually ask questions to the class. Also, if you took Calc 1 before he's a little slow, but understandably, the assumption is that you're coming to this class from Precalc. I thoroughly enjoyed him, he clearly cares. | His lectures are okay if u try your best understanding his accent. Exams are tough, way more difficult than the assignments. I hated the TA though. | Lectures are very helpful and simple to understand since he has slides. Take advantage of the online quizzes because they prepare you for the exams. As long as you attend lecture and pay attention, this class is easy. | It is so difficult to understand what he says, no offense. He explains everything in a way that is so much more complicated than it has to be. Though it may be useful for some, many of the people I know in the class struggles to grasp what is being taught. | I really liked Dr. Goonetilleke's class. It was very straight forward and an easy A. As long as you show up to class and did the homework, linear algebra is not a hard class. | This is coming from a math major. He goes extremely fast in the lecture! He does give you study guides before the exam, which is somewhat similar to the actual exam and when he explains the concepts, its extremely confusing how he explains it. And do not take Matlab with him because he doesn't accurately clarify what he wants . | No extra credit or curve in this class. Very straightforward, the class before his exams, he holds a review day. Go to those, and it is the same as the exams. He is extremely straightforward and his exams are very fair. I think he is the easiest 250 prof, so take him! Just do the hw, and follow his slides, and you can get a B or an A. No Curve!!!!! | There is no curve in this class. He is very straightforward and his HW and lectures are basically the exams. Do the HW, don't let the material add up. It's really not that hard. Use Dr.Z's Lin Alg Notes to do well, it's harder than his exams. Goonetilleke is considered one of the easier teachers. Take him! You will do well if you put in some work. | He's a great teacher makes everything very doable. He only gives assignments that will improve your performance on exams and is very straightforward."
"Sinapova, Dima","I took this class to knock off a requirement for data science since all the other classes were full, and this class is no joke. Her lectures make no sense and the class is very difficult with her. The midterms weren't bad but the final is so difficult (40% of your grade). I thought I was good at math, but this class taught me otherwise. | As someone who has never studied linearly algebra, matrices, or vector spaces before, this was a great introductory class to it all, started from the fundamentals and slowly worked up to more complex topics, tests were very fair as there were practice review problems given similar to the exam, overall great class and great professor!"
"Nair, Gokul","Dr. Kadel is a very caring guy, but he is not always good at getting his point across. He cares about his students, but his grading does not always make sense. His in class tests usually cover info not gone over ever. There is also an online test/quiz/exam for every in class one scheduled. | Lectures are long but usually does not cover all of the material. He does homework through an online program, though the program is sometimes wrong. Will test on material not gone over. Will not work with students if answers are correct but was some kind of misunderstanding. Not always responsive through emails. | His lectures are terrible and very lengthy. He does his homework through MyOpenMath which messes up a lot. You will take a test over material you haven't covered yet. There will ALWAYS be a ""pre"" test before the test on MyOpenMath even midterms and finals. Which may seem handy but you usually fail the tests because you haven't learned any of it. | Lectures a lot, homework is online and there are often issues with the system. MyOpenMath sometimes grades the assignment incorrectly or does not give you full credit and he will not fix the grade. Most of the learning happens through youtube, so prepare to be confused. | I was skeptical when taking his class after seeing his rating. However; this guy is awesome. If you go to class, use his office hours, and do the homework, you'll do fine. | Great guy, not so great teacher. I took Kadel for Elementary Calculus, and regretted it. He really is so nice and caring. However, he is horrible at explaining and getting his point across. Homework is on mymathlab, and there are many problems that you will easily spend 1+ hours on (LITERALLY). His tests look nothing like the examples he gives. | He is a good teacher. But he's not clear on when test will be and how many you will only have about 2 test the whole semester and does all homework on my math lab which is helpful but don't buy the book you will never use it. Overall he explains well and is a good teacher. I would just like set dates for test and what they will be over."
"Rao, Zhenghao","It's true, as stated earlier, that the TA was very bad indeed. In the final review class, he had a problem where he listed the equation but couldn't know how to calculate it. Instead, he went and blamed the professor for teaching it the wrong way. It's just a matter of simple calculating.All I can say is it's a good thing he's not one of our prof. | I have to say that the ta is really terrible. Going on recitation is no longer expected to learn anything! The only thing he can do is just hand out quiz to us. Like, for example, in the midterm review class, can you imagine him spending an entire class on just two questions? The time it took my friend and I to already finish a set of paper. | He sends revision summaries and practice papers before the exams. The content of the exam is similar to these. Sometime It may be a little more flexible, but if you complete his hw and revision papers you will be fine. | This professor was very patient and understanding. After class if you had any questions he was very kind and clear in his explanations. During class he has a clear note. For every new concept introduced, he would attach many examples to help you understand. | Probably the worst calc teacher I've ever had. Hard to understand at first but i guess you get used to him. No class engagement at all. He has no idea how to teach a class and the entire class had to self teach ourselves. Even our TA was explaining how disorganized he is. Midterms were horrible and finals were worse. NEVER take this professor!!!"
"Carlen, Eric","Good professor and a nice grader, but I'm not sure how the final grades were exactly determined. Very good lectures that you definitely want to show up to. His course notes are pretty good too. | Carlen is probably the most best lecturer I've had at Rutgers. This man is like criminally insane, he wrote the textbook we used for the course WHILE teaching the course. The notes go into the most theoretically difficult math i've done considering the prereqs for this course are only 244. Amazing prof but a hard class. Take 300 or 350 prior. | Tough class. Especially if you have a traditional computation-based background. Expect to learn a lot but also work hard. If you already took calc III in high school this is easy. Fair grader. Do not take unless you are serious about Math. Highly recommended to take this course along with Math 300H. Textbooks reads like lectures but with mistakes | His lectures go so fast that he inadvertently skips letters in long words. The book is a typo-ridden PDF that he wrote himselfand updated many times during the semesterand it reads just like his lectures, so if you struggle to follow in class, the textbook won't help. Some material was even too abstract for my tutor, a 4th year math grad student. | Tests are hard, but curves are amazing. (0-49 C, 50-74 B, 75+ A for my semester) Homework questions are difficult, and if you have trouble understanding, go to his office hours, and ask him about the question. Lectures move very quickly. | 291 is a tough class, and the lectures are very confusing. I got a lot out of reading the book and doing the textbook problems. I struggled through the first exam because I didn't do the textbook questions, but I used the textbook for the 2nd exam&final and with his generous partial credit I was able to get an A. Expect to work very hard. | If you love math and proofs, you'll like this class. But if you just need to take a Calc 3 class, take 251 instead. Lectures are long and hard to follow; homework is impossible. Don't bother reading the textbook. There are two exams and a final, all of which are very heavily curved. As long as you kind of know what you're doing, you'll get an A. | Professor Carlen is brilliant. 291251h251; expect to be challenged & get smarter. At first his lectures proved to be dense, fast, & proof based & it'll be hard to keep up mentally but if you belong in 'big girlboy math' you'll get to his speed. HW is long at first but you get use to it. He's my fav, wish more prof like him, says funny things 2! | Professor Carlen is a brilliant mathematician, but I can't say the same for his teaching ability. His lectures flew way above the heads of the majority of the class, and his textbook might as well be written in a foreign language. Homework and challenge sets will take entire days to complete. Gladly he is very generous with partial credit on exams. | Incredible professor, inspired me incredibly. Very challenging course for someone who had taken both Multi and Linear previously, but highly recommended - synthesizes the two topics fantastically. Grade is determined based on ""knowledge of material"" - he is very flexible when it comes to how you demonstrate it. | A challenging honors Linear Algebra / Calc III / Proofs class. Enormous time investment, would only recommend for people interested in Math as a major. Teaches from his own unpublished, typo-heavy book. | His lectures are very fast and very dense. He oftentimes talks to himself and makes a minimal attempt to answer students questions. Office hours aren't any more helpful. He teaches from a book he wrote himself. HW takes hours, the workshops likewise, and have fun on the exams! (because they're awful) | He is a genius but he is often in his own world. Teaches on a very high level but tends to cause students to get lost without explanation. Homework is difficult and time consuming. Workshops are also. He gives difficult but fair exams and then curves very generously. Gives an A for >80%. Don't buy the textbook if you take him - he does't use it! | Teaches out of his own lecture notes, which unfortunately were never completed during the semester. Demanding but fun class, very clear and friendly lecturer. Gives regular feedback on progress and very willing to talk outside of class. Absolutely worth taking for differential equations, even (especially) for engineers. | So this is a hard class, no joke. It's intended for potential math majors. If you're not interested in math as a subject, take regular calc 3. If you are interested in math, the class is a great introduction to higher level math and Professor Carlen works really hard to make sure everyone learns the material. Also, there is a very generous curve! | Although it is Honors Calc 3, it was still way harder than it should have been. His lectures were largely proofs without explanations of the implications, and his text was no different. Homework was very difficult and the exams had problems where the algebra would take longer than the calculus. I wouldn't take another class with him, if possible."
"Zhang, Wujun","The material for the class itself was pretty interesting, but you could tell that the assignments were copied from his data mining grad course. Assignments were few and extremely easy (the average for everything is consistently above 90). Easy A class -- I didn't really learn much because there was no incentive to. | Excellent lectures. Math heavy class with only a couple of small pseudocodes required. 4 HWs, 1st is hardest. Midterm and final are quite difficult easy grading. HWs have extra credit so easy to get As. He likes when we ask questions in class, always solves doubts with a lot of detail. | The best professor I've ever had at Rutgers. The class material was pretty hard, but the class was made to be very easy as long as you did your work. We got a bunch of extra credit which I didn't expect at all and the grading was extremely lenient. Was stressing at first hoping to pass and ended up with an A | He's what I would call an above average professor. His class is shamefully easy, he has insane extra credit problems (maximum +7% to final average), and final was take-home. He's also a very caring and humble guy. However, I wish he taught more content, like backtracking algorithms. I feel like I didn't learn too much from this course... | This professor is outstanding. He excels at explaining complex algorithms clearly, making even the most difficult concepts accessible. He encourages questions and thoroughly addresses all uncertainties. His lectures are well-organized and his grading is extremely fair. Take his class if you can - you'll learn a lot and be graded appropriately! | The best professor in CS dept for 344 | the goat | Great professor. The class project was very helpful for my job seeking. | Great professor; very lenient grader | He's good at teaching, makes complex topics clear. But some of his grading policies are a little questionable at best. His accent makes it hard to understand him sometimes and when talking to him outside of class (during office hours), he is very visibly awkward and uncomfortable which only makes you uncomfortable. He's still a solid professor. | He is probably the best professor since I joined Rutgers. Very much enjoyed his class. His teaching style is patient and clear. Would stop and patiently answer the questions from students. He also helped to connect the algorithms in this course with other subjects such as OS, AI and Networks, which helped me to connect the dots. Highly recommend! | Knowledgable professor and nicely organized class. Highly recommend! | Teaching was clear and well structured, learned a lot of useful knowledge and skills for designing algorithms from his class (already helped me in my job interviews). Overall a great class and great professor. His class is highly recommended. | Amazing professor! He is very knowledgable and his lecture is very insightful. His lecture is neat and clean and very well structured, making everything easier to understand for me. He also introduced several advanced topics which increased my interest in the area. Strongly recommend to take his class! | Professor Zhang is amazing ! Took him for CS344 and the class was super smooth. Even though it was online due to the pandemic, the class was well organized and straight forward. I love the way he teaches, goes over every small detail and never assumes that you know anything in prior, which is incredibly nice. He really cares about his students. | Zhang is probably the best professor I have had since attending Rutgers. He taught in a very clear and concise way, and planned his lectures very very nicely. The material was tough, but he was a fantastic professor. | I took algorithms this semester (remotely) with Zhang, and the course has been pretty easy. He uploads lectures every week, and while he isn't super engaging you can understand the concepts pretty well. The homework assignments are also easy, since you have plenty of time. There is no ProctorTrack on the midterm and final, and he gives you 24 hours | 344 Algorithms is a difficult class overall, mostly due to the nature of the subject (lots of theories!) But I find the prof's lecture to be clear and patient, making the subject a lot more fun. His materials are clear and neatly organized, making online learning easier to follow. yet you have to be self-motivated and keep up with the weekly pace. | Lectures are very long and boring hard to pay attention | Explains step by step. Very clear in his thoughts, lenient and caring. Always available for doubts. | Prof. Zhang is genuinely always available for students who want to learn. He also explains material step by step and difficult subject is easier to understand. He also supports student to come up with new idea or do great research. He genuinely praised student who come up with great idea. I recommended him for rutgers student to take his course. | Great professor, knows his material well. He gives valuable feedback and he is very accessible outside of class. This was the first time he taught a course at Rutgers and won best professor award for it too."
"Li, Yanyan","Forum is pretty difficult (and has a lot of writing) but Liz is very forgiving in terms of deadlines and grading. Explains everything clearly, keeps lectures interesting, and is always willing to talk. | CCC is a pass-fail class already, so it will be easy regardless of the professor; she's very lenient about showing up late (attendance matters though), grades easily, and overall, not bad. | get ready to read. 2-3 weekly discussion questions and at least 2 responses, 2 quizzes, midterm and final are really hard. she makes you study over 10 pages of work and only puts 25 questions on the tests. if you don't read, you will fail. you must participate. her lectures are entertaining but the class is a lot of work... | I have taken Amaya-Fernandez this fall semester 2016 Global health/Public Health @ William Paterson University. Her class is fairly easy somewhat. She is a nice Professor. She gives homework every week but its not challenging at all. Answer 1 of 2-3 questions and respond to 2 classmates. 2 quizzes(easy), Midterm and finals is kinda hard. | Disorganized. Sometimes takes a week to reply to an email. However, she was willing to work with students. Lectures presented really well. | Fairly easy class. A bit unorganized but a good professor. I got an easy A for a 400 level class. If you can easily talk about race, class, gender, and other social issues then this is the class for you. I do usually prefer online classes though, so take that into account. Would take again. | She very disorganized... Would forget to post grades and assignments but overall she was easy.... Midterm and final exam was online both open ended and multiple choice which was pretty easy... She also brought breakfast for the class sometimes which was so nice especially since it's an 3hr class.... I would recommend her | Sorta disorganized but always willing to help. Material is presented in a way you can relate and easily remember. excellent grade. Really easy A | Great Professor! Would definitely recommend a class with her. She is awesome! | Great professor makes everything very standard by breaking it down into straight forward words. There is no text book so you can definitely save some money. Wasn't interested at first but I truly enjoyed this class. Definitely take this for an easy A and an enjoyable experience | great professor. really knows her stuff. she gives you another perspective to view things. as long as you at least skim the book. thoroughly do the assignments the class is an easy A | Very unorganized. Claims that each class is a 'review' in itself. Which I guess is BS for 'i'm too lazy to teach'. She means well and her guest speakers are probably the best part of the class. Exams are all from the book and classes are a waste of time. It's not hard to do well in the class, just annoying | she's great. really encourages to students to voice their opinion. there are lots of little assignments to do and you make think its a lot but its really not. I did everything and got an A easily | She is VERY unorganized. Yes,she is a nice person,but she really doesn't know how to lecture. She is not good at responding to students through email. The exams are not representative of the lecture, so you need to read the book. Also, there is no real direction and most students didn't know what was going on or what was expected of us. | Really unorganized teacher. Does not know what to focus her lectures on. classes are an absolute waste of time. She usually has no affirmative/coherent point to what she says. assignments were really useful and made sense, good learning tools. | Take that class if u want an A badly! | This is a great class. The class is intresting and there is never a dull moment. She is a wonderful person that makes you evaulate ya life and others. There many little assigments but they are not hard because everything you learn in class basically helps you. I recommend this class to anyone. I got an A and I'm very happt to have taken this class. | She is a real nice grader and the assignments in class are very interesting | she is sweet and a reallly easy grader. there are alot of little assignments but the class is more discussion-oriented. definitely take if you want an easy A! | nice lady. class is more work than it's worth"
"Fuzeto Gameiro, Marcio","He is very good at explanations and understanding questions asked by students. Moreover, he is very good at allows for interactive lectures. Only downside is that he is not too animated during lectures, and he would be incredible if he had a more commanding presence in the class. | Professor Gameiro is a very nice guy who cares about the academic success of his students. His lectures are a nice balance between one way lecture and interactivity as he asks lots of clarifying questions. Explained challenging concepts in a way that was understandable for the class. | Nice guy, but a bad professor. During lectures he just read from his slides (that he copied straight from the textbook). Also he was absent at least 5 times (he did have a sub, though). However, he was good at answering emails. Exams weren't terribly difficult as long as you understood the review and homework problems. | In short, Marcio has no idea what he was doing. He taught the class through a powerpoint and basically read the textbook to us. Ultimately so many people did poorly that he made the final worth 80% and homework 20%. Class was extremely dry (partly because the material itself is dry) and his grading criteria was extremely unclear. Avoid. | A very good professor when he's here as he was out for conferences a number of weeks. If you need to take Differential Equations for Engineers take his class. Just make sure you have a good TA. | One of the worst professors I have yet had, which is saying a lot. Has been absent for half the semester so far. If you don't want to teach then don't hire a substitute for half the semester, just get us a real professor. A pretty poor professor when he does attend, though, so it's not missing much.."
"Xu, Guangbo","By far the best Professor I have had at Rutgers. Although CS 323 is a difficult class, Professor Xue makes sure you understand the concept and will help to whatever extent necessary to ensure you understand the concept. Truly cares about his students. I can go on and on about this guy but dont have sufficient number of characters left ."
"Sangam, Karuna","People in class complained, but I thought she was great. You'll be fine if you pay attention in class, take notes, and do the (optional) homework. She distributes review packets for each quiz and test you have, they're optional, but help prepare you. Take it from me, someone who only used the review packets to study and got an A. No final exam. | I took a hybrid course and she didnt lecture, expected students to pretty much teach themselves, and complained about low grades. | Doesn't explain problems correctly, confuses herself often, and is very hard to understand her concepts and her way of talking english. She doesn't listen to students needs like help with test/projects. Wouldn't recommend | I would not recommend Professor Taneja. Her lectures were long and often confusing. She was not able to convey the concepts properly, and I did not receive appropriate feedback when I asked for it. Homework does not have any weighting, and there are weekly quizzes to be completed over the weekend. 3 Tests during the semester. | Inaccessible outside of class. Does not care about the success of her students. I had a concern that I went to her with and emailed her 4 times in the span of 3 weeks and received no response (for context, the course was virtual). It wasn't until I copied her higher-up on the email that she responded. Never take a course with her. | I gotta say that, overall she is good grader but to get good score you gotta work hard and that really sucks, if you love hard work then have this class you will be good for sure | I loved Prof Taneja! Print out the Sections before class so you just have to fill things in, you won't have time to copy down everything. If you don't understanding something, don't wait just ask!!! Also do the hw to practice, it'll help you so you can complete quizzes. Overall, she's so helpful and nice | Not good | This was a really challenging course for my whole entire class, she is a very nice lady who tells it how it is. She wants her students to be successful but you will need to put in WORK to earn a passing grade. If you show that you care and are constantly trying to improve she will help you. Maybe this course with her is really hard, compared to oth | If you dont devote you entire life to this course you wont pass. | I'm almost done with Prof. Taneja's Calculus 2 Course and here's my thing about her. She give's out lots of hints for the quizzes and tests through the homework. I am basically on my knees to ask her for extra credit even though she is a tough grader. I need to transfer this back to my college. I basically had to give up lots of sleep and time | The professor is a really good professor. She was helpful if you needed extra help and it was a class where it is not that stressful. As long as you do the homework and quizzes, it can help you prepare for the exams very well. | Prof. Taneja is awesome! She always makes time for students if they need extra help so that everyone has the opportunity to master the material. | GREAT PROFESSOR...!!!! | she really cares about her students take her you wont regret it | She taught me so well she understands that not everyone comes with the same background in math and if you go to her office hours shell help you understand the concept even more. I learned from her more than out of the other professors I learned from here at mccc. | I never rate any professor, but mark my words I will I could take her in every class. participation and attendance matter. you have to show up in her class. she gives extra credit and also answer your all questions. definitely take her again. | I would definitely take her in allthe classes | She is one of the best professor I ever had. The professor is very caring and addresses every student. She will time tyo have answer your questions and also she gives review sheet for test and was very useful. But you have to come class everyday and she also gives extra credits. she cares about students who makes effort in studies. | Never take this Professor. She is the worst. Laughs if you find the class stressful. Does not know how to teach whatsoever. Dont know who gave her a degree. If you ask her for help she questions you and looks at you as if your incompetent. Tests are extremely hard and nothing like the reviews. Its like she enjoys seeing you fail. | If your care about math or your grade avoid her at all cost. Not sure why she has a 2.5. Its should be 0. She dosent teach. She speaks the topics at you and if the topic is not of her desired difficulty she will make It harder. She make tons of mistakes and gives no partial credit for anything.. very unepthetic and unprofessional. | Terrible. I could barely understand anything she was saying half of the time. She has a terrible way of trying to explain the steps of the problems in word form. She also used MyMathLab which did not match up with what she was teaching in class, the program used different wording which could easily trick someone. I do not suggest this professor. | Don't take ANY class taught by this professor | She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. When she grades the tests, she doesn't look at the way we approached the problem, but if the answer is wrong she gives you a zero even if the steps are right. And also, she doesn't want to help the students too, for example, if we ask her too many doubts, she asks us to figure it out ourselves. | If you care about your sanity and your GPA, don't even consider taking this professor. I've never seen a more biased and inconsiderate teacher throughout my educational career. She shows no consideration for a students circumstances.. Also what she teaches in class is different from the homework.. and that is also different from the tests she gives | I hate her grading policy she is horrible teacher, she gives extra credit then she gave hard test so no extra credit. she gave me D even I show up every lecture, Dont take her | Professor is very dedicated and caring. She addresses every student and will have time to answer your questions. Remind is used for announcements and review and guidelines are given for tests. Lectures are important and interesting with online poll questions. | Do not take her even if shes the last professor for calc. She makes many mistakes and abuses my math lab. Doesnt follow the textbook. examples on test are NOTHING like the reviews or what she taught us. All the other reviews are either created by her or faculty. stay away if you care about your grade. i wish i did. | Prof. Taneja is an absolutely fabulous professor. She will explain everything carefully and concisely, she also takes time to address any questions students happen to have. She also will allow her to contact her for questions on the material through remind. Made learning pre calc as easy as it can be. | she is awesome. I would definitely prefer her for all the classes. She takes care of every single student in class and she is just awesome. Just do whatever is taught in class and you will be getting an easy A grade. Love her :) | Prof. Teneja is amazing! She makes sure the class understands what she is teaching and she is very willing to help you one-on-one! Her tests and quizzes are really short too which is a plus. I would take her again in a heartbeat if she taught MAT129B. She gave me back confidence I lost when I took pre-calc in high school due to a horrible teacher."
