"Govindarajoo, Geeta","There's no point of going to her lectures when all of the resources are available on canvas... On top of that, she keeps telling you to look it up on textbook instead of explaining things during lecture. This class is horribly structured, but the lab itself is pretty cool! Lot of busy work for 2 credit course tho... | This class is as busywork-heavy and inefficient as possible. 1 hr lecture, 1 hr playposit, 1+ hours of her OTHER videos you must watch + take notes for the 3rd time.. quiz, pre-lab, post lab, hw assignment, assigned reading. Professor, please learn to condense your materials. Everyone would be happier with more straight forward learning | This is a really easy and fun class. You'll learn about the chemicals and bonds within different art supplies and pigments. She also has a lot of demonstrations done by the department that are usually quite interesting. All the exams are online and the quizzes/class questions are very easy. Would recommend if you're looking for an easy elective. | Overall easy class! She's very passionate about chemistry and some lectures were interesting. Not much work to do besides online homework and one paper. Online, open-note exams and as someone who is bad at science subjects, this was a very chill and easy A class. Strongly recommend if you are looking for an easy class. | Govindarajoo's emails were so long and too much information just for a lab class. She put a lot of emphasis on her class as if students didn't have other courses to attend to. She's also very straight arrow and by the book which can be irritating. Overall not the worst experience just pick a good lab group and watch the lab videos. | LOT of work for 2 credits. 4 assignments, quiz, lab session every week. Get a good TA for lab and you'll be fine. Didn't go to her lecture once, just reviewed on my own and was fine. Quizzes/Final pretty difficult, and a lot for the amount of time you have to do them. Have to work hard even for a B, need to be on top of the material to keep up. | Worst professor at Rutgers. | Prof G.'s class is a real grind - tons of busy work and confusing lectures. But unstuckstudy ai was a lifesaver for efficient study prep. The textbook is essential, but don't expect much hand-holding. Stay focused and you might just survive! | She's nice enough but there's a LOT of work that is assigned in this class. The experiments are actually cool, my main issue is just the ridiculous amounts of work. Prelab, postlab, playposit, textbook homework, quiz, the experiment, plus an attendance grade... It's too much. Not necessarily hard, just a lot, and very annoying/time consuming | I literally took this lady because there is no one else, get ready to cry. its my last semester at RU, I hope she doesn't ruin it 4 me | Get ready to cry | Way to much work, for way too little credit, for way too rude of a professor. My TA was great, but I couldn't stand geeta for the life of me. | TERRIBLE RUDE MEAN PROFESSOR Terribly structured course. professor IGNORES student emails asking for additional help or course feedback. MANY other professors of the chemistry department have expressed deep concerns and hatred for this course and its structure. You are told to LOOK UP information on your own during lecture. WHAT AM I PAYING FOR?!?! | Chemistry of art was interesting and manageable. Just pay attention to lecture slides - she lets you use them during quizzes but still don't go into the test blind. HW load isn't too bad. We got to see some fun experiments in class. Prof was super sweet and knowledgeable and I enjoyed her lectures. | Her lectures are solely based on her slides. You dont really need to attend class after she finishes her attendance checks at the beginning of the year. At that point you can just watch the lecture video shes posts afterward. My exams were all online. Most of the stuff on the exams are from the lectures kinda exactly. | easy class for non-stem majors. the information is complicated but the tests are all open-note. this could potentially be an extremely interesting and interactive class but most of the time it's just a boring, put-you-to-sleep lecture. prof is sweet and passionate. | I gained nothing from this class. It is manageable but very boring & difficult at times. However, exams are open notes. Lots of busy work, but only because Prof wants to boost ur grade. Prof is nice & passionate about the subject, but the class isn't worth taking--If ur a non-stem major, there r easier natural science classes w/less work. | Downright awful experience in this class. I only needed to take 6 credits and this 2 credit class had me working harder than my friends with 15 credits. Asks you to look at the textbook for every concept she doesn't want to explain. Literally none of those concepts showed up on the quizzes. Get ready to get obliterated for a chance at a B | I took this course thinking of learning more about art pieces but it's only about chemistry. You would have to re-learn all chemistry knowledge from high school and know how to solve questions. It is NOT an easy A or interesting course. The professor never allows you to submit an assignment late even if you email her, and is a strict grader. | The worst class I've ever taken. The work load is ridiculous for a 2 credit course. Has multiple videos to watch per week along with mandatory lectures, quizzes, assignments, post labs, and pre labs. She doesn't even cover everything in her videos and expects you to read the textbook for the info. I hope this course load is reevaluated. | Assigns so many unnecessary assignments. Every week 4 assignments and a quiz, on top of notes, lecture and a lab period. Constantly tells students to refer to the textbook in lecture rather than actually giving us the lecture. Was way too hard of a class for 2 credits | You'd think there's no possible way to make this class worse but don't worry, Geeta comes in with 10 new assignments to make your life that much harder. Just because we're home does not mean we're not busy with our classes - stop making this class so unbearably monotonous | Prof G. just reads slides w/ little additional insight. Quizzes cover irrelevant details that oftentimes aren't even in her lectures. Constantly says ""read the textbook"" whenever she doesn't feel like discussing a concept. Over 50 assignments (2 credits), most of which take hours to complete. Grade composition doesn't prioritize actual lab work. | There was no need to have quizzes, outlines, PlayPosits, interactive assignments, and prelabs/postlabs due every week. The material on the quizzes was not really related to what was taught in class which made them difficult. She also told us to look a bunch of things up in the lecture outline instead of actually telling us the answers. | Professor absolutely sucks. Woman does nothing but make sure your life is as difficult as possible. 5 assignments due every week, a lab, and quizzes that have 0 relevancy to whatever we completed. she has no sympathy to what students are dealing with and forced me to cram everything i missed when i had to take a break from school in one week. 0/10 | NON STEM MAJORS. listen. if youre required to take a science class, take this one. the class mostly focuses on different artistic techniques and the science behind them. but the chemistry youre required to know is equivalent to high school chem. all tests and quizzes are completely open note too. definitely worth it if you need a science credit. | At first, I was scared of taking this class bc of her reviews, but ChemofArt is actually one of the easiest classes I took. Exams are open notes; outline of her lectures is given (kinda like fill-in blanks); lectures are recorded as well so you don't really have to go but I did it to socialize haha; occasional pop quizzes but easy; manageable hw | It's baffling to me how Rutgers insists on the faculty in its chemistry department continuing to hold their positions. Worst class I've taken bar none; offers little learning value, will drain any prior interest, and is a useless timesink. It almost seems like it's intentionally disorganized to create ""difficulty"". Rutgers loves its rigor. | I hate this class so much. In the lecture the prof tells you to look stuff up instead of just teaching us the information. I am so beyond done with everyone in the chemistry department at Rutgers. This class is so infuriating and difficult BECAUSE SHE DOESNT TEACH US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW. | Listen this class is so bad and there's no way of changing that. This professor is very hard and is terrible with communication. She doesn't care about the students at all only her own life. There is so much work and so many quizzes/assignments that are all insanely difficult. This course is not worth 2 credits. WORST CLASS IVE EVER TAKEN | her class is just incredibly insane with so much heavy schoolwork. Tons of information have to be rote memorized but barely explain the mechanisms behind it. When you communicate nicely with her about these problems, she never thinks about her problem yet come up with a bunch of course policies and personal maneuvers to hide those problems away. | Advice: Take notes on EVERY single lecture including the textbook for the corresponding lab that week. Study, study, study. Do not wing the quizzes, they are HARD & Only doable if you study well. Do as best you can on the postlabs, prelabs, PQ & HW, they will boost ur grade. Don't rely on the notes for quizzes, its way to fast paced, know the info | All i have to say is: good luck. | I dont even know how she still has a job at rutgers, worst class i've ever taken. You are expected to do a prelab, postlab, playposit, homework assignment, lecture quiz and lab quiz ALL in ONE WEEK & you do this for 12 weeks straight lol. Can't forget about the pointless projects that we were forced to do as well. You need to dedicate a lot to this | This class was the worst. It is not that the class was hard, but there was too much busy work for 2 credits. This is made worse by her forcing you to hunt down information in the textbook as opposed to teaching it. Quizzes were very poorly written. The experience will be even worse if your TA is a harsh grader. | Biggest waste of time. Exams/weekly quizzes make up like 50% of your grade so you actually have to try. Expect your pre/postlabs to take about 2 weeks to get graded. Overall worst class I've taken at Rutgers, way too much for 2 credits. | This professor does not care about her students at all. She never emails back and shes rude in general. Also the work that is given is just unbelievable, you will not be able to catch a break. Shes really unfair | I usually don't have a problem with classes. I have no problem with Dr. Govindarajoo herself. But this was terrible. The material isn't difficult but I spent hours in this class hunting down information in the textbook. It is ridiculous and leaves no time for anything else. I strain myself to hell and back trying to match the deadlines. | I have never left a review on RMP before but I just had to now. Govindarajoos class is WAY too involved for a 2 credit lab. We have so many assignments due every week not to mention 3 WEEKLY QUIZZES. Plus a library project, final project, and final exam. She has to understand her class isnt the only class we are taking. Would give a 0 if I could. | such a huge workload for only 2 credits, requires hours upon hours of work a week | For a 2 credit class, there is WAY too much work. Between the post labs, pre-labs, weekly assignments, PQs, and the weekly quizzes, I have to prepare more for this class than all of my other classes combined. Dr. Govindarajoo is useless in all this since she makes you look everything up in the textbook instead of teaching. I DO NOT RECCOMEND. | Horrible professor. You might actually get worse at orgo from this class. You will definitely start to hate it. Everything is so much more confusing and complicated than necessary, wasting HOURS and HOURS. She ignores advice about the course, and refuses to replace incompetent TAs that can't even speak compressible english. | such a rude and egotistical lady. cant even ask any questions or for any help. | Its a lot of busy bee work, but I dont think it really helped me with learning organic chemistry lab principles. It takes much of time and energy to do the work but dont a proportional gain in experience and understanding | Orgo lab isn't too difficult, it's just a lot of busy work - the weekly prelabs, postlabs, and quizzes take some time to complete. Dr. G's quizzes can be tough, but if you take good lecture notes and glance at the textbook you should be fine. I took this course without taking orgo 2 and I got an A, so it's definitely doable. | The most disorganized Professor I have ever encountered in all 4 years of undergrad. Ridiculous amounts of work for 2 credits, and resources (with important info) are scattered everywhere. Cumulative, but you don't get work feedback until 2 weeks after. It's not the TA grading the reports late, it's Geeta intentionally releasing grades late... | I took her chemistry of art class as a business major who likes art and it's a really amazing class. You really need to pay attention to the lectures because she goes over a lot but it's really cool stuff. If you want to take this class for sas core, you should prob have a basic understanding of chem bc it can get hard. Difficult but cool! | She catches too much heat for late grades, which is not her fault (grading is all done by TAs). She's still pretty unorganized with her uploads online, finding the correct material is like a bad scavenger hunt. Lectures are super dry and always leaves out information for you to ""find in the textbook,"" but quiz/lab questions are verbatim from notes. | The class is online because of COVID. Very unstructured and you don't get back your grades until many weeks later. The quizzes and exams were open book, but that didn't help much. You just have to understand conceptually. Your grade depends on your TA pretty much | She is the most unstructured professor I have ever witnessed. Her notes are all over the place and I feel like she doesn't realize or at least care how much busy work she gives us. Its ridiculous"
"Jimenez, Leslie","Taught myself chem 127, it was horrible for my mental health. Only reads off of the slides without actually teaching. Please do not take this course with this professor, and if you have to prepare to teach yourself. Doesn't respond to email or answer questions for student benefit | Horrible teacher, lectures are completely useless. She gives a good study guide for tests though so as long as you follow those, read the textbook, and do the hw you should be fine. | ... | Her voice isnt terrible to follow, you can still learn the criteria. Her class was graded based on 2 exams and one 1 final exam and 4 PowerPoint presentations (easy grade). She doesnt reply to emails ever, and even if you go up to her in class she never has a solid answer to those emails. If you can avoid this professor I highly recommend it. | Barely Passed Orgo 1. Without Jimenez's help too. I can't imagine what it was like for others during this time. Most difficult class I have taken. Final was 50% of our grade. Prof Jimenez failed to respond to emails. She start regrading the first exams from September and October in December after the final & final grade was posted after New Years. | Everyone complains abt her voice, but it's not that bad. Plz remember tht one can have medical issues tht makes their voice a bit screechy. Hers is totally bearable in my opinion. Not the best at teaching, but she'll always answer ur questions & listen to ur opinion. Not good at responding to emails. Her exams are the easiest out of the 3 profs. | Her voice screeches and is unbearable. She reads off the slides as if we cannot read them ourselves. Has example problems to do in class, but doesn't explain/go over them. She's teaching as if we already know the subject as well as her. The textbook is the only thing that saved me."
"Boikess, Robert","Boikess was absent this semester. Study from the textbook and do the practice exams/quizzes - they are a very good indication of what will be on exams. Come to class with some idea of the lecture content. | JUST TAKE REGULAR ORGO with normal lectures not this ""active learning"". This is the worst class setup where you have to teach yourself everything; his online ""lectures"" are just him talking with no notes. I can't even understand how this is allowed. Teaching myself Organic Chemistry of all things. The worst class I have ever taken at Rutgers. | Review previous exams/quizzes and use notes/google to figure out how each question was answered. Practice any incorrect questions and keep studying them, eventually you'll find yourself skipping certain questions because they're too easy. Try timing yourself as well. Don't stress too much because chemistry takes a while to understand, it's normal. | Improving throughout the course (especially on the later exams / final) and participation (aka going to class and turning in your group work) can really boost your grade! Most people don't well so try to compare your exam grades to the class average too. His notes are hard to get through, so I would recommend using the textbook, especially for orgo | I wish I could give zero stars because he truly doesn't even deserve 1. Believe every terrible review on here. There are no lectures in person, only online prerecorded lectures from the pandemic w little to no visual & just him horribly verbalizing the topic. Dont even waste your time listening to them, just get a tutor and do practice problems. | attendance isn't mandatory but he takes it. and factors in how often you came to class when it's time for final grades i recommend teaching urself in this class, read the textbook and do the practice exams on canvas you'll b alright. final exam is what determines if u pass or fail go to review sessions w/ the TA plz. he sucks at explaining things!! | This professor has no purpose at all, you teach yourself everything. You ask him a question and he's confused himself and doesn't answer it. I asked him if we round to whole number or by tenth etc, and he said ""go up if its above 5"".... like what? Honestly he seems to old to be teaching the course, chem isn't easy and he makes it harder | To pass this class with a good grade, you have to review the practice problems he gives in class. He also uploads past exams, which were very helpful since some problems were similar or exact to the exams he gave. | DONT FALL BEHIND! Took this class 2x to pass. He curves you individually based on if you improve from exam 1-3 &on quizzes. I had a grade of 60 but he curved me to a B since my grades got better. Lectures are recorded & in class you do practice problems. If you dont put in the work & watch the lectures, you will NOT pass trust me! | I basically failed the first 2 exams, getting below average on both, 48 and 36 respectively, and the averages were 55 and 48 respectively. Got a 68 on the final tho after studying hella which was like a whole 20 points above the average. His recorded lectures kinda help but the past exams he uploads are what you NEED to review. PRACTICE PRACTICE!!! | IF YOU READ THE LECTURE NOTES AND PUT EFFORT INTO REACHING OUT FOR HELP AND STUDYING, YOU WILL DO FINE I think boikess gets a bad rep but i enjoyed his class alot although sometimes he is hard to understand and the lecture notes are long, he is always available to answer any questions email zoom in person. very smart- dont fall behind | This professor made me hate my life. He is one of the worst if not the worst professors I have ever had. HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO TEACH and the only reason I understand anything is because of the organic chemistry tutor. It is more of an asynchronous class but he forces you to show up in person otherwise you lose points bc no one would show up! | Chem of Life was difficult, but the curve at the end made it manageable to get a good passing grade. Tests are difficult, but he does provide old resources that help a lot. Be sure to read the textbook and do the problems to grasp the basic concept. The class is difficult, but the final exam mainly determines your final grade. | This course was in-person now and was difficult. Dr. Boikess is available for office hours, so go to those with questions. Look at past exams and classwork. Go to class if you want to do well. Exams are hard but he curves. Watch his lectures, read his lecture notes, and skim over or read the textbook for a better understanding. | Chem should not be asynchronous. His pre-recorded lectures/review sessions were a joke with zero visuals. I recommend just reading the textbook, taking notes on it, and doing the practice problems. STUDY THE OLD EXAMS POSTED TO CANVAS!!! Content itself wasn't terrible if you took a chem in high school, but definitely need to work for your grade. | Horrible. This class is the absolute worst. Professor does not care about his class and exams are extremely hard to pass. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROFESSOR! | Get ready to hate your life for a semester. Professor Boikess is lazy and can't even bother to write down his work. His prerecorded lectures are long with little to no visual examples. Exams are beyond difficult and hard to prepare for. No opportunity for extra credit so hopefully you are a good test taker. | Tough professor but very knowledgeable, makes you work for your grade but was always available to help if you needed to have something clarified. Gets a bad rap from many students, but I think theyre just whiners who didnt want to work. Great lecturer but he doesnt spoon feed you the information. | hes so rude, uncaring, and hardly teaches. his review sessions are unhelpful and doesnt show the work hes doing. the way he talks is so unengaging too. take regular orgo if you can do not take this class... | this class makes me want to cry. as others have said, his lecture notes are essay-like and he never provides step-by-step solutions for anything. final grades are based on exam avgs, but he won't count scores below a certain % when calculating them. he also purposely made our exams happen after the holidays. prob the hardest class i've taken. | Too many things to be said. This is supposed to be ELEMENTARY organic chemistry, but he teaches it like regular orgo chem, probably worse. The lecture notes are essay-like, with a lot of words and little visual explanation - much like his review sessions. You are only graded on exams and a few quizzes, and the exams are impossible to pass. | There are not a lot of good thing to say about his teaching. Mostly because there's little teaching on his end. If you're a visual leaner, you're going to have a rough time. Podcast-like lectures and his essay-style lecture notes. One upside is his over reliance on the textbook, so you'll be fine going off that and steering clear of his material. | I just took his class spring of 2021 and was doing exceptionally well until he decided that I cheated, even though I didn't and there was no proof of me cheating. On top of that, he does not communicate at all with his students and on top of that takes off a grade point if you ""bug him too much"" over email. His TA was extremely creepy. | Hes a nice guy, but lectures are all asynchronous so we cant ask questions until the review or if we email him. Even then, his explanations are very difficult to understand. Lectures are almost completely verbal with no explanation on visuals. Exams feel impossible to pass. | Personality wise, hes an okay guy. But as a professor he's terrible. I'm taking him for his ""sync"" class in spring 2021 and we ALL are struggling. I'm literally teaching myself everything because his lectures are not only boring, he doesn't show the work for problems. if we were in person he'd better but clearly online is way ahead of his time. | 209 was taught async this semester. He teaches through a few slides and talks most of the time (lecture is mostly verbal). I do not think he is a bad professor, he just has a different teaching style that does not work well when teaching orgo (but does explain the material). he is a genuine person, very sarcastic, monotoned so take breaks w lecture | He's a nice guy but it's impossible to learn, you are teaching yourself. Whatever you do dont do it, this class gave me so much anxiety and the lectures dont help they are very confusing. | Man needs to retire. Lectures are dry and put me to sleep. Hes just reading from his notes. Tests are impossible to study for. Its a 3 credit courses that required a ridiculous amount of work to barely pass. Class averages are 50s but he does some messed up bell curve that makes the lower students grades actually worse. | I took him for Chem of Life and he was horrible. Even before we switched to Online classes, his lectures were impossible to follow. His handwriting was awful and the way he explained was so dry. It was a lot easier to learn through the textbook. He was also just plain mean. The way he replied to emails/answered questions were degrading at best. | I heard so much stuff about this professor but unlike what was said, I think that he is a really sweet guy. He is veryyyy smart and gives practice quiz and exams which were really helpful on his actual quiz/exam. Chemistry is hard to teach and hard to understand so I do suggest reading the textbook if you have never taken chemistry before. | the system of three professors after each exam is terrible. | The overall average for the past semester was a 51, after getting rid of scores that fell below a certain value. He claims that the class average is a C+, but even doing 20 points above this average only got me a B+. Anywhere else, this average would have put you at an A. But not with boikess. Perhaps one of the most unfair professors at Rutgers | Super unfair guy and unfortunately the course coordinator. He abuses his power by using false statistics to showcase higher averages. His grades are based upon upward trend so someone with a lower grade than you can end with an A and you with a B+. Which is sheer stupidity considering someone can purposely try less on the first. | Organic chemistry is a very hard subject. But professor Boikess just makes it even harder at Rutgers. He doesn't use any slideshow or explain material clearly. The exams are ridiculously hard and the grading system is total nonsense. For me, he will always be remembered as one of the worst nightmare to pre med/dental students. | Hes pretty good at teaching if you pay attention in lectures. Listen closely to what he says and dont bother using the book to study orgo because he has his own Way of doing orgo that the book doesnt follow. I barely passed but my test average was around a 40 and I still passed so do the homework and go to class. | While professor Boikess was decent at introducing orgo to us, his lack of visual notes during lectures made it very difficult to understand what he was talking about, and his drawings were rough at best. As coordinator he routinely gave ""averages"" that weren't true averages, and continues to make the course more difficult than it needs to be. | Orgo307 with Professor Boikess was a challenge for any student's sanity. His portion of the course was arguably the easiest but somehow was made more difficult by him and consisted of him trying to use a Microsoft Surface he had no idea how to use. As course coordinator his false use of statistics and unfair exams/grading makes for a bad time. | Well known as a gatekeeper (and for a good reason). As painful as this course is, I highly recommend it to anybody who feels like they need to be challenged. You WILL have trouble and you WILL need help from outside sources, but that's simply the nature of Orgo. Take good notes, go to office hours, find your peers and hunker down. | There's a lot of things heard about Boikess. Honestly, if you do want an A, you need to work really really hard unless you were born a genius. His lectures are kind of boring, but his notes are very in depth. Grading wise-yes, exams are often graded harshly, at least in my experience. ACS saved my grade so def take it. | I found out after taking orgo 1 that the key to acing the exams is reading every single word in his lecture notes. Any and every piece of info he puts in the notes is not only fair game on an exam, but it is to further your understanding and appreciation for orgo. His notes are by far the best out of the 3 profs in terms of preparation for exams. | Boikess is the best orgo professor. He uses real world examples to help you understand the material and constantly reassures that ""you don't need to know orgo to be able to do ___"". His notes are just an outline of what he is going to say in class so print them out and annotate them. If you skip class to read them later, it will be very confusing | He has the hard job of introducing organic to people who have never even thought this type of way before and so I give him props for that. You cannot go into lecture knowing nothing and expect it to make sense, go to lecture prepared and you will understand him. Hes a rather inspiring guy and gives a break during lecture which is appreciated. | The textbook should be your primary resource for this class. Go to office hours every week, and go to each test review session before each Exam. Taking every practice exam possible is recommended, as well as doing each set of practice problems for each chapter. The lectures themselves are only useful if you have read BEFORE class. | I guess I'll say something good and bad. I'll start with the bad: he really doesn't put any effort into his lectures. I understand there is limited time, but at least Jimenez and Roth use powerpoint slides and explain everything in a methodical flow. Anyways the good is, he only teaches a 1/3 of the class, and he tries to give you the best grade | Honestly, I took orgo thinking that I am gonna have the worst semester ever and tbh it wasn't even that bad. Yeah the class is hard but it is definitely doable if you put the right amount of effort into it. This class is no joke. Don't rely on lectures because they won't help. Just make sure you know what you are going to be tested on. | Boikess is an amazing teacher. Chemistry is still hard though., so be prepared to put in a lot of work. If you fail orgo it's your fault for not taking advantage of the office hours, there's so many office hours. | Spends half the lecture talking his achievements. Spends the other half rushing through material. Not sure what he is trying to achieve in this class. | Not enough practice or preparation in lectures. Would not take again. | Its a 2-in-1 class. You get what you put into this class. Nothing more. | Dr. Boikess and the whole Organic department are inept. No concept of how to teach. The material is hard in nature because you can't find patterns from problems and memorize them. There are so many ways of presenting a problem that you need to understand the principles and apply them. Because of the nature of the course, we need educators."
"Rabeony, Manese","Best. Professor. Ever. (For chem at least). I took gen chem before but dropped it due to getting a low midterm 1 grade. However, with Rabeony he makes everything very simple and you will do very well on exams especially if you use the practice exams provided. Pls if you need a good chem professor get Rabeony. | If you go to every lecture and take good notes, you will pass. Great and funny professor, his exams are very similar to the practice tests, to the point where some questions are copy pasted. Definitely look over the practice test walkthroughs and you will get an A. | Great professor, interesting lecture. I will definitely take his class again. | Good luck lol. Last spring C cutoff was a 50. If your grade on the ACS final was higher than your lowest grade from exam 1-3 it would replace it. Hes a great prof I enjoyed his teaching but the class itself is difficult. | Rabeony's class is tough, but worth the effort. Attend lectures, use unstuckstudy for extra practice, and you'll do well. The ACS final is a challenge, but he wants us to succeed. | You want to make sure you really try to go into lecture knowing the topic, its a lot of work but worth it. He is good off season and makes the exams easier then which is nice, he really cares that we all pass so just put in the effort. Class is very math heavy so really try to work on the math skills. | HE IS THE BEST | Chem is really boring but Mr. Rabeony is a nice and funny prof and you can tell how much he loves chem. Chem grading is really weird tho. Go to his office hours it will help more then going to the TAs. | could've gotten a B if the final exam wasn't ACS and 3 hours instead of 2, homeworks were avg weren't easy nor difficult, chem department is messed up overall | THE BEST | Great professor, I would recommend taking this class if you are thinking of taking Chem 1. This class made it easier to understand the material that is going to be covered in Chem 1. The professor is really passionate and enthusiastic about what he does as a lecturer. Textbook is provided but didn't use it much. | . | His phenomenal science experience are indescribable. ""Don't Study, Learn the Concepts!!"" | Professor Rabeony is a nice man, who truly wants all his students to pass. But be warned, chemistry at Rutgers is very hard! Quizzes are online and harder than exams. Exams are all multiple-choice. You will not succeed in this class by simply memorizing info, you must teach yourself the material. Don't take chem at Rutgers if you can help it. | I took Rabeony for Chem 1/2 and let me just say, THE BEST CHEM PROFESSOR AT RUTGERS. He writes his own exams so they are 100% better than the horrific ones that Kimmel makes. He is a very good and clear professor and explains everything you need to know for exams, just do his practice, and you will pass! | Very caring and funny professor. I liked the fact that he wrote down notes while lecturing rather than zooming through slides like most professors. I never felt like I was behind while taking his class. He takes his time to make sure all students understand the topics. Exams are fair, but make sure you understand each topic and homework question. | Professor Rabeony is the best Gen Chem professor at Rutgers and cares for his students. One thing that separates Rabeony from the rest is that he writes the notes as he goes during lecture rather than just showing PowerPoints. His exams are all multiple choice and are not too difficult as long as you do the practice problems for each chapter | he is passionate about chem and his lectures help but you HAVE to do a lot of work outside of lecture in order to do well. i haven't had any other chem prof at RU but from what i've heard, rabeony is probably one of the better options. the online quizzes on elearning are harder than the exams, exams are multiple choice, DO THE REVIEW PROBLEMS | Prof Rabeony is dedicated to helping students learn. Saying that, the reviews here misled me as his teaching style is kind of annoying. Asking questions always make me feel dumb. Half the answers to the practice worksheets r wrong and he doesn't release the solutions until the chapter is over making it hard to know if what your doing is correct. | WELCOME TO LEARNING! Chem is definitely not my subject but prof Rabeony made the class much more enjoyable. He is very high energy (even at 8:30 in the morning) and is very adamant about taking notes. Lecture was very important to understand materials on quizzes although homework was frustrated as it often had precarious grading and mistakes in it. | I was pretty nervous for this class, but this Professor was amazing. The examples he gives in class can help clarify topics a lot and help with exam questions. In my opinion though, the quizzes were much harder than the exams. The quizzes sometimes have nothing to do with what we learned in class and were a waste of time. | The professor was good at lecturing and making the material understandable for us students. He was funny and was always encouraging us to work hard, but also not to stress about grades as they weren't everything. The chem department at rutgers is suspicious, so we still dealt with grading problems, even up to the final exam. | Professor Rabeony is the absolute BEST professor in the chem department. He is truly a delight and really wants all students to LEARN the material to obtain the good grades. I'd recommend him 10000000 times! | I took chem off season so the lectures were pretty late but he made them fun and interesting. The beginning of the semester was pretty good but towards the end he definitely didn't have enough time to go over the last 2 chapters. I would def like to have another course with this professor. | I took chem 133 with Dr. Rabeony after dropping chem 161 last semester. He was truly amazing!!!!! He is great for visual learners as he teaches with a lot of flow charts and examples. He has a very unique teaching style and is hilarious. I decided to take chem 161 with him this semester and am on track to get an A. TAKE HIM!!! | Dr. Rabeony is an amazing professor and I was so glad to have him for 134 and now 161, hopefully 162 if Im lucky. He does have an accent but believe me, it is not difficult to understand him. For 161, there are only quizzes that we are graded by but he really knows what he teaches. His lectures are easy to follow through and hes caring/funny! | Rabeony is a character. He was SUPER easy for Prep for Gen Chem & even Chem 161, but as the content gets harder, his not-so-great explanations will leave you a bit confused. I found myself going to the textbook/YouTube for clarification on some more complex topics, but overall he's a decent professor for the upper level gen chem courses. | Rabeony is a legend. He's got a pretty hard accent, but I understood him better than most other profs w/accents. Super nice guy, but kind of weird. I wouldn't exactly say I LEARNED the content in prep for gen chem w/him, but I passed with an A so I learned a decent bit. Kind a weird explainer, mainly; ""The electrons kiss"" covalent bonds typa guy | I had professor Rabeony in the summer of 2021, pass chem 1 during 2018 and manage to do well in his class because he explained well and always show us the steps that use most in the exams. Overall, he is the best chem professor I have ever taken; I m not good at chem but still manage to end up with B. | I truly do believe some subjects can only be interesting if taught by the right professor and Professor Rabeony is just that professor! He makes it a point that you learn the material, not study it and he will make sure you understand as long as you make it a point to ask. | He knows his stuff but doesnt deliver the message well. As a teacher I wasnt a fan. I felt dumb every time I asked a question, the lectures were all over the place. I relied on YouTube videos and the textbook for the most part. | I had Dr. Rabeony for chem 161 and was excited to have him again for chem 162 and he did not disappoint!!!! the material was a little harder at times but he makes it very clear and teaches in ways in which its easy to understand the concepts. he worries more about you actually learning the material than chasing grades and is always encouraging!!! | Professor Rabeony is the best!!!!!! He goes at a good pace in class but will answer every question. He always stops to make sure the class is following and made the content very clear and easy to learn. The exams were pretty good if you used the resources he gives to study and he made chem easy and fun to learn!!!! Take him if you have the chance!! | Dr. Rabeony is for sure one of the best professors in the Chemistry Department. If you are planning on taking chem 161, try to get in his section! Even though it was difficult for him in an online setting, things were still able to get done by the end of class. I'll be taking chem 162 in the summer and I'm glad I managed to get in his section! | The best in the chem department hands down. Online learning was a bit frustrating with him, but overall was fair in grading this semester & simplified a lot of the concepts. He's different than other chem professors & I really appreciate him & his teaching style. | the ONLY professor to take for Rutgers Chem. U srsly wont regret taking him. do everything u can to get into his classes. | Funniest professor I have had at Rutgers. He has a very specific way of teaching, so you'll either hate it or love it. His lectures are a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention you'll be fine. Rutgers Chem dept. has few gems, but Rabeony has definitely been my best chem professor. He's a great person and wants all his students to do well. | Literally the greatest teacher ever. Explains chemistry so well and an amazing person | Best professor I've had at Rutgers! If you come to class with a frown, you leave with a smile thinking about units and electrons. | WELCOME TO LEARNING! Prof Rabeony actually writes his own lecture notes that are really helpful compared to the PowerPoints the other chem professors have. If you have to take Chem at Rutgers, make sure it's with him. Do the review sheets for each chapter and you'll be set. | WELCOME TO LEARNING! It is evident that Dr. Rabeony wants each and every one of his students to succeed. He always says that people forget the grades they get and ""only knowledge remains"". He wants you to LEARN the material and not chase grades. One of the BEST professors in the Chemistry department. You will be blessed to have him as a professor! | GUYS, WELCOME TO LEARNING | probably the only good one in the chem department. very rare to find people that don't like him because he knows what he's talking about, he literally writes out every problem and just remember to always listen to the units | A blessing to the Chem Department and probably the only chemistry professor that is interested in teaching students. He's so hilarious and makes sure you know the material. He explains it in a more simple way and the lectures are nowhere dry. He's the best, take him or fail Chem 1. | So this guy's entertaining in class. Real genuine. But he always seemed sporadic. Made mistakes from time to time, even on the review packets. I've been told he was snarky in office hrs. I never got why Fadeeva only gave 3 poll questions when others did 4? This class is a breeze if you took AP Chem, but be prepared to practice if you feel behind. | After failing chemistry 1, I retook the class with Professor Rabeony. Although he gets side tracked easily, his lectures are amazing!!! Copy down his notes, do the practice problems (aka old exams), and do the practice test, and you'll get a good grade! He also writes the exams so just study what he goes over in class. | Knows his stuff but goes off topic easily, lecuture was a good review because he went over exactly what you need to know for exams, just v frantic and tells random stories in class, v funny tho. He got so behind that final didn't have the last chap on it. But he's best of the worst because chem dept sucks here. Easy A (off-szn) if you took AP Chem. | Honestly going into this I thought based on the reviews he would be good however I really did not like him. his lectures are all over the place, mostly random examples and he never gets through what he plans. TI office hours saved my grade the homework lecture attendance and quizzes are a WASTE of time but easy points. GO TO OFFICE HOURS W TAS | I struggled with chem in high school so I was nervous to take it in college but Rabeony was such a great teacher and simplified the concepts so they were easier to understand. Hes also really wants you to do well and answers questions and such. We didnt use the textbook but it was a good resource to reference. | GREAT PROFESSOR, love him"
"Roychowdhury, Lipika","Fair teacher and nice lecturer. Very helpful if you see her after class and ask questions. Just doesn't reply to emails much. | Better than Hove, she actually taught the material and did plenty of practice during lectures. I also had her for recitation, she handled recitation well and the practice worksheets were fairly helpful. I wish she took more control of the class over Hove. | The only reason Roychowdhury's score is in the 3s is because of how poorly Hove is as a professor. Avoid this class at all costs. Your GPA will thank me. | For starters at least she properly lectures. However, the lectures did not feel very engaging outside of the few examples that she would do. A majority of the time she would ask for students to volunteer but no one would volunteer since everyone was so confused. | Loved her! She is happy to help you. You have to put the hard work! Chemistry is not easy. | I really liked Dr. RoyChowdhury! You just have to put the hard work and will do well! | Prof Roychowdhury is pretty good, much better than Hove. She goes much slower in lecture, speaks more clearly, and she goes through countless examples very thoroughly. She makes some mistakes in her work though, which can be confusing. Otherwise, she can really help you if you reach out to her. It's a hard class but effort/practice goes a long way. | Dr. Roychowdhury's lectures were not terrible, but considering the amount of content she had to cover she would often move very quickly. She was very accessible outside office hours and was helpful if you approached her for help. Keeping up with the practice problems is probably the best thing you can do, they are very similar to exam questions. | She is blunt and condescending with a sprinkle of downright rudeness. Doesn't care whether students are struggling/failing. Made constant mathematical mistakes while teaching. | no pls no | Took chem159 in fall2021. Roy is not much better than Hove but she definitely does teach better. However you have no motivation by the time she starts teach because Hove taught the first half of the semester. Unlike Hove, she is not funny so I would not want to take her again. The course is simply put, bad, and everyone failed the exams. | Professor Roychowdhury is amazing! She's super sweet and is glad to explain questions during and after lectures. She does go a little fast sometimes, but she does many practice problems. There are also tons of problems about each chapter on Canvas. | She teaches the 2nd half of Chem 159, and she is definitely a lot better at teaching than the first professor. If you want to succeed in this class, you do have to do some studying on your own, even though she goes over some examples during lectures. She does have a bit of a strict tone, but that's only because she wants students to participate. | Reads off the lecture slides then expects you to know what you're doing. I watched maybe 5 lectures before deciding to just teach myself from the textbook because watching the lecture were a waste of time. Do the eLearning practices and read the textbook to prepare for tests/quizzes. I did above average on tests/quizzes and still got a C+. | Prof Roychowdhury was amazing!! You ABSOLUTELY need to work hard yourself, but she has a ton of office hours / opportunities for you to get your doubts cleared. Go to ALL those sessions and ask any questions you have. She explains everything super clearly, so if you really try to understand and work hard, you will actually start to like chem. | to put it nicely, this was one of the worst classes I've ever taken. The professor does not respond to emails, gave an unnecessarily large amount of HW (which btw is extremely hard), and her exams are nowhere near what we learn in lectures. She just reads off her PowerPoints and then expects students to be able to answer questions. | I took this class during the pandemic so she recorded all of the lectures. She flew through the powerpoints so it was difficult to keep up. I had to do a lot of practice and study by myself. The tests were not too difficult because they were from Elearning. Make sure to study for the weekly quizzes they make up a good percentage of your grade. | The worst educational experience I've ever had. Very difficult to follow in lecture, moves way too fast. What we learned in lecture was almost never what was on exams and quizzes, so I had to teach myself the entire course. Leaving lecture learning absolutely nothing became a normal occurrence. Doesn't address smaller details of practice problems. | If you want to succeed in CHEM162, you should read the textbook chapter prior to lectures and do a ton of practice problems. Professor RoyChowdhury is very nice and is more than happy to help you if you reach out. She provides ample practice problems and is available via email or office hours to help you individually. She cares for her students. | Professor Roychowdhury was a breath of fresh air compared to Hove. That being said, she wasn't the most engaging. Her lectures are long and boring, but she does go over good examples. You get way more out of reading the textbook than attending her lectures, so make sure you read and do the worksheets. | So Roychowdhury is the professor for the second part of Chem 159 and the first part of Chem 160. She does a good job by going through examples, but she does bore me sometimes. It would be a good idea to go to lectures if you didnt do AP Chem because she does the examples. She is still willing to help students out when they are stuck on things. | EXTREMELY disorganized class, both her and Hove. They messed up the final exams for fall 2019, ended up giving a row the wrong final exams and when pointed out a few days later they blamed the students for not telling them. Then they claimed they would send a mass email, which never came, many people failed, for some it could have been due to that. | I don't understand why her rating is a 3/5, she's a really good chem teacher. I had hove for the first semester and I used to think getting 100s on quizzes were impossible. After I had her, I got 3 back to back 100s! She goes over her time limit most of time to get everything done, but I prefer that over rushing through the whole chapter like hove. | she is really really nice if you take her class. She explains the concept clearly and she always tries to answer all the questions from students. I really enjoy her class. | Shes really nice, unfortunately she just cant teacher chemistry well at all. Be prepared to teach yourself. | Prof Roychowdury manages to lecture very slowly and monotone while covering an insane amount of material. Exams are very similar to worksheets but her lectures DO NOT prepare you for the worksheets and there is not enough time to complete exams. Do not take her class unless you already know chemistry or are capable of teaching it to yourself. | Exams are similar to the weekly homework assignments. Going to lecture and taking notes definitely helps. The examples she gives in class are also reused on exams. Stay on top of your work and you'll be set. She goes more in detail during recitation too if you don't understand. | Her accent was so thick it was difficult to understand. Extremely boring lectures and not a good explainer- had to use the textbook to learn by myself. She's a lot more approachable compared to the others in the chem dept. Her drill and practice questions were so helpful. Exams were extremely similar to the past practice exams she gives. | Her lectures are aggressively boring. The combination of her poor handwriting and accent made it difficult to absorb any info during her lectures. However, she does provide practice material for each topic. Try to get a good TA if you do take her lecture. If you want a good grade in chem you need to do practice problems more than anything. | Lipika .. I want to like you but you make it so difficult. Practice exams are easy but actual exams make you rethink your whole life. The first exam was easy but she suspected that we cheated so she made exam 2 and the final so much harder. I appreciate her giving extra credit. HAVE to do well on quiz & HW bc they are a huge chunk of yr grade. Bleh | Absolutely terrible teacher. Although I passed this course, she literally made me rethink if I wanted to go to college. | I really like Professor Roychowdhury because she led me in the right direction whenever I was having a problem. If you take her classes, be sure to ask her any questions you have and she will definitely take the time to help you understand it. Her explanations are clear and very helpful. However, her classes are not easy As. You need to work. | Everyone on this page is saying how boring she, but in reality, she is a great professor. She really knows her stuff and provides exam packets that cover most if not all of the concepts. Some people are lazy and just mad that they have to work for their grade. If you pay attention and understand the practice problems, you will be more than fine. | Horrible professors, if you have her get ready to teach yourself for the reaminder of the course, the averages in the class was a 58 for exams that how bad it was. If you have her better stick with your textbook and youtube, better yet get a private tutor actually. | Class is so boring. I cant remember a time where I stayed awake. | She reads off the slides and she is awful at doing that too. Only reason to go to lecture was to get credit for the attendance grade. Had to self study all of Chem 2. | Dont take her. Shes the worst professor you can have. | Best Proffesor for Sleep162. The main problems with this professor is that she does not provide solutions to the past exams like other proffers and her lectures are not every effective as she goes too fast. For Chem162, your textbook is your best friend as it is very good for explaining things. | Worst professor ever which is why I go to other prof lecture. | Not really a great professor. She just reads slides and assumes that you know it. She speaks monotonous which makes the subject a lot boring. | Easily the worst lecturer Ive had in my 3 years at rutgers. In lecture she ignores students when they ask questions, and even if you go to office hours she wont actually answer your questions, just gives you answers. That is so unhelpful and she is curt and unpleasant to talk to. Surprised that previous reviewers have found her helpful. so awful. | Her Lectures are SOOOOO Boring I can's pay attention for more than 5 min. This is a great class if you want to be put to sleep. | She goes a bit slower than necessary during lectures, but she does a good enough job of explaining the concepts. | Lectures are very helpful because she goes through plenty of examples which mirror quiz/test questions and gives students enough time to solve the problems. However, the lectures do get quite boring. In recitation, she will go over problems clearly and doesn't rush students. Make sure to switch into her recitation section and out of Hove's. | Tbh, she's basura. Like as a person she is nice and she genuinely cares about trying to teach the material but for chem 162 her methods did not work. My biggest issue was her teaching off slides, she would skip to the next slide within 10 secs pretty often without allowing class to write the info. Which made me to end up teaching it to myself | Professor Roychowdhury is a great professor. She presents things in a way that her students can understand and you can tell that she is really dedicated to her students. Overall, if you pay attention and put in effort, you should do fine. | Doctor Roychowdhury is by far my favorite lecturer and section instructor I've ever had. She cares so much about her students and wants the best for all of them. She will always make time if you want to see her out of class and explains things so fluently and makes it a lot easier than it sounds. She is also a very fair grader. 11/10 | Dr.Roy is a great doctor.She is patient and goes over whatever you want during class.She is similar to McGonagall. Attend her office hours regularly and she'll be of extreme help.If you're interested in a chemistry career, she can point you to the right people.Explains material very well and would highly recommend you to take her. | She is really kind, very helpful and very clear. She knows what she is doing, and she explains stuff really well. She helped me get a C from my F. You should definitely try to get her, she is the best chem recitation/lecturer I know on campus! | A very good recitation professor. She is very glad to go over homework problems and sections that you have trouble. Tries to make a very hard subject clear to her students."
"Pramanik, Sanhita","Her lectures are confusing and rushed, and she doesn't go into detail about the practice problems. She was unapproachable and answered with an attitude whenever students asked questions Not a terrible class, but you will definitely have to spend a lot of time teaching yourself. | Avoid taking this professor. I took her for Chem of Life, and her slides were unhelpful. I was always confused about what would be on the exams and quizzes. People in my class said their time was better spent studying on their own while in class rather than listening to her lecture. Class was early and it was hard to follow and pay attention | Nice lady but has a confusing teaching style. She was my recitation teacher for Gen Chem 1 and the whole class was always confused. I spoke to her after class a few times and she always helped me but during the class period, she would zoom through problems without much explanation. Her recitation quizzes are also overly too difficult. | Try not to take this professor. She reads off lecture slides and does not reply to emails. You never know what to study on the exams at all. However, she curves the final grade which is nice. | This was my TA for Chem162. Recitation was online. Very nice and does a good job explaining! Online poll/quiz was always very easy. My one issue with her was her terrible time management. We would usually start class late and she routinely kept us past the end of class. We also only did like 4-5 problems for a 55-minute class which was not ideal. | Pramanik is smart and knows her chemistry, however teaches this course (which is supposed to be for non science majors) as if everyone has knowledge of college-level chemistry. Her exam curves are nice and the course grading as a whole is not too bad, but the lectures are hard as she speeds through them, and has a thick accent. | Avoid taking her. There is no interaction in lectures. She reads off of the powerpoints. Her tests are not related to the practices problems she gave us. But she curve the final grade. | Professor Pramanik has been a total nightmare all year. Her lectures make zero sense, she's extremely rude to students who ask questions and doesn't respond to emails or meet for office hours. I've taught myself everything in this course on my own which is the only reason I'm passing. Avoid taking a course with her. | DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER. Her exams are not straightforward, you never know what to study. All she does is just ramble on and on during lectures and whenever you try to email her she does not answer. Her grading is okay homework is graded heavily, that is the only way i passed, the curve was good. | Not an easy class | Dr. Pramanik is obviously very knowledgeable in her field but her lectures were often very hard to follow. She was also not accessible outside of class. Chemistry is not an easy subject for a lot of people and I feel that her teaching style is somewhat rushed. | If a student asks her a question in class, on a topic we had literally just barely learned about she responds with an attitude as to why they don't know the right answer. I very much struggle with her teaching style, i was pretty good at chemistry in high school but I feel like I know nothing. | She will help outside of class, but rushes practice questions and doesn't go over them in a clear way but she is nice and there to help. Kind of hard to approach though. | took it after withdrawing from the 2 credit orgo lab so it was much easier for me but overall the quizzes were super easy & final exam was easy if you kept up w/ the reading. spent a good 2 hours before lecture and got an A. NOTE her slides are not all that is on the quizzes a lot of it was from the lab book."
"Hove, Emmanuel","Without a doubt very knowledgeable chemist. Unfortunately he is as bad a teacher as he is knowledgeable in chemistry. Condescending and expects students to know everything the minute it's mentioned. Also has horrible writing and is very hard to understand with his thick accent. Also cannot stop saying ""You see?"" I think he said it 100 times. | Mid terms were very hard, finals were standardized and easier. Worst professor I've ever had. | If you have him as a recitation TA i feel bad for you. Had him as one, quizzes were hard and covered content that did not matter in the midterm or finals and were barely mentioned in the chapters. study harder than you ever have before for a decent grade. if you were good at chemistry in high school you will NOT be good at chemistry here. trust me. | Lectures were straight comedy. Be prepared to have a good time, then go home and learn it yourself. | fire him he's sarcastic even ur nice and with hi alone | Completely destroyed my sense of purpose. | I wish I could give a zero. But I can't, so I give him a ONE. | bro sold me | Professor Hove wasn't very useful nor showed demonstration of knowledge of his topics. He focused more on being ""funny"" (which he wasn't too much) instead of teaching us the topics. Instead of instilling knowledge with his own examples, he instead read off pearson slides at lectures. I feel like I learned all of chemistry by myself. | Just get this class over with and as long as you don't need any higher level chem past gen 2 like orgo just take gen 2 over the summer at a cc. | I took AP Chemistry in the past so was expecting to do well by simply reviewing the material however you will not do well by simply going to lectures as you dont learn anything there. Study on your own by doing as much practice problems as possible and good luck on the quizzes! Graded by 2 midterms, a final, and 5 quizzes each with 3 questions. | Was never at office hours and did not want to help you if you were confused. He refused to give me the .13 I needed to pass the class. | Be prepared to self study everything as the lectures are pretty useless. | An intro level course having ~50% midterm averages feels offensively bad, at least if this was a more difficult course it would make sense. Prof Hove is not understandable during his lectures and they are useless. I luckily vaguely remembered most of the course from 10th grade chemistry, however for most people this will be a struggle. | Orgo is by no means an easy subject, but Hove does his best at explaining. I highly recommend office hours because he will recognize you and be kinder when answering questions. REALLY read and understand the textbook, do practice problems, study until you can do reactions and mechanisms with ease. If you put the work in, you can do it | Do not bother going to lecture. His lectures consist of reading the textbook chapter summaries. And, every time somebody asked a question, he responded with ""That's chemistry for you *laughs*"" or something equally unhelpful. Skip the lectures and watch Muniz's recorded lectures instead, if you actually want a good grade. | I thought I was good at chemistry BEFORE I attended this class. Please be aware that his lectures are extremely fast paced and I did not find it useful attending them. He also does not do a good job of explaining difficult topics if you were to ask questions during lecture. If you take this course, self study and review past ACS exams for midterms. | Terrible communicator. We were told the final grading scheme the day before the final. Don't bother going to lectures. You're better off using the materials posted for the course, such as the lecture videos, practice exams, slides, etc. Using these resources, I managed to get a B by studying for quizzes/exams ~2 days before each. | Prof lectured expecting you to know everything. If a person had questions he would patronize and admonish them for not knowing. Although when he did answer questions, I found the explanations to be very helpful, so I asked anyways knowing that I'd be demeaned. I could see the passion in his eyes, he just had no sympathy for people struggling. | Ableist. Antagonized me, specifically. Called me slow. ODS nightmare. I stopped attending his lectures, switched to self-learning entirely and my grades actually improved. If you plan to go to lectures, do not pick this professor. | Professor Hove is funny and does a good job keeping students engaged, but does quite a poor job at conveying the necessary information. He is very smart and definitely has a great understanding of orgo, but does not teach well at all. He is very opposed to using slideshows and almost exclusively teaches using practice problems. | The class itself is notorious for being difficult but it is possible to do well if you learn ahead. As for the professor, he does not teach but rather flips through pages and talks about how we should already know everything. Publicly judges you if you ask a question in class. Better off learning on your own or taking someone else. | Though funny and enthusiastic about chem, Hove is oddly hostile to questions during lecture, and uses lecture time inefficiently, where he spends time rambling about loosely related topics and rushes through lecture slides. Don't bother going to lecture; study the lecture slides yourself, do the posted study material and it's possible to get an A | Hove is a cool person and very funny, but he is really bad at lecturing. He just reads off the slides and doesn't answer questions in the most clear way. I stopped attending lectures all together and got a B+ anyway even though I hate chemistry, so I'd say don't even waste your time with his lectures, slides get posted. Go to recitation though. | Course material is pretty light, professor himself is a ""tough love"" kinda guy. If you read the textbook and take his class serious you'll do great. Funny too, would recommend. | Make sure to ask around about how to do well in the class from upperclassmen. I would say going to lecture helps keep you on pace and shows what you need to be learning while all the learning should be done on your own from the materials in modules. Hove is very kind and if you put a lot of effort and work in the n you will do great. Curve is Crazy | Never Take him | Pray You never get him | Professor Hove is comical, knowledgeable, and demanding. Show up to lecture, read the textbook, and practice. He will like you. | Emmanuel Hove is the GOAT. He is hilarious. He signed a guy's chest mid-semester before he switched out w Roychowdury. The class applauds after every lecture. He holds a red straw for seemingly no reason- icon. ALso he's EIGHTY??? He could literally be 60 I wouldn't notice. Thanks for a great semester HOVE !! | Stay away. Far, far away. Just NO. | Hove was not all that bad... yes he read off the slides, but he was funny and made lectures less boring. He is very passionate about what he teaches. Just make sure to study all the slides and worksheets he gives and you'll do good. | Dr. Hove is one of the best professors I've had. He is a master of chemistry, which made him an incredible lecturer to learn from. He truly cares about his students and wishes to see them put in hard work. Orgo can be hard but he literally outlined everything we needed to cover for this class in lectures. I don't understand the negative reviews. | Imo he is a better professor than Roychowdhury and its not even close. He's funny and answers multiple questions during lecture. He engages everyone in lecture by doing practice problems and is willing to check them if u ask. Study outside of class bc chem is a little difficult. 9/10 Professor. I would take him again but I hate chemistry. | Hove is one of the worst professors most engineers at Rutgers will be stuck with. Lectures consist of the prof. reading off printed slides, and there are very few resources available in the Gen Chem class to further deepen your knowledge of the subject. Only silver lining is Hove can be amusing from time to time, but overall horrible class. | This class has been a total breeze! From day one, the professor made everything super easy to understand and always kept the mood light. He's super nice and genuinely cares about helping everyone succeed. I actually looked forward to class every day! So sad it's over, but so grateful for this semester! #BestProfessorEver | *he cannot teach gen chem * he moves very quickly * he makes students feel bad about asking questions * lecture content does not reflect exam * grades are so bad that passing is generally in the 30s he's very funny and extremely iconic, a walking legend and a meme, but he's not a good professor for gen chem, take the SAS version for you GPA. | Professor Hove is notorious among freshman for being a horrible professor. He is extremely unclear and makes no attempt to answer questions in class. Class averages were in the 40's and overall he is just a horrible professor. I had for chem 159 and 160 and it was just brutal. | Hove's lectures can be tough to follow, but he's actually really helpful during office hours and extra sessions. Lots of practice problems to work through - just be sure to use all the resources like the textbook and Unstuck ai. Not the easiest class, but doable with some effort. | youll basically have to teach urself this class but its really funny so its worth he'll sing u a song for good luck before midterms | istg bro is ZOOMING......very rough with students and goes off topic a lot, reads off a printed powerpoint and then talks about tea.... i've learned so much more independently than in his class | Just not good, do not recommend | I have never encountered a professor as ineffective as this one. It is the educator's responsibility to teach, not to rush through a slideshow. Many of my peers would agree that this professor struggles to convey the course material, leaving us to teach ourselves despite paying for instruction. | Bad professor overall. He goes through lectures very quickly and expects us to know everything like its simple. Will call you out for answering things wrong and is not very good at answering questions after class. Don't take him at-least over the summer he will make orgo 2x harder to understand. Average for final was 40% so not very good professor. | If you are an engineer and you are going to take this class, my advice would be to just not. This man makes chemistry so much harder than it needs to be and I know this as a fact, I'm not just a bad student. I dropped this class and instead took general chemistry with rabeony and it is MUCH better. Finished his class with an A. Take that class. | Worst Chem professor at Rutgers | You have to learn almost everything on your own, because he can't teach. Very rude to students, consistently goes off topic, and didn't teach 25% of the content on the department's final (the highest grade was a 76%). However, curves nicely (final A range was 70-100. Says something about his teaching.) Avoid at all costs, at least in the summer. | Hove can't teach well, uses another professor's slides, and is very unaccommodating. Many students took Orgo1 with a different professor and didn't learn a few reactions that he taught his students, but he didn't care and included the reactions in questions anyway. He also blames students for things he forgets to do. Terrible, but I did learn stuff | Even though he's funny, he can't teach. He can read slides though! | Where to start... He grades very rough with very little partial credit. Our final exam should be out of our 12 class chapters but consisted of 3-4. The average for the final was a 80/200. He doesn't help outside of class, and is very argumentative with students, causing no-one to want to ask questions. Take Sethi or someone else, not worth it."
"Khurana, Vandana",This was my TA for Chem161 recitation. She did an amazing job going over problems and explaining. Compared to other TAs I've had she is very good at teaching! She also did a good job at time management and answering questions. Recitation quizzes were sometimes difficult but were always based on what we did in that recitation. Definitely recommend!
"Abeywickrama, Chandima","She does not explain anything, and yells at people even though we are VIRTUAL. She will target people for wrong answers, she said that if you miss a recitation that you cant make it up. She leaves up questions for like 5 seconds and expects everyone to do the math instantly but it takes her 20 min to get through a single example. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!! | I had her online for Chem 161 recitation and she would read the question from the chat out loud but not answer it. She would join the zoom link late most of the time and give very little time for the quiz. I would recommend taking the recitation in-person if you actually needed your questions answered. | Horrible to work with and doesn't care much for her students or those that need to listen to her. I didn't even get a choice when I took her for chem, if you do have a choice go to someone else. | Take someone else. She cant teach orgo, shes better at ranting and telling you how to study for orgo. Was not happy that the class did good on exam 1, made exam 2 and final harder and worth more points. Lecture notes are just pictures of reactions and doesnt explains. Expects you to know the textbook. Better to teach yourself the class."
"Braunstein, Erik","Erik looks like Jim from the office so he's pretty hot. His classes are super long and boring and when I had him he was absent for half the semester so I received an automatic A. Assigns a paper every two-three weeks and the midterm is open notes so make sure you write down his power points. Not bad but not interesting. | Erik is a really clear and accurate professor. He is always willing to help if you have any questions and he is funny in a nerdy kind of way. Also he is hot. He offers a lot of extra credit so take him up on it, but like not like that. On the test there are like extra questions as long as you try he gives you good points!! Keep up with homework:D | Erik is always super clear and always ready to send you feedback or help with problems. Good guy. Participate in class! Him knowing your name can make a big difference! | Really nice guy. He tries his best to make the information relatable and interesting. The course title was misleading, I thought I'd learn how to argue more effectively when in reality the course focuses on formal and theoretical argument. If you pay attention it's an easy A. My only complain is he said ""Um"" and ""Uh"" a lot, which got distracting. | He's the best! His lectures get boring sometimes (just the material though) he tries to spice it up. Email him or ask questions in class so he knows your name. Every homework has extra credit and you get a cheat sheet (front&back paper) for the midterm and final. You need to pay attention to lecture. Lots of test questions straight from slides. | After taking this class, I realized I am not a true fan of Philosophy. Overall, I felt he could of engaged with the class better such as using power points. He's very technical and it can get boring. There was a quiz every week, one paper due for Midterm, and one paper due for the Final. Yet, he handed back grades in late. | A good young teacher. He taught current and moral issues well, one quiz a week based on that day's reading, and 2 philosophy essays based on a moral issue you get to pick, like abortion, the crime rate, prisons, etc. I enjoyed being in his class, one minor issue, i'm still waiting for him to post my grade. Sometimes He fell behind in grading. | Really good teacher (I think he's a grad student). One midterm, one take home final, and 10 responses due each week (like a pg each). Lots of chances for extra credit, and you learn a lot too. Cool guy, but kinda boring stuff (I mean it's philosophy, haha). | Great professor"
"Sangari, Harpal","Have for online recitation; hes so good! I wish he was my actual professor. The way he explains it and the problems he does make it a lot easier to understand. He does have a bit of an accent but it doesnt affect your understanding as long as you pay attention. | He is definately one of the best, if not the best, recitation instructor for General Chemistry. He goes over a variety of problems and really helps you understand concepts that may have been unclear during lecture. Also, he focuses on problems/concepts that tend to appear on exams, so it is evident that he really wants his students to succeed. | I don't know what these people are talking about it either. This guy was horrible. He has a super thick accent and he goes super fast. He grades extremely hard. 1 little mistake and you fail your quiz | I don't know what these kids below are talking about but this guy was absolutely horrible. He was completely impossible to understand with the thickest accent. He gave you attitude if you asked a question or asked him to repeat something because you're used to speaking ENGLISH. Definitely do not reccomend him if you plan on passing Chem. | He's an AWESOME chem recitation instructor. Literally passed my class class because of him. He made everything seem so much easier than the professor. He's also very nice, but dont take advantage of him. Don't just go to recitation the last few minutes of class just to take the test. He wont let you. But overall, HES AN AWESOME PROFESSOR! | One of the better recitation instructors, he goes over problems that are more likely to appear on the exam and tries his best to help students. You will probably learn more in recitation than lecture. | Definitely one of the best teachers I have ever had. Although he does have a thick accent that threw me off guard on day 1 everyone in my class got accustomed to it. If you are in his class DO NOT switch out because in comparison with who my friends have had he is the best. Learned all my chemistry from him. Agree with the other comments on exams. | I absolutely love this professor! He is very helpful and sweet. doesn't get annoyed or rude even if you ask a million questions. he also tells you what can show up on exams.i recommend to go to his recitation to learn chemistry.before the final exam, i lost my book and he lent me his :) | pretty easy to understand, better than the lectures anyways | Harpal Sangari is an amazing chem recitation instructor. he explains everything with ease, tells you what will probably show up on the test, and does his best to make sure you know what you are doing. i basically learned all my chem from him, not the lecture. i had him for both chem 101 and 102 recitation. he's amazing, trust me! | i honestly liked him as a recitation teacher. whoever is writing negative things about him obviously never attended class. he tells you what problems will most likely be on the exams, and he helped me a lot. he has a thick accent & he speaks fast. those are the only negative things about him. i recommend him. | I had him as a recitation teacher over the summer. He made it very easy and I got a B+ final grade purely from the way he ran the class. Maybe he is different over the summer but I'd recomend him for anyone that struggles in chemistry. Doesn't matter who professor in lecture is. | SOOOO! ANYONE WHO HAD HIM FOR RECITATION WOULD KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. HA! HE SUCKED | Tough to understand, when he goes over homework problems (which he picks..it would be considerably better if he asked us which ones were giving us problems), he seems to pull out problem solving strategies out of nowhere, which can get confusing. He does indeed know his chemistry tho. | He goes waay to fast, doesn't even turn around from the board to check if anyone has questions, which is not a good thing for a recitation leader to do. Other than that, you get distracted trying to decipher some of his words as he has a strong Indian accent. He seems like a nice person and I gotta give it to him, he really knows his Chemistry!"
"Guerra, Francesca","Professor Guerra is sweet, very smart, and enthusiastic about the subject. However, the class is generally just really difficult to get through—her office hours are a great resource to review the lecture material. (Especially since the lectures can feel like they're going too fast.) | She's very kind and definitely cares about Chemistry, however, she's not very good at teaching concepts well. I had to self-study a ton using the textbook, which is honestly better at teaching Chem than her. If you have her, please self-study because you cannot reliably depend on her for a good grade. | She's very sweet and funny and will put in the effort to help during her office hours. However, she doesn't pace herself well in lectures, though her accent isn't too bad. She also includes material that you'll never see on the exams. I suggest attending Langowski's lectures early on rather than a month in. | Her accent is hard to understand and she has trouble finding the right words some times. She definitely cares about the subject, but she just was not the best teacher. I felt confused and unclear a lot of the time. Try to get Langowksi but so much of chem is teaching yourself bc all of the profs kinda suck in their own ways. Good luck solider | I didn't exactly HATE this class, but being in a lecture hall at 8 AM is... bad. Prof. Guerra herself is entertaining but participation is often asked of her students. | Nice professor as long as you're not being disruptive in lecture. Holds offices hours after every class and is super willing to help and provide support when needed. Lectures are sometimes super boring and repetitive, but as long as you do the practice questions you shouldn't worry. | Literally the human equivalent of sleeping pills. Her slides out of order, she rarely posts the materials she uses and her voice can put an insomniac to sleep. Avoid if possible. | a little hard to understand sometimes. nice lady, though. terrible at answering questions. whenever I raised my hand, she would either not call on me, or not explain at all. still did well, so it's not the end of the world if you get her. | Professor Guerra was very sweet and helpful, but not the best at explaining things. Her lectures were organized okay, but she was not very aware of time and tended to rush through slides. Because of her consistent poor pacing, she would not completely cover material until 2 days before the exam. If you want better lectures in Chem 1, take Langowski | I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not enjoy chemistry. I thought it was terribly ran, although not all Pr. Guerra's fault. I found Guerra to be sometimes difficult to understand and moved through slides WAY too quickly. 3 midterm exams which I felt content was unfair. 2 weekly quizzes also take lots of personal time each week. | Professor Guerra's accent is difficult to understand, and her lectures did not cover all material in this already difficult course. Her slides were also somewhat difficult to follow. While she is friendly, I would not recommend taking her for Rutger's already notoriously difficult chem course. | I'd read the textbook before going to her lecture and during lecture she filled in the gaps that needed clarity. If you focus in her lectures it makes the exams fairly doable. I had an issue with many of my Elearning HW quizzes being graded wrong, once I told her, she got on it and fixed it fairly quickly. I am taking her again for Chem 162! | She was a very helpful professor. Office hours and lectures were very good. No matter the professor, chemistry is a difficult course. She makes it much more enjoyable. | Professor guerra was always very accessible and really helpful whether it was office hours or lecture. She genuinely wants you to do well in her class and will take her time to help you when you need. She was a big reason as to why I did well in 162. Nonetheless, you will still have to put in a lot of work on your own as 162 is not an easy class. | While her lectures themselves aren't outstanding, prof. Guerra is very caring and helpful, and her office hours were an incredible resource throughout the entire semester. | Chem 1 was very difficult, but the same people that blame the professors are the ones that don't show up to lectures or study sufficiently. Professor Guerra was very helpful during office hours and if you participate in lectures you'll learn better. Come prepared to class having done some reading on the topic as lectures do fly by. taking her again | Guerra is hard to access because she doesn't answer her emails often. there is no curve in the class and the averages of the tests were super low. she has a strong passion for chem but that doesn't mean everyone in the class is good at it, she doesn't want to help you unless you're super good at the subject already. i recommend not taking her | She is an ok chemistry teacher. The lectures are hard to follow, especially if you don't read the textbook before attending. Her accent also makes it hard for some to comprehend, but I found little problem with it. The class is about as challenging as STEM classes get. You have to put in your work to get a good grade. Stay on top of concepts. | Dr. Guerra was a decent professor but I don't think I would take her again. She tried her best to help her students, however, her accent made chemistry a little difficult to understand. | The accent is really really difficult to understand!!! Although she tried her best to teach the course, she didn't think about the hard situation for the students, she just taught the course and left the rest to the course coordinator. Not Helpful! | She was not a good professor. Accent makes everything 10x harder to understand | The Course is really harsh, no curve and no homework to pull your gpa up. Quizes everyweek and exams are the only ones that affect your grade. Professor Guerra is nice, but she might not be your best choice because she has a strong accent. She reply emails slow. Langowosky is the best choice for you to pass this course. | She's nice. Really has good intentions and has passion for Chemistry. However, her accent can be confusing and she is part of the Chem department which can make her harder. But anyway, she's very passionate and usually has something special for us during the holidays. Maybe not to learn and understand, but definitely a good teacher. | Her accent is intimidating but not bad and you get used to it. She's definitely a better professor than most and she's especially helpful during office hours. You can bring her homework problems and she'll do them with you and gives good advice. She's one of the most approachable professors and she actually wants you to succeed- her notes are good. | I ended up going to another teacher's lectures. She's good and really does care but her teaching style did not work for me since I need it to be broken down more and it was just very fast with a lot to do and study on your own. | A lot of people say Professor Guerra is a really tough professor, however you get out what you put in. Guerra is super kind and will answer anything you ask her. Read the textbook and go to office hours and you'll be fine! I would highly recommend Guerra's class, especially if you need an opportunity to learn how to be more independent! | She is really caring but has a horrible, really difficult to understand accent. She also talks really slowly and we don't even get through all the lecture material half the time. She is disorganized and never knows how to explain questions in a straightforward manner. Please avoid her if you can! | Many people complain about her accent, it is not hard to understand at all. She's a nice person and is willing to take time to answer questions from students. I was never able to go to her office hours, but I heard they were very helpful | IDK why everyone's complaining ab her accent cuz she is totally understandable I PROMISE!!! It's not bad!! However, she just wasn't a great teacher. I attended other teachers' lectures & self-taught A LOT (the textbook is your bff). She's nice & does take time to answer any questions if you have, tho. I had her during the pandemic. | It's gen chem so it will be difficult but she is an amazing professor who cares about her students and their success. Be sure to go to her office hours. | Strong accent.. which makes the class harder than it already is | Went to her office hours a couple times and they didn't help much. Mostly used a different professor's notes to learn, and I felt like I had to mostly teach myself. Her lectures were insanely boring but attendance is taken and there's clicker questions. | Her classes are very lecture heavy and she would read straight off the slides. However, she does post power points online, and because attendance is mandatory, I would go to lecture and put in my headphones and review the material myself. It was a lot of self-teaching. | She's literally so sweet, and she's very excited to teach. People complain about her accent, it's not hard to understand, people can just be ignorant. She teaches you what you need to know but its up to you to study to do well. | People don't give her the credits she deserves simply because of her accent. But if you can pay attention despite that and follow along, she's very resourceful. If you have any difficulties, her office hours are a great way to get caught up. She is caring and willing to walk through problems with you. I am happy to be taking her for chem 2. | Shes really nice. If you have any problems in solving online homework, she is willing to help. She points out similar questions that will gonna be in the exams in the exam review session. I got an A in this course but I almost self-studied by another instructors lecture notes | Basically self-studied for Chem 161 by using other instructor's lecture notes, the textbook, and homework problems/past exams. Professor Guerra is very sweet but her lectures, although mandatory, do not really reflect the material that shows up on exams. Her accent is understandable and she is quite helpful when approached before/after class. | Great teacher! Most reviews seem to be skewed but most people who do bad in this class are the ones who sit on their laptop every lecture instead of taking notes (which is more effective when hand written) and genuinely trying to understand the concepts. Her strong accent seemed hard at first but its really not that bad | Trying to understand her accent is bad enough, but her frequent stuttering makes it even worse. It's hard to follow along and tbh my self-studying is what got me an A. Study other profs' lecture slides, read the textbook, and do the textbook problems. I attended every lecture but didn't learn a single thing lol | Is currently two lectures behind, and doesn't simplify complicated concepts well enough for us to understand. | Knows the subject very well and she's passionate about what she teaches. Also very approachable and kind, has no problem pausing lecture to answer questions from not understanding what was just went over or hypothetical questions. Does many example problems that helps reinforce the material currently going over. Focus in lecture and you'll do fine | Explains concepts decently, but often goes off topic. When she delivers her lectures, she basically reads off and says almost the exact same thing as the slide says. Can sometimes make things more complicated. | Sweetest lady ever but she doesn't relay the information in a concise and efficient way. She complicates an already complicated subject and it becomes difficult to follow her train of thought. I have to teach myself everything and its incredibly time consuming and difficult. You have to read the textbook an find outside help to be able to so well. | Although she is a sweet lady, her lectures barely cover what is discussed on the homework or quizzes. They're a complete waste of time, but you can't skip them because she takes attendance. If you do end up taking her course, then good luck. Chemistry is hard enough even with a good professor. | Professor Guerra gets a bad rap because of her accent but it really isn't that hard to understand. She is a very caring person and she wants to see students succeed. Her lectures are entertaining and great as far as the chemistry department is concerned. She is always available for help and shows many example problems. | The sweetest lady you'll ever meet, but not the best lecturer. Get over her accent, bc Rutgers is full of teachers with accents. In order to fully grasp the material, you HAVE to do outside work, meaning read the textbook, read other teacher's notes, and independent study. It sucks, but it's the only way to learn in any chem class in Rutgers. | she's the type of prof that makes a difficult subject even harder to understand. the exams are totally different from what you go over in class. & in class, she goes fast & doesnt explain anything its hard to even know whats going on. i wouldnt recommend at all. the way the class is run (w/ the online hw & online recitation) it hurts more than help | A lot of people are saying her accent is hard to understand but it's really not. Like buddy if you can't understand her - you probably can't understand Texans either LOL. also Shes really sweet!! & always helps! She gave candy for Halloween + all chem students get the same tests so it doesn't matter who you get. Use kimmels notes - his are better | She's one of the nicer chem profs and will try her best to help you. If you can't handle a moderate accent she's not for you. Her lectures and powerpoints are solid and so long as you do the recommended problems from the book and understand most of mastering chem, you'll be fine | Lectures have nothing to do with the class"
"Sahni, Seema","Avoid this professor!!! | Orgo is a hard subject if you don't study or practice outside of class, SI are so much recommended it. Sahni does not give hw but her worksheet are real helpful and worth to do them. | Prof. Sahni is the best orgo chem 1 professor period. I appreciate that she genuinely cares about her students and wants to make sure we understand the content. She is a very hardworking professor. Make sure you do your part most importantly and do the worksheets that she gives to the class. Also work in groups to study together. Thank you Prof. | Professor Sahni was amazing and I couldn't have been more lucky to have her as my Orgo 1 professor. You have to come to class and pay attention in the lecture. Have a study group and her slides are very helpful. Orgo is a very hard class but she makes it very understandable and is willing to work with you outside of class. | Took her for orgo 1 the first time and dropped then retook it again with her and passed. She explains things very well and her slides are organized and provides lots of practice problems and examples. I wish she taught orgo 2 she's a great professor. | Everyone should take orgo with Dr. Sahni. Excellent, comprehensive lectures. Helps students out whenever she can (esp those who show up to class/make an effort).Genuinely cares about her students success (answers questions w/out belittling students). Orgo is a notoriously difficult course, so dont slack and put in the work - itll be worth it | I had Sahni for Gen Chem 2 and Orgo 1 she's great and really nice. you can always ask her questions and her jamboards are helpful. She is the better option for chem. Make sure you come prepared for class and read the material it's hard to get by w/o it. Extra credit is offered. As for as test in Orgo Stokes creates the material so yeah. | For class, during COVID, we had about 6 exams total throughout the semester. You have to study for the exams weeks before (not days before) or else you won't pass them. She gives a lot of extra credit but you have to work and study to get it. She explains things extremely well! She's great! There is no DQ's, only a few quizzes, and HW. | Hands down the best Orgo professor at Kean. I took her after dropping the class twice in previous semesters and she came highly recommended. She makes the material clear and concise, and takes time to explain if you have questions after class. The subject is difficult, but if you don't do well in this class, you just didn't put enough time in. | Do not ask her any questions in class or she will make it you look so dumb in front of the whole class. Never expect a good response to the answers!! | SHE IS THE BEST!!!! she explains everything so well and actually cares about her students. She gives so many examples and worksheets and goes over them in class. she will do everything she can to help you pass. you definitely need to study a lot to understand the material, if you take the class seriously and put in the effort you can get an A. | Prof Sahni is a very good professor. She breaks down the material well and is caring. The only problem is that she does not make the exams, so sometimes there are things that were not reviewed in class on the test. She is really easy to talk to outside of class, but she does expect a lot from her students. This is not an easy class, but she is good | Honestly, I was terrified to take this class, but she is very, very, great at teaching! Really happy that I took her for organic Chem 1, and now super excited that I have her for Orgo 2!! She is well organized and all she asks is that you study at home and practice. | I took Professor Sahni for both Orgo I & II and she is awesome! She keeps it simple and only teaches what we will be tested on. Her lectures are clear and simple. She is always enthused to answer students questions and works out problems when someone is stuck. | Very good professor! She understands that the subject is hard and makes it as understandable as possible. She is very nice and her tests coincide perfectly with her slides. I am taking her again for Orgo 2 and I am glad that Kean was able to hire such a wonderful professor. Plus she gives extra credit. | Took her summer and had to wait for next spring to take her Could be a little tough at the beginning as you get used to her, once there she will make chemistry flow nice and easy Helps a lot when you need her and makes class interesting not boring. If the class is overall doing well she might give extra credit and no curve She just the best | Professor Sahni is a great teacher. She is very well organized, detailed and very patient with students. Her class is easy to understand even thought material is tough to learn. Students should expect to learn a lot however timing and effort is key in order to do well in her class. | Very confusing and never on campus. DO NOT TAKE! Made numerous errors on students grades | GREAT PROFESSOR!"
"Dey, Gangotri","Class seems slow and prof dey generates no interest for recitation so it seems more like a chore to be there than wanting to do practice problems and learn. She isn't too good at explaining stuff either she just does problems, asks if everyone understands it briefly, and then moves on. | Had her for recitation, they're SOOO boring and I HAVE to attend, like why. I didn't understand half of what she said and would literally have preferred a recorded video so I could skip through what she was saying and just do the problems and move on with my life. Level of difficulty 5 is for difficulty of understanding her... | Professor Dey is very caring and really wants all her students to do well. She was my recitation instructor for CHEM 2. She encourages participation and quickly learned all of our names. She will stop and ask if anyone is confused and doesn't make you feel bad if you are lost. She is also very accessible over email if you need more help. | Dr. Dey was my recitation professor for Gen Chem 161. She was a great help when it came to understanding and applying the course material. The questions she chose to go over in recitation really helped me better understand the topics in chem. She gives us time to answer the question, and if anyone had any trouble she would be glad to help them."
"Orbe, Paul","Paul Orbe teaches at NJCU for Chem lab. He seems tough and aggressive at first but along the way he's actually really caring and wants you to do well. Don't slack off though, he will only work with you if you're willing to put the work. Overall, take him! He's not bad | He is very nice and understanding when students needed more polls to unlock the quiz. the 55 minutes fly by without even knowing it. I would definitely recommend him. he teaches Thursday 6:55 - 7:50 and 8:25 - 9:20"
"Langowski, Bryan","What a king. What an icon. I have tried going to four different chemistry professors throughout both semesters, and he is the ONLY one who is able to explain the concepts clearly. Chem 161 and 162 are NOT easy classes whatsoever, but you can do well in them, and he is partially to thank for that. You also need to do a lot of work on your own. | HE IS SOOOOO OVERRATED. To be frank, he just talks the whole lecture about random details that are irrelevant. He will specifically tell you to memorize stuff you DO NOT need for the exam! He will lash out on a student for no reason and then go on as if he hasn't done anything wrong. There are better professors out there... do not take him!! | I took Langowski for Gen Chem 161 at Rutgers this past Fall Semester 2024. Although attendance is not mandatory, I highly suggest going to every lecture because he does a great job explaining concepts. Additionally, to do well in Gen Chem 161, do all of the practice problems that he posts in his Day Lecture Schedule and the ELearning Practice too. | best gen chem professor, i love the detail and format of his slides. although he can be intimidating to ask questions to, he explains the concepts the best and includes practice problems in his lectures. to study: use TA practice sessions, previous exams, and recitation problems. | Students treat this man as if he is a god; he is VERY overrated. He only gets worshipped this much because hes the only chem professor with a clear accent. He was often rude to me the few times I went to office hours and often made many careless errors. He is also prone to lying about what to know on the exam. He shouldn't be as respected as he is. | Dr. Langowski is one of the best professors I have taken at Rutgers. His lectures are detailed and straight to the point. He made all of summer session 1 a great experience. Would definitely have him as a professor again. | Dr. Langowski was probably the best lecturer I've had at Rutgers so far. Clearly interested in the material, communicates it very well, and is accessible outside of class for questions. If you're taking Chemistry 161, take him if you can. | Terrible. The exams were not at all like the course. | I had a different prof for first sem and having him second sem made all the difference. He is the best chem prof at Rutgers. Gen Chem is really hard at Rutgers, but he really helped by breaking down the concepts. Even if he is not your prof, go to his lectures especially on exam review days. | This professor is a literal genius. Best chemistry professor here at Rutgers. Helped break down really complicated questions and made them very simple and easy to understand. Though it's hard, it really prepares you for the MCAT and for ACS Sections. Great prof | Great lecturer who teaches in an effective way and has good humor. Filling out his prelecture notes during lecture is the best way to take notes, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Only downside is you don't know your grade at all until it is finalized. Practice exams are similar to midterms and ACS official guide is just like the final. | THE best chem professor at rutgers. Teaches material well and explains things in detail. | Understood the lectures but make sure to not fall behind because it may seem like the course and each class moves very fast | Chem 161 was torture but Dr. Langowski helped make it a bit better. A bit boring at times but straightforward and a decent teacher overall. The best chem professor at RU- students skip their own lectures to go to his. Do well on the elearning weekly quizzes as they can save your grade. Highly recommend | Chem 161 is no joke. Langowski really did try to prepare us all for the really rough midterms. Attending lectures and e-learning problems are not enough to pass the class. I recommend doing all of the textbook problems. Overall, hardest and most stressful class I took at Rutgers. However, Langowski was a sweet and helpful guy. | This class was so rough for me. I wish I knew extended chem 1 was an option instead of taking chem 161. Homework-heavy (and heavily weighted on your grade). Read the textbook to understand concepts before going to lecture. Do practice problems EVERY DAY. Sometimes he would answer questions in a complex way and make me more confused. | Extremely lenient and wants everyone in lecture to excel and understand the topics he explains. Put a lot of time into making everything easily digestable and I definitely would not have done nearly as well in chemistry without him. | You can tell how much everyone loves this guy because he would make objectively bad jokes during the lectures and still get laughs. People who aren't registered for his sections show up to his lectures rather than their own. | he explains things well, but you should read textbook beforehand to get a grasp on what he is talking about. he is incredibly helpful during office hours and explains things better one on one imo. | The undisputed chemistry GOAT at Rutgers. There's a reason why people always recommend him. Extremely good for lectures and recitation. Chem will always be hard but he makes it slightly easier. Lectures are fun and he helps simplify such complex topics. You still have to invest a lot of time into practice, but Langowski definitely helps. | Prof langowski is one of the few profs at Rutgers Chem department that make chemistry not awful. I failed chem for engineers and took his class and am doing a lot better. Not only are lectures easy to understand, but exams are pretty generous too. I took the summer semester version so that might play a factor, but I'd def take his class if you can. | Dr. Langowski is the BEST. Chemistry is a hard subject but Dr. Langowski tried his best to simplify and teach the topics in a way that was more understandable. If you have him for recitation or go to his office hours, he explains any questions you may have in such great detail and helps you to make connections to other topics. | He is amazing at what he does. I hate chem so so much (especially at Rutgers) but he made the experience so much better because he was incredible and was really good at simplifying really complicated concepts. Highly recommend taking him. | Professor Langowski was always very kind and willing to teach his students. The class itself is difficult for a lot of students, but his lectures are easy to follow and understand. I have heard from many people that he is the best professor to have for chemistry. | Chem is hard. You're gonna have to spend time reading the textbook and watching lots of videos to understand the topics for the midterms. Prof L tries his best to explain a lot of the stuff but you should still go into lectures with some background knowledge to make it worthwhile. ELEARNING = SAVIOR! Dw if you fail a midterm but learn from mistakes | Chem 161 is a challenging course, but Dr. Langowski makes it bearable. They recommend reading the textbook before coming to class, but Dr. L explains everything in a way that is so easy to understand. Go to his lecture, understand the elearnings, do practice exams, and the textbook problems and you will be good. | Professor Langowski is the best Chem 161 lecturer at Rutgers. His lectures are engaging and he explains concepts well | HE is sooo condensing!! if you want to do well, read textbook, take notes from it, then go to his lectures and ask questions, warning again he is condescending lol, do suggested problems in textbook and in chapter problems (very important!!! once so many of these questions showed up) and make sure to know HW problems. | Dr. Langowski was a great professor who worked hard to make a difficult subject like chemistry easy to understand. If you want to completely understand the course material, you may have to attend his office hours as well. Make sure you really understand the conceptual portion of the course because only going to lecture may not help. | Dr. Langowski is the best professor I've ever had. He is intelligent and cares about teaching. He takes 3/4 question breaks during class in a 350 person lecture hall. His powerpoints are organized and well thought out. He is the reason I actually like Chemistry now lol. The material is extremely difficult but he makes it easier to understand. | Teacher is great. Class is tough. 40% of the grade are weekly quizzes that are super hard for no reason. The rest are the 3 exams and the final. | Dr. Langowski is one of the best for chem I. He really tries his best to make sure you understand the concepts and gives you lots of practice problems. Overall, if his section is open, definitely register as fast as you can. | Words can't describe how much I appreciate Professor Langowski. His lectures are PHENOMENAL--the best powerpoints you can ever get. He's so accessible/organized, always starts on the dot, and office hours are amazing. Chem 162 is not easy but Langowski truly helps you to understand the material so you learn and do well. | Langowski helps a lot with conceptual problems through his lectures and the math problems he gives are usually exam difficulty or even harder. However, he doesn't really go over that many exam difficulty math-based problems during lecture, which means you have to put in a lot of hours into self-studying even with him as a lecturer. | Langowski is def better than any of the other on-season chem professors. His lectures are organized, but the material itself is very difficult. You have to put in a lot of effort to just get a B in this class. Grade is dependent on 40% quizzes and 60% exams. No extra credit or partial credit. Made me dislike chemistry. | While the class itself is quite difficult, Dr. Langowski was a wonderful, patient, and kind instructor who transitioned very well to online classes. He always explains concepts and problems thoroughly and has plenty of real-world examples and practice problems in his notes. | Professor Langowski is a good professor. He explains every question clearly; however, CHEM161 is a hard class as there are no curves or extra credits while your grade is solely depends on your midterm, quizzes and finals. If you want to get an A on this class you would have put a lot of efforts to it. | Best teacher! Basically carried the chem department and was amazing at breaking concepts down and teaching them to students. Always had office hours and would stay extra cause he cared about students before exams. | Best professor in the entire chem department. Do take him if you can. I had an A in the beginning of the course but ended with a B since the last exam and final threw me off a little. Do the practice questions on ELearning and always make sure to go to Langowski's office hours. Not an insanely hard class but you do have to put in work. | His lectures help the most!!!!! DONT WORRY IF YOU DONT HAVE HIM AS A LECTURER. If you're online you can still access all of his lectures and they are the most helpful! DO ALL OF ELEARNING PRACTICE QUESTIONS. | Langowski is the type of rare professor that doesn't overcomplicate every little thing. He provides NEAT and EASY TO FOLLOW powerpoints, explains concepts super clearly, and is very accessible in office hours. The only downside is that his classes get filled up within 5 minutes, so make sure you do add/drop ON THE DOT if you wanna do well in chem. | the saving grace of the chem dep; the class is still mad hard but he actually gives students a chance of doing well; if you can't snipe him, watch his lecture recordings and use his notes--and attend a recitation he teaches if you can; online chem in general was a nightmare--- the exams were all 80% open ended and sig figs count (extra stress smh) | Fantastic professor.. Rutgers chemistry department don't deserve this man. All his sections will fill up in minutes during registration slots. This class is difficult but Lang's method of teaching really provides students with a chance to succeed. | Recorded lecture. Quiz everyweek. HARD midterms. BUTTT those are for any chem class you take with any professor. Langowski is the best of all the chem professors because the way he explains things makes chem easy to understand. there is a reason all his classes get taken up first during registration period. | He is just a great overall professor. His explanations are fantastic and his lectures are the best in the Gen Chem department. It also feels like he actually cares because you can email him a question and he can work through a question for you. He doesn't make you feel bad for asking a question, which is a common theme amongst the gen chem classes. | Such a cool dude but can be hard to keep up with sometimes. Definitely the best professor in the chem department. Take him if you can! I don't think he makes the department exams, but his notes can really help you out with online quizzes/exams. Last resort would be the textbook but its not needed. If you want to excel / pass, Langowski is the man. | The fact that Professor Langowski's sections close immediately speaks for itself. As someone who also was looking for ratings to choose which Professor to take for Chem 1 and 2, Langowski is hands down the only way to have any success. Use schedru to snipe into whatever section fits your schedule. Take it from me, take Langowski and no one else. | Chem isn't an easy A course, but Professor Langowski made it somewhat bearable. He was always cheerful and was really accommodating during the transition to online lectures. The textbook isn't mandatory, but it really helped to solidify some of the concepts taught in the lecture. Would take him again in a heartbeat! | Prob best Chem prof at Rutgers. Chem is not an easy subject, but his slides make it easier to understand and study. His lectures are quite fast and heavy, but you can always go back and review if needed. You have to attend lecture, because of attendance. Not sure if you need textbook, I did and it helped me understand the harder concepts. | Chem isn't an easy A course. You need to put in the effort and time into studying. Attendance is apart of your grade, rightfully so. Chem consists of a lot of info that needs to be taught in a few months, so lectures are fast-paced. He knows what he's talking about. If you do the homework, attend every lecture, and study, you'll get a good grade."
"Kornienko, Anna","Every genchem prof. is bad, except maybe Langowski. But, Kornienko is okay. Read the book before class && add to your notes in lecture. Her accent really is not bad, idk why people keep saying it is, but she can be mean. The most positive point: she holds review sessions before exams, and many of the questions were literally covered on the exam. | I joined the TI program thinking that I could help some chemistry students do well in the course since I know how to study for it, but Kornienko made the TI program unbearable! its way too much work for a measly credit, if she doesn't like a problem that you made then she is very rude and cold, and most of the time she ghosts you if you email her. | Failed this class and was miserable knowing I had to retake it. But, Dr. Kornienko made it a comfortable experience through straight-to-the-point lectures reflected on quizzes/exams. When I struggled, I found her easy to access outside of class time. Study and understand the lecture q's, quizzes, and past exams each day and you will be fine. | Other professors are better at teaching this course. Dr. Kornienko's lectures are hard to follow along, so most of my learning took place outside of class. | Dr Kornienko may be a bit difficult to understand during lectures, but if you go to her office hours and show that you care, she is more than happy to help and explain. The content for this and all other 161 classes are a bit heavy, but again, she is more than willing to help and be open with you if you are open to her. | she has a pretty thick accent and her handwriting is hard to read at times. Office hours are helpful but may not fit with your schedule. She trips over her words a lot and refuses to figure out how to use the microphone. The whole class blows in general and she makes it much worse. | She is very kind and eager to help if you ask. Chem is honestly just super hard but if you do the Elearning practice problems you will do fine on the exams. Her lectures are good for the basics but if you want a good grade you need to practice harder problems. | Sweet & funny but can't teach, her accent was difficult for me to understand even with paying close attention to her words (HEAVY ON exo vs endothermic), goes too slow on the easiest parts of a topic and speedruns through word problems, and i'd end up learning it all outside of class using textbook & langowski's notes and lecture anyway hence the A | Way too overhated, she is very nice and helpful outside of office hours, has clear lectures that cover the basics and provides many practice problems. You definitely need to put in a lot of work outside of class but overall she is good. | Tbh I don't understand these poor reviews. Her accent isn't even that bad & she explains well. Her lecture slides are easy to understand and straightforward. She responds to emails quickly and was available almost every day if we had any questions. Chem itself takes time and practice to understand but she definitely made it easier for me to learn. | You will get a clear understanding of how you should study for the exams, and she is extremely helpful if you ask for extra help. If you are struggling with a topic she will make an effort to help you if you reach out. Overall, if you are trying to get a professor that gets to the point and explains things clearly, I highly recommend Dr. Kornienko! | Prof. Kornienko should be the last professor you should choose if you need to take this course. Not only are her lectures confusing, but it's a bit hard to understand her due to her accent. She's nice, but she cannot teach. | Dr. Kornienko is a great professor that does a great job lecturing. If you followed the rubric for the lab reports, then the lab reports are overall a pretty easy grade. Also, she uploaded previous exams that heavily mimicked the type of questions that are seen on the exams in class. Overall, she is a great and kind professor. | She's a nice lady, but damn. If any other classes of Gen Chem are open please take them. | The review under this must be a fake, because this professor had a video game open on the first day of school, don't recommend her at all. Find someone who will actually teach you the material of the quizzes. | Lot of work, but she gets the job done. Best chemistry professor I've had. Makes things easy to understand, and as long as you have good fundamentals in Chem 161, she builds on those fundamentals in a very clear and obvious way that makes chemistry make sense. Attendance isn't mandatory, but very very highly encouraged. | She had a video game open on the first day of class, what else do you want me to say here? She clearly didn't even prepare to teach for hundreds of student who showed up to class so in return why should one bother attending? She herself even says to go to another professors lectures (Langowski). I hope this gives a clear representation of her. | Not helpful to the course and the department of chemistry should seriously consider visiting her courses to see how unhelpful her lectures are in preparing you for quizzes and exams. Cannot convey material in a beneficial manner to the curriculum and constantly says to refer to another professor, which proves she does not teach professionally. | Chem 161 is a hard course itself and Prof. Kornienko wasn't the best help. Her lectures were pretty organized, but she tends to worry more about how much she teaches in one class over making sure everyone understands before she moves on. The quizzes and exams are also rather difficult, but not impossible. Otherwise, she was very sweet and nice. | She is okay. Gets irritated easily. Her explanations aren't as clear as you'd need for exams so go over notes BEFORE class. She does stick around for Office Hours and is helpful. Supplementing her lectures with someone or something else is a MUST if you want to have a solid understanding of the concepts and strong base for future courses. | Professor Kornienko is one of the better chemistry teachers, considering the chem department at Rutgers is pretty poor. She makes time to answer questions throughout lecture and does a fine job of explaining the material. However, I preferred Langowskis lecture videos for clarity and coverage of the material leading up to exams. | This is the chem department, meaning they are all the same test and quizzes. She is not the greatest of teachers and I have mostly used the textbook to learn. She is very hard to understand due to her accent and can become very mean when students answer questions wrong. If you had to take her it's fine but I wouldn't make it your first choice. | Dr Kornienko is great. Its evident that she really cares for her students and wants them to succeed. Just make sure you do the lab reports and prepare well for her exams and you will pass. | Not amazing, but the best gen chem teacher at Rutgers (which is saying something). It's obvious she loves to teach and cares for her students, which is a rarity in the chem department. Her tests can be a bit confusing, but there's usually a solid amount of points given back. Her office hours were great, and she's always more than willing to help. | Avoid this person at all costs There were spelling mistakes on the exam, and she marked you down if you didnt understand what she was asking from her poorly worded questions. You can tell she has no passion for teaching by her monotone voice. She is condescending if you ask her questions and will sometimes ignore it. | Taking an online lecture as a result of the pandemic, there are a few professors lecturing different sections. Ana was my assigned professor. On the first day of class she automatically expected us to watch the other professors pre recorded lecture and understand the material when her job was to teach us. Do not take her if you want to LEARN. | Yeah... she is not a good option to go with. I stopped attending her lectures because she was going nowhere with them. Please stay away from her in chemistry. The class is terrible with her. | All the chem profs suck tbh. Stopped attending lectures, relied on recitation, and studied on my own. ALSO ""My Organic Chemistry Tutor"" on Youtube was the best. For online environment, rely on e-learning quizzes and practice Qs. But be prepared for any type of question on exams and that the profs are not helpful at all. | She is straight doodoo but if you want an A, do what I did: -do all the practice eLearning Exams (they are similar to graded Weekly exams) -Go to the TI Review Sessions for Exam Reviews - If you are confused on a topic, learn from the textbook (Textbook is actually pretty clear and concise) -Exams are pretty much the eLearning Quizzes except longer | She has a very bad habit of overcomplicating everything and gets herself confused which just throws everyone off. you have to constantly check the assignments or you'll miss out. she stays on a slide for a maximum of 1 minute and expects everyone to understand everything on that slide in that short time. better to drop and get a different teacher. | As a person, she is a sweetheart, but as a professor, she relies too heavily on Dr. Langowski's supplemental lecture videos. Anything he reviews in those videos, she skips over. I would recommend taking Dr. Langowski instead. His lectures are more thorough, Dr. Kornienko is more concerned with getting through more material. | I recommend not taking her if you can. The switch to online really showed how incompetent a lot of professors are and she is no exception. Exams had grammar and spelling mistakes, vague questions, can't take constructive criticism even when she asks her students for it, bad at replying to emails on time, overall, just a bad time. | Prof Kornienko is really sweet. She cares about her students. The final grade you got depended on the amount of work you put in. You are only graded on 3 exams and weekly quizzes. There was no curve at the end but its completely fair because the exams had no restrictions. | You can tell she enjoys chemistry and is willing to answer any questions you have. She has an accent so it might be a little difficult to understand. Sometimes gets confused while teaching, even though she knows her stuff. | Professor Kornienko is an average chemistry professor at Rutgers. While she's definitely not the worst, she's not the best either. Her notes aren't bad but I didn't really understand them and ended up using Tavv's notes this semester. Asides from that, she's caring and understanding of her students so if you have any problems always email her! | Yea she sucks ... not even because her accent because everyone has it and you push through that but mainly because she does not know how to teach. whoever said she's the best is lying, don't believe them because she's the worst actually. | AWFUL. No better way to say it. Consistently makes mistakes in lectures, not to mention struggles with her heavy Russian accent. Better off reading the textbook than studying from lectures for the tests. | Professor Kornienko is one of the best professors at Rutgers. She cares about her students. Her lectures are amazing and she walks you through the problems step by step. Highly recommend her | in the end there was a 3-4 point curve at the end of general chemistry 162.......... | Avoid this professor at all costs, don't let my A fool you. She teaches through slides and doesn't go beyond that all, not even if you ask a question. She is good when you are one on one with her though. If you are stuck with her and hate chem either drop it or get ready to study everyday, thats what I did. | You can do all the practice exams in the world and still fail her exams because she throws in whatever comes to her mind. One of the WORST professors I've ever encountered. She doesn't know how to explain simple topics and overcomplicates everything. She confuses herself and then rather ask students for help. | Horrible. Absolutely horrible. I recommend another professor but if she's you're only option ... run. | She's horrible! she should stay in research and resign as a professor. DO NOT TAKE HER for the sake of your gpa and if you actually want to learn. she's not even a fair professor or nice bc all she does in throw curveballs on exams. chem 2 its not even that bad but she makes it worse. | She doesn't have the same demeanor as teaching in the Summer as she does in the Fall/Spring. I personally don't feel like I got the teaching experience I needed to understand Chemistry 2. It's really all about what you can teach yourself and using the textbook to the best of your abilities + online resources. I prefer Kimmel over her | Professor Kornienko is a very fair professor. She tries to help her students with the lab reports and makes clear connections to other parts of chemistry. Her exams follow a similar format to General Chemistry at Rutgers, with the multiple choice taken directly from the lecture notes. The open-ended, on the other hand, were much more difficult. | The Chem department at Rutgers makes things a lot harder than they have to be. I understand difficultly, but some tests were absurd. That being said, Kornienko isn't the greatest professor, but none of the chem lecturers are great. Accent is tough to understand at times. What you do outside of lecture will determine if you pass or not. | Kornieko is very smart and nice, however, I don't believe teaching is for her. I stopped going to lecture because she makes a lot of mistakes. However, go to her lecture the day before the exam. She goes over things she never taught that's on the exam. She does have a heavy accent but it is manageable. Do A LOT of practice tests to pass. | The chem department at Rutgers as a whole is questionable. The professors are smart, but not the best lecturers. Doesn't matter who you have- you're gonna end up learning the material thru self study. Just wish the lectures were more straight forward. 19 multiple choice questions per exam is not a fair number and doesn't assess our total knowledge. | oh think about a teacher that has no idea how teaching works | She seemed like a nice person but you really needed to go to her just to do well even if you understood everything. She messed up in class a lot and then would claim it wasn't important. Worked very hard for my quizzes and exams but there were still questions that I've never seen before. You really need to work for your grade. Large curves given."
"Drwiega, Thomas","AWESOME!! | Very organized, made learning in the class and looking back to study very easy. | Drwiega was the best. He gave helpful advice during the (online) recitation, which you honestly can kind of relax and take in, as he just gives out two poll questions throughout the Zoom call, which >95% of people get right."
"Kimmel, Paul","Paul Orbe teaches at NJCU for Chem lab. He seems tough and aggressive at first but along the way he's actually really caring and wants you to do well. Don't slack off though, he will only work with you if you're willing to put the work. Overall, take him! He's not bad | He is very nice and understanding when students needed more polls to unlock the quiz. the 55 minutes fly by without even knowing it. I would definitely recommend him. he teaches Thursday 6:55 - 7:50 and 8:25 - 9:20"
"Hijazi, Hussein","If anything, it is a privilege to have Dr. Hanafi for a Core Engineering class. While it may be discouraging (my scenario) at first b/c he tells the truth to you, he never gives up encouraging you to study hard. He may sometimes rush the course contents (mostly at the end), but every lecture is worth attending as Dr. Hanafi is extremely passionate. | dont know the course | FIRST TWO WEEKS LOOK EASY. BUT TOO MUCH HOME WORK, LAP REPORT AND ALSO HARD EXAM. | Teach u basic staff but exam will be impossible. very poor grader. and distribution of course is extremely poor. Try to avoid him | Professor is nice but I would say it is not the best senior design course. This course has nothing to do with previous course and exams are from out of nowhere. Too much class work for such as exams, hws, lab, project, and etc. | This professor helps you until you know the stuff. He wants every students in his class to succeed. Course is a little bit tough and you have to attend every class. There are homeworks in every class, but you will find very helpful."
"Fadeeva, Tatiana","The professor was nice, but her notes were 200 pages per unit, making it difficult to go through all and plus her heavy accent made it even more harder | DO NOT TAKE. Very hard to understand. Handwriting is impossible to read and she teaches wrong information. I made a note on reading the periodic table in class that she had on the slides, and it turned out to be incorrect and the complete opposite. So far I've take 3 chem courses at Rutgers and all were a total joke. Especially Hoove and Fadeeva. | Terrible professor, can't teach and expects you to know everything and reads of slides and just skips around. | So hard to understand. Expects you to know everything going into class. | Really good lectures for chem 2 | Get prepared to teach yourself bc she teaches insanely fast during lecture that it's actually more productive to study on ur own and not attend lecture or attend another prof's lecture. Go to her office hours for help bc shes actually v caring and good at teaching 1on1, just not good in lecture. | the final is awful and can make or break your grade. everything open ended from quizzes to exams. make sure you do your labs and pre labs/post labs/quizzes well to pass the class. | I didn't have her but I still went to her lectures because she is much clearer and gives a lot more practice during her lectures. She goes fast but reinforces what she is taught through examples. I really did enjoy her class. If you put in the effort, you will be fine. The weekly quizzes are insanely hard though. Much harder than recitation/exams. | Professor Fadeeva is very nice and tries to make her students feel comfortable with the content she teaches but she sometimes does a bad job of explaining certain topics, she'll do practice problems and rush onto the next without really explaining what she did. The class itself is difficult so you have to do most of your own studying. | Fadeeva is a good chem professor, but you have to be ready to self-study and do a lot of practice. Her lectures are fine, but her pacing is not the best so she goes thru the slides really fast but other than that you get a lot of review material and if you do them you will get a really easy A or B. Weekly quizzes are kind of annoying but oh well | Fadeeva is a well-rounded professor that teaches and reinforces the concepts well. Curveball questions on exams are rare. Her one flaw is that she goes too fast sometimes. Go to office hours and do the practice exams. Warning: Do not under any circumstance leave lecture early. She will get mad at you. She's pretty nice otherwise. | If a teacher is someone who reads equations/conceptions from a powerpoint, doesn't explain why or what they are, whose handwriting is barely legible and writes their 9's like g's- then Dr. Fadeeva is one hell of a professor. There is no homework, only quizzes & exams. If you're taking this course to learn chemistry, don't take it with this teacher. | I had Fadeeva for Chem 1 and 2. She's nice and funny at times. Her accent isn't that bad. Lectures can move fast, so be prepared to study outside of class, I usually watched Organic Chemistry Tutor or Chad's Prep on YouTube. It's one of the harder classes at Rutgers, but if you understand the material, you'll be fine. The cutoff is pretty generous. | Not horrible but goes so fast, skips steps when solving a problem, and doesn't give much time to solve it. I mostly relied on the textbook and organic chem youtube videos. If you take her, get ready to have her slides somewhere because you will not have time to write notes and do practice worksheets before an exam/ go to review session if you can. | I like her a lot. She goes through material fast so be ready to focus and write as much as you can down while understanding. She's funny and is willing to answer questions. There's problem solving sessions you can attend to help your learning as well as weekly practice worksheets. If you understand the lectures, you'll be fine. | She is a good prof. Lectures are fast, but not mandatory to get a good grade in the class. Do the practice problems religiously and you'll get a good grade. She's always willing to help students, funny at times, and teaches well. Average prof. | First, her accent is definitely understandable and not as bad as people say. Fadeeva was a great professor and always willing to help with office hours and exam reviews. Only downside, she does go pretty fast during the lectures, but I focused more on the textbook and elearning and did well. Recitation in person was helpful for extra practice. | I disliked this class very much. I did textbook readings and exercises, listened to the lectures, did all the practice quizzes, and was still failing. The recitation did not help at all. Lectures were kind of disorganized and she went by material fast. It is really hard to understand her accent. Lots of slides that are hard to keep track of. | In order to do well in the class (and understand what she was saying), I had to read the textbook, take notes from the textbook, and then watch her lectures at 2x speed before the quizzes. This worked for me. She gives all the practice problems you need in her lectures to do well on the quizzes. | I had this professor for orgo lab over the summer during the pandemic (hence why it is virtual). You can tell she is not tech savvy but you can also tell that she truly enjoys chemistry. She explains things well, is always ready for questions and despite everyone in the class having their cameras off, would make jokes and try to be lively. | She's honestly super sweet and genuine. I loved how thoughtful she was: Ex for the weekly quizzes, there was short answers and sometimes I got a q wrong bc I put the wrong num. of sig figs, so she made the midterms all MC bc she didn't want anyone to have that problem. Also she's super relatable and funny and HER ACCENT IS NOT AS BAD AS PPL SAY!! | Took Impact of Chem expecting it to be not TOO bad but Prof Fadeeva made things extremely confusing and difficult. On top of that, there was a quiz almost every class so if you didn't understand that class's lesson, you would fail that quiz. Exams are impossible even if you study. This class was the worst class I've ever taken. | Literally first day of class. I was 2 min late and she's already going through practice questions. I'm not saying that's bad but for those of us who don't learn at the speed of light, this class will be super difficult. She was very strict and will downright criticize you for not knowing an answer to the questions or for asking questions in general | Dr. Fadeeva really tries her best to teach the material, but it is really hard to discern what she is saying because of her thick Russian accent. There was a complete lack of transparency with the grading no one knew their grade until the end. We were told, we curve significantly, but we didnt know where we stood in the class until the end. | This class was just terrible. I think the online format definitely hurt her teaching abilities and I spent most of lectures teaching myself the material. The Rutgers Chem department isn't good in general so I didn't have high hopes for this course. Just try your best and there will probably be a big curve anyway. | Don't take Fadeeva if you have a hard time understanding accents. She also goes way too fast in lecture so you will end up self-teaching. Chem at Rut is also just hard in general. She does hold office hours though which is nice - not great that its right after lecture which ended at 8. Didn't bother to go to lecture cause she can't explain things. | She was pretty good at presenting the material and answering students' questions. There were suggested readings form the textbook that I did, and I am not sure how clear cut the course would have been otherwise. This class had three midterms and a final, as well as ""weekly"" homework. | She has to attempt problems multiple times in lecture to get them right - makes a lot of mistakes during examples, confuses students who aren't already good at chem. Don't take if chem isn't your thing and you need things to be explained to you. Lectures are just examples, no teaching, & she often neglects to include the answers to examples. | Dr. Fadeeva is really sweet. She would bring candy to lecture and office hours. Her lectures are satisfactory, and they have a lot of practice problems that prepare you well for the exam. The exams are straightforward. There is a reasonable curve. If you attend all lectures & pay attention, and do all the practice tests on Sakai, you should get A. | Dr. Fadeeva is def one of the better chem professors I've had. Her notes are very clear and concise. A lot of the examples we do in lecture are like the ones on the exams. Her review sessions are really helpful. She does move fast sometimes. Chem 163 is pretty hard and she makes it doable. Attendance is monitored by checking in online and is graded | Took Chem 2 with her in the summer. Awesome and organized lecturer with a lot of practice exam problems in class and a reasonable curve. Her Powerpoints are a great resource and she is really willing to help her students. | Worst lecturer, heavy thick accent. She makes no sense and is all over the place with her lectures! She makes no sense, examples she says are test related problems but are not. Avoid at all costs | She is a very kind and intelligent professor. She teaches very well and loves chemistry. Professor Fadeeva gives straightforward exams that have basic questions that we went over in class. She is great! | Shes a very nice and intelligent professor. She did lots of practice questions and helped us understand the hard topics in a very humorous and easy manner. Her tests were straightforward and there were no tricks. The exam questions came directly from the classwork. She is one of the kindest, funniest, and intelligent professors I have ever had. | I took Dr. Fadeeva over the summer for Chem 162. She is really not a bad professor. She taught the material using PowerPoint (which is a more organized way to teach the material). She also did a bunch of chem problems as examples for the class the were similar to questions on the exams. She is really accessible and offers help to those who need it. | I took Chem 2 over the summer. Its a rigorous class but Dr. Fadeeva does a lot of practice problems that help w the exam. Her exams are comparable to other chemistry profs. She is helpful if you have questions. She also is reasonable with the curve. Overall: a decent lecturer, smart chemist, and nice person."
"Manjikian, Raffi","Teaching content for management accounting was absolutely useless. Very poor teaching ability, or focus on the skills to learn. No connection between the teaching content and the assignments, as the content was just definitions copied from a textbook. Look elsewhere for classes. Not recommended! | He's a very good guy and accessible in office hours, I am just not sure he is the best person at being able to teach students accounting. Lectures were very dry and long, and participation grades (15% of the final grade) were seemingly arbitrary. Great guy, just not the best class. | Lectures are mandatory and useless, I had to teach myself everything. Content was taught basically everything at once. | Worst Prof I have ever encountered at Ross. Going to his class was a waste of time. Exams poorly written and graded inconsistently. Disgraced that I paid 5k to take this class. Avoid any class with Raffi | Terrible Professor. Tests were not graded consistently. Points were subjectively taken off without providing exam keys to explain point allocation. Class discussions were non-value added. They consisted of hypothetical and non value added questions from people trying to get participation points. Avoid this if you value learning and fair gradin | He is very knowledgeable about accounting but has a hard time communicating the why behind accounting methods. There are no objectives and outcomes outlined for each class, and classes are often confusing because he will jump across topics. Overall a great class, but requires a lot of work to keep and stay organized in the class."
"York, Darrin","I struggled with chem but York helped me understand everything. Someone said ""None of the 90 people in the class could answer a single open ended question confidently"" on the final. I was in that class; the final was easy. Badger him during office hours about concepts instead of methodology. People don't do well because they study the wrong way. | Professor York is one of the best professors at RU and will truly go above and beyond to help his students. The amount that he genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do well is something you don't see often. But in order to get an A YOU NEED TO GO TO OFFICE HOURS AND BE ACTIVE. Show that you are trying and an A is not out of reach :) | In my opinion, as someone who did struggle initially with Honors Gen Chem, Dr. York does his best to make sure all students can and do succeed in his course. I did not do well on the first exam but then after going to office hours I was able to raise my grade. He was very willing to help students raise grades with practice and extra credit. | He's a nice guy. However, he's an absolutely horrendous lecturer and bad at explaining. Nothing is taught in lecture; everything must be self-studied. The office hours are also awful and filled with tangents. The ""active learning recitations"" are not at all conducive to learning. Never take this class. Regular Chem is so easy compared to this. | Terrible professor. Read the textbook and outlined it, did all the practice problems, watched YouTube videos, and even more. Still didn't help. Never take this class. | You know this class is flawed when you get a better grade at the Honors Gen Chem class at Princeton University versus this class. Do not take this course or this Professor. No passion at all and lacks teaching abilities. Exams are not even chemistry, but more logic and analysis based which is atypical for gen Chem. | DO NOT TAKE CHEM163. the class organization is incredibly messy and flawed. Homework is not handed back or given the answers to. Lectures are often go on tangents making them confusing. A lot of TA's and TI's but I guess it quantity over quality as most of them were not helpful. I read the textbook and beyond and all that still just got me a B. | That one TA who is the Indian lady is a much better teacher than the professor. Im sorry but the professor, his teaching style is just all over the place and confusing . I give all my thanks to that one TA, you are the only reason why I am getting a hold of the material. | He goes on too many tangents and his office hours arent too much of a help either as he continues to go on tangents and add excess info making me even more confused. I dont know how he taught general chem 1 and 2 that made him good and understandable but for honors chem I must be really stupid or something since Im just lost at his lectures. | Professor York is by far one of the most caring professors at Rutgers. He wants his students to succeed and provides resources in order to get an A. Although his teaching style may seem a bit dry, hes nonetheless very smart and knows Chemistry really well. You still need to do a lot of self studying though. If you have the option, take him! | If you have NOT taken chemistry for junior/senior year in high school and/or chemistry is not your forte, DO NOT TAKE HONORS GEN CHEM 1. Professor York is a nice but his teaching style and exams for honors chemistry is not suited for non-chem people. It is fast, abstract and Im only getting by because of my parents help who are PhD chemists | Taking him for Honors Gen Chem currently. He's VERY caring and will tell you what you need to do in order to get an A. However, it's up to you to put in the work. His exams are short, but combine a bunch of topics. | Even tho he was rated ""NJ Professor of the Year"" I didn't think he was the best lecturer. He talks very slowly and drones on and on during the 80 minute lecture I had of his. I ended up attending lecture only once a week, but not learning much. Overall, I did fairly well in the class wo his lecture notes. Better off on your own or another prof! | Great professor! Very enthusiastic and interesting. Hold extra office hours before exams for extra help. He also posts all of his powerpoints which are really helpful. I really enjoyed his class. Worth going to lecture. | great teacher, enthusiastic, wants students to do well. he turned the chem department around hes the best! | He is a really nice guy who is very eager to help his students, but he is not the best lecturer in my opinion. He can be confusing at sometimes and often spends time talking about irrelevant things. I stopped going to lecture eventually and still did well in the class. Easiness is irrelevant since everything is departmental. | I was so relieved to find out that he was going to be my Professor for chemistry instead of Professor Siegel. From talking with him, he seems to be a very reasonable Professor and truly wants you to learn chemistry. Sometimes he goes a little slow, but when it comes to chemistry slow is ALWAYS better than fast. Definitely recommend this professor!"
"Sethi, Kiranjot","sethi is a pookie pie! shes a funny gal and if you have specific questions shes quite helpful but lectures were tough and exams were horrid but again its also orgo the worst class ever | Professor Sethi is a great professor. She explains topics well and gives lots of practice problems which are similar to exams. Make sure to keep up with the chapters redo the practice problems, go to TI sessions and office hours. I recommend going to class and recording lectures to look back on. Overall, really recommend taking her for orgo. | Professor Sethi was excellent for Orgo 2, slides were very detailed and outlined exactly what you need to know for the exams! Her lectures were engaging and very helpful, although she did move quickly at times she did a great job explaining most concepts. She also gave plenty of practice questions before lecture and on her slides. Would recommend! | Oh Kiranjot, Kiranjot, Kiranjot. What a professor, She is like mother, go to office hours and she will love you. The class is impeccably hard and you will fail unless you are a try-hard. Use old practice exams to study, group study sessions, and ALWAYS BE AHEAD OF THE SYLLABUS. NO OTHER WAY TO PASS! | Great teacher that clearly cares about her students. Shes a good lecturer but she really excels during recitation. I saw a lot of people complaining about her summer class which I don't understand. A semesters worth of Organic Chemistry II (a course known to be rough) compressed into 1 month is going to be extremely difficult. | Her slides are the best among the orgo professors: straight, clear, and to the point, telling you exactly what you need to know for exams. She may go fast during lectures, but her style of teaching is so incredibly efficient. Gives a lot of practice problems. Incredible experience. There will never be another orgo professor as efficient as Sethi. | Sethi is one of the best professors in the chem department. Orgo is hard and demanding, but she puts so much effort in and truly tries her hardest to attend to every single student in a 500-person lecture hall. She gives a lot of good resources in lectures, so I highly recommend not skipping, as those problems tend to pop up on exams. | I took Dr. Sethi's class during the summer. Was definitely challenging. While she was difficult to hear at times, and her handwriting was terrible, I do think she actually does try to teach her students. But sometimes it felt like she was just trying to show the class how much she knows about chemistry instead of teaching. Take her if you have to. | Took her over the summer for chem162. Her lectures are awful. She just reads the slides and expects you to know everything. She doesn't explain things well, has terrible handwriting, and makes lecture attendance mandatory despite being a terrible lecturer. If you take her expect to teach yourself everything because her lectures are useless. | Absolutely avoid her at all costs, even told her I had a doctor's note and she said ""I don't care about the doctor's note you were not here and therefore no attendance points for you."" Also, her slides are unorganized and always tells students ""you should know this from 161."" Like girl just actually teach and not just throw a bunch of notes at us. | I suggest you take this course with someone else or you'll be ripping out your hair every minute | Doesn't care about her students, insane amount of notes thrown at you especially when its a summer course, there should be a better professor who actually makes a difference in order for students to succeed | Worst chem professor of all time, expects you to know everything when all the notes that's being gone over is new, messy and unorganized, tough to understand, needs to be reevaluated | Sethi is the best. She actually cares about the students and advocates for them. She makes orgo fun and easy to understand. Sethi's recitation and her try problems are gold. Try your best to take Sethi. It is easy to fall behind so make sure you review orgo at least once a week. | Difficult class if you fall behind. Go to lecture, take notes, and re-do all the practice questions, self assessment's, and recitation questions and you will do well. Professor Sethi really does her best in preparing students. | Professor Sethi was amazing as she gives warmup questions each lecture and try problems on her slides that mimic exam-like questions. As long as you do the recommended textbook questions per chapter, do all try problems, recitation problems, warmups, and self assessments you will do fine on the exams | I personally found 308 more challenging than 307. Organic chemistry is a hard course but professor sethi tries her best to prepare you for the exams. She is kind,caring and truly cares about your individual success in the course | Organic chemistry is a hard course but professor sethi tries her best to prepare you for the exams. She is kind,caring and truly cares about your individual success in the course | This class is not as difficult as people make it sound, unless you fall behind. Go to lecture, and even if you don't understand anything just follow along with what prof sethi does on the board. Writing out the mechanisms really helps. She also will literally tell you what will, and will not be on the exam. Her office hours were also great | Orgo at Rutgers is fair. Exam questions reflect practice and homework problems. Sethi incorporates try problems on her slides which are very helpful. I did not always understand Sethi's lecture, but I would say still go because she emphasizes important topics to know for the exam. Also Sethi's recitation is amazing if you cannot go to office hours. | Great professor! Super helpful lectures that are key to succeeding on the exams. Do try problems, self assessments, and textbook problems and youll do great. Also review material BEFORE class and especially after class as well because she moves fast and expects you to have already reviewed. She wants everyone to do well and offers office hours too | My real professor was Chad's Prep | She is amazing professor who takes the time to accurately explain every single topic. Although her lectures can be a little confusing, she is always open to questions about material covered in class and provides ample material to help students succeed. The class is extremely difficult but she is the kind of professor that wants to help you pass. | LIVE LAUGH LOVE SETHI SHE IS LITERALLY SO MOTHER I WISH I COULD RETAKE ORGO JUST TO SEE HER EVERYDAY | Chem 2 is a tough class. You will have to work very hard to get a good grade. Review the notes, ask questions during office hours, and do practice problems. The best thing to do is understand the material. Her handwriting is aweful and during summer she takes attendance for lectures through quizzes. 5HW, 3Quizzes, 2 Exams, 1 Final. Ask questions! | her try problems are gold!!! Very similar to test. Best chem teacher in the department!!! She teachers orgo very nicely. Better than zhang | Awful, literally inconsiderate and rude. She insults you and is very judgemental. | Best orgo prof in department. Clear she cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Encourages students will low self esteem. Goes fast in lec but go to her office hours, she slows things down and pinpoints specifics. Only downfall is bad TAs for recitation and very disorganized. No annotated notes posted outside of class so don't skip! | She's great, wished I didn't have her for 8:30am, Recitation questions and self assessment questions on canvas are on exams, office hours are very helpful. only reason why it's a 5 on difficulty is because its ORGO, don't take it lightly. Study, work hard, study. Exams barely had any trick questions,if a question had too many wrong, it gets removed | super slept on, take her over izgu 100%, love my girl! | Sethi is the best orgo proffesor, but the class is really hard no matter what. She wants students to succeed. One thing I found confusing was that unless you go to class, there are things in the notes you don't need for any exams and also some parts of the textbook the professors don't agree with (?). | Organic chemistry is very hard, but Sethi will make your life as easy as possible. She is always open to help students, and her practice, self assessment, and recitation questions reflect what will be tested. As long as you put in the effort and work with her consistently, you should be set. | She acts like she cares about her students but she really doesn't. She would say we work hard but then complain how shit we did on the exams. The class is only based off the 3 exams and the final which is AWFUL. | She is aggressive and unkind when she supports her students. Yes her notes are helpful, but she does not respect you as a student and picked up phone calls during exams she proctored. Honestly, I would not want her as a professor again.. | Orgo is hard without a doubt, but it's not impossible. Sethi cares a lot about her students and while her lectures may have seemed rushed, you'll find that with any ogo prof at RU. Her office hours are the reason why I would rate her so high; they helped so much in understanding the material and problems. Just pray and work hard, you'll do fine! | she pretends to care but actually she is an evil lady. | Professor Sethi was very knowledgeable as far as the organic chemistry material goes. However, her notes were extremely disorganized and she moves very quickly through the material. Rather than making an organized sheet with questions and answers, she made us take pictures of messy handwritten practice problems that she made up at the end of class. | Professor Sethi is THE BEST professor to take for organic chem. Although attendance isn't mandatory, it would be beneficial for upcoming students to attend them (especially when it comes to orgo 2). Lastly, her practice problems are VERY similar to the questions on the exams, so it would be beneficial to have them as a reference for study material. | Her notes were pretty good but it was hard to understand what was going on during lecture because of how fast and disorganized she was. However she was encouraging and provided us with a lot of examples and extra practice which I liked. She's very average so your grade mostly depends on how much work you do outside of lecture. | It's Orgo, it's going to be rough no matter who you take. According to basically everyone at the rut, Sethi is the best orgo prof, which I do agree with, BUT her accent, disorganization, and a few smaller issues you'll note in lectures (online) + BAD TA's for recitation made me stop caring ab the course and just teach it to myself via the textbook | Really unorganized lectures, but she is nice and means well. The better of the two orgo professors. | you have to go to office hours to understand the material. | So difficult :( Never responds to emails and expects the students to know material. She gives most of the information during office hours. Need to read the textbook to understand the material. | Prof Sethi is one of the worst profs I've ever had. She is completely unresponsive and not accessible outside of class, never once responded to a single email i sent her. She rushes through notes without giving time for students to comprehend and when asked questions often responds with ""all students should already know this"" | Probably made orgo as easy as it could possibly be. Lectures were a bit unorganized but you could tell she cared about her students and would answer any questions you had. One issue was that there were no quizzes or homework, so grade was entirely based on midterms and final. Needless to say that made the grades much lower than usual. | She explains everything so well, and she answered even ""silly"" questions during zoom lectures. I went to office hours and she was so nice. She really cares about her students. I took it during summer so it was challenging to learn everything in a short time. Grade is based on exams and quizzes, homework is optional. | She is the best organic chemistry professor ever. If you have the chance to take her do it. Put in the work and study but she will help you get there. Such good notes and lectures. Her recitations are helpful and she gives many examples and goes over material again if you have questions. You can tell she really wants her students to do well! | Professor Sethi is a very pleasant person and a great teacher. Offers non-graded weekly assessments that prepare you for exams. Weekly graded quizzes that help boost your grade, rather than the typical test-heavy structure. Teaches organic chemistry well and is happy to answer your questions during office hours. Would take again. | If you have to take orgo at RU then take it with Sethi. She makes sure her students understand the material as orgo is quite challenging. She's great at explaining and makes sure her students are treated fairly during the finals as all profs contribute towards making the final. Love her. An absolute gem. | I love her. Best orgo prof at the Rut. If you study and attend office hours you will do well but you have to study (tough course; lots of material). Explains everything thoroughly and answers all questions. Takes time getting used to but once you do you'll succeed. Just gotta put in the effort."
"Shankar, Nirmala","Honestly amazing. I was so terrified of taking chem 2 but she was great. Her lectures were really easy to understand. She broke down the hard concepts and the tough math parts as much as possible. Her lecture questions were quite Easy, but the exams were very hard. Just Attend lecture, go to office hours, practice and youll do well. | Professor Shankar was a great teacher for Chem 162, especially during an online summer session. She kept me motivated to do well, even when I wasn't sure how well I was going to be able to learn the new information. Thorough teacher, gives tons of example problems, and holds regular office hours. | took chem162 this summer (online b/c of the pandemic) & Shankar is an ANGEL to the chem department! She is so encouraging, caring, and inspiring. Also very accessible outside of class with answering questions & overall GREAT at teaching the material in a concise way. Chem @ rutgers is tough so stay on top of studying the material and practice it!!! | Had her for Chem 161 & 162. Go to her lectures & office hours. Do the drills, study them well. For me I felt the textbook clarified certain concepts & allowed me to practice extra problems but I know students who passed without the textbook. Practice, practice, practice and familiarize yourself w/ problems/concepts & you will exceed passing. | Truly an amazing professor. More specifically one of the few professors in the chem department who genuinely want you to pass. She cares about her students; if you take the time to reach out to her and put in the work she will do her best to help you succeed. Also gives extra credit, she really just wants you to do well AND come out knowing chem | She's really helpful and answers questions. She explains topics better than other professors at Rutgers, especially chemistry math problems. She gave extra credit at the end. The only thing is, the quiz and exam problems were much harder than what was covered in class. | Had her for summer session chem I. Was honestly surprised at how much effort she put into making sure everyone understood, even the kids who would ask stupid questions. As long as you paid attention and did her drill sheets, the tests were very doable. Absolutely no complaints she does a great job considering the class was online. | I have her summer chem 161. goes super fast, does not really explain stuff well, kinda just shows you how to do something then moves on. you have to learn everything yourself basically. no extra credit, does not allow you to go back and forth on online quizzes. just made this class super difficult for no reason, especially with exams and quizzes. | SHE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR!!!! I dont understand any other professor in rutgers than her. i took her for the summer session and she is an amazing teacher and she helps you with literally any question you have! She gives a few extra credits and her tests are fairly easy! Pay attention in class and work hard! WOULD TAKE HER AGAIN AND AGAIN!! | Professor Shankar is a good professor. I took her for summer chem161 so it was pretty fast. She gave a lot of extra credit opporutinites which were very helpful. Make sure you do all the extra credit assignments, drill sheets and practice from the slideshow to do well. Practice a lot and you will be fine and the the quizzes seriously. | Dr. Shankar was an okay professor. It was hard to understand her english but was not that bad when you get used to it. Class was extremely difficult and her recitations helped only a little. After taking this course I still feel like I did not learn as much material as I could have. Recommend taking a different professor if possible. | Took Chem II with her in the summer and she was a big help in me doing well. Obviously her summer class moves quickly so going to lecture to and recitation is important to staying on top of things. Her drill sheets are also a great study tool. Otherwise she gives a good amount of extra credit and will do her best to see you succeed. | Professor Shankar is really great. I failed chem in the fall and I retook it in the summer with her. She makes the class so easy. She gives you hints for the exam, and if you do the drill questions you will definitely get an A. The exam questions come from the drills and the lecture questions. She also gives you tons of extra credit!! | Dr. Nirmala is the best thing that has happened to Rutgers Chem Department. She was my recitation instructor for Extended Chem 1 and 2- and was the only reason why I made it through. She has office hours any time, gives amazing hints and tricks to remember concepts, and truly cares as much as you do. Go to her and she'll help you with anything. | Dr. Nirmala is incredible. Take advantage of her intelligence and accessibility. If you let her help you, she will but you have to make the effort. She goes over problems specifically that will help you on quizzes and exams. Listen to her hints and write them down. If she's going too fast, let her know. She is so kind and helpful (also funny) | I had her as a recitation teacher for extended Gen chem 2 and she was hands down the best teacher I've had at Rutgers. She got straight to the point, she knew exactly when you would make a mistake and help you fix it. Without her I wouldn't have got an A in chem 2 | Very helpful with extra help | Had her as a recitation teacher for Extended Chemistry and she was horrible. She treated the students like they were stupid and if you asked her a question she scoffs because she just expects you to know it. She writes formulas wrong for the quizzes. However if you pay attention during recitation the quizzes aren't that hard. | Don't take Chemistry with her over the summer. She covers the material superficially without really explaining and making sure students understand what they're doing. She also makes a lot of mistakes, which can throw some people off more than others. If you're not already comfortable with this subject, she won't do much to make it easier. | The exams are very tough. You can do packets of problems repeatedly and still get numerous curveballs thrown at you on the exam. Do not take chem 2 with Professor Shankar over the summer, you will regret it. | Chem 161 isn't impossible with Shankar but she does make it more difficult than it should be. Her slides are terrible, although they do cover all the material on the exams they don't actually explain the material at all. She decent at lecturing and explaining her slides but she doesn't emphasize enough what material is most important. | This class is hard , but it's a requirement so if must take it, take it with Shankar. She is very quick to respond to emails about last minute homework problems/test prep and will work with you if you ask for help. The class material is clearly presented but do the homework or it gets difficult very fast. There was a good curve at the end too. | Orgo is a tough subject in itself, especially with a large lecture class. Shankar is not a very friendly professor if you need extra help. She also made many mistakes and was not very clear in her grading. Was not a fan of her teaching style. | Not the easiest course (it's orgo!), her exams were fair and there was definitely a curve at the end. She's great about responding to emails with questions, lecture slides are all powerpoint and really clear (unlike Professor Hoves' handwritten mess), and she's nice. Accent didn't get in the way much . If you have a choice, take orgo with her."
"Vitarelli, Michael","the lab is entirely taught by TAs, i had Joon and he did a great job helping with the experiments, explaining, and even demonstrating the labs. some labs were online and were taught using Vitarelli's videos. each lab consisted of pre-lab questions, a chemical hazards form, the experiment, and a post-lab questions. | Entirely taught by TAs. I am rating my TA Dani Slomko who did a fantastic job demonstrating labs and made them easy. Sometimes a tough grader but overall I found this course to be an easy A. It was sometimes a lot of work for a 1 credit class though. Make sure to do pre/postlabs before lab since you are able to leave early. Labs took max 1 hour! | The class is entirely taught by TAs. Your section will have one TA that does all the grading and ""teaching."" There is no interaction with Vitarelli besides the lab videos he posts for the virtual labs. Labs never took the full 3 hours and were pretty straightforward - having a good TA helps. | For chem lab, you have to buy Vitarelli's lab manual and half of our labs were online and then it became in person. Online labs were super easy to get a good grade on, and in person labs were pretty easy too, never took the full 3 hours. only one credit, and was structured good. We did not have much interaction with Vitar., but TA'S were good. | I took Chem 171 while it was online. Vitarelli sometimes made virtual labs to do, but usually he would send us videos made by TA's. I never really had any interaction with the professor. The class was kind of an easy A, but the weekly lab assignments were annoying. | I didn't personally have Vitarelli since the course is run by TA's but he was very nice and approachable through email during the pandemic. If I had a question that was not addressed by my TA, I asked him and he replied quickly without any hesitation. I appreciate him a lot. | It is a course run by TA's and the few encounter we have had with him make it seem as if he believes he is above teaching. | Taught by TAs. Extremely straight forward --- look up the pre lab answers online to ensure you get a 100 and also do the post labs before the lab so you can leave early. The final is easy just do the practice exam and study a little. the only way to do bad in this lab is to literally be the laziest person, which is your own fault then. | TAs will teach 171, not him. The TA who taught my section (Guoyu Zhang) was fantastic. Make sure to do pre labs and post labs before class so you can get out quickly. Study from the pre labs when reviewing for the final | easy A. go to review sections before exams and hand in your reports on time; you're set for a B or better. he makes things easy. this class is also to enjoy chem a bit and boost your confidence after being harassed and disgusted by Hall. wish Vitarelli taught instrumebtal too. labs take 40 minutes max, and reports take 3-5 hours. | Vitarelli is not the person who is teaching you; that's your TA's job. Make sure to do your post labs before coming into class so you can leave asap. Must show up to all classes bc if not that's a whole zero on a prelab, postlab, and chem haz form which is a lot of points. Tbh a LOT of work for a 1 credit class! Took it bc requirement for major. | I honestly don't know why this guy gets all the credit. The one that does everything is my lab TA. She is the one helping us, grading everything, and is the one present during lab. Haven't even met, let alone seen, Dr. V at all this semester. | Go to class, pay attention to what he says, and do the lab reports on time. He gives out a lot of exam questions between lecture, the exam review, and questions from the lab reports. Labs were annoying to complete, but just put in the time. | Intro to experimentation is an easy A class, but it is a bit tedious for a 1 credit class and the class depends on your TA. Some TAs are lenient and dont take the full points off for sig figs and the final is only 12 questions and not bad at all. Just do the pre and post labs at home so you can do the lab in class and leave early. Dr V is nice 2! | Great teacher. Explains and teaches very clearly. Cute in an adorable/nerdy way. | He makes good notes and explains well in class. But he is a pretty harsh grader. Majority of time he's pretty chill but he's outrageous sometimes | He is a very good professor. & He is also cheesy and a very nice person. Attend every lecture because he emphasizes the things that are on the exam... Definitely attend his review sessions because it's very helpful. | He's a really funny guy if you get to know him. Very helpful. One of the best chem lecturers. Def. recommended. | Professor Vitarelli is an amazing teacher. He actually cares that you understand the material and will do everything in his power to help you understand . He's so cute and he makes you promise that you're ""happy"" and that you ""believe"" him when he teaches. He's very amiable and explains things clearly. I would take him again. | Professor Vitarelli is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He is so helpful during lecture by explaining questions students have. I almost always go to his office hours and he really takes time to help each student who has questions and explains any questions I have in depth. He's very nerdy but so cute. He's honestly the best! | Professor Vitarelli is awesome. He is easygoing and narrows everything down. One of his best traits is that he keeps the class balance by explaining the problems in detailed yet easy method so everyone is on the same page. Highly recommended. | The best TA ever!! very helpful and explains everything completely until you understand it. There is a quiz in each class which makes attendance mandatory but it honestly helps to understand the subject and good preparation for exam. TAKE HIM!! | Such a helpful TA! Definitely go to his office hours. He clears up everything and is very nice. | Very clear when explaining material. Goes over good examples. He is very helpful, however, his handwriting is rather poor. | He was my TA for chem 161. He dumbs down everything so much its like hes talking to children. he prances around the classroom to get around and pass papers out and whatever. A complete child-We had a blackout and not only did he force everyone to stay, he started yelling and threatening to fail us when we got excited because of it. Needs to man up. | Great TA, very helpful. Great review sessions, Petrone is a ****.. | Easyness gets a 4 because Mike tries but the material itself is difficult. Helpfulness gets a 5 because he does all he can to get you to pass. Clarity gets a 4 because he needs to improve his handwriting. Otherwise, AWESOME. I wish he did Chem II. | Mike is the best TA! He really helped me to stop doing so bad on my exams and was cool in office hours. I hope I have him again - he was really nice to look at. | Best TA for Chem 159. Very clear and he knows his stuff. He likes running shoes and gym shorts. | Michael Vitarelli time! helped me pass chem... very good at explanations. Very helpful. Michael Vitarelli with a baseball bat."
"Patel, Shivani","professor patel is genuinely a great professor. she uploads the lecture notes onto canvas and her office hours are extremely helpful. however, her exams are somewhat challenging as she wants you to actually learn and understand the material so that you are better prepared for future math courses. i would recommend her to anyone taking calc. | Just don't take her. Look for a professor that can actually teach rather than the professor that fills up your schedule perfectly. She's not worth the grade you'll get. | Never take her class, its terrible | She goes over lecture really fast and it didn't really give my brain time to process. There's like 3-6 assignments a week and they kinda help with the work and quiz that's in recitation. Currently retaking with another prof to get a better grade bc i couldn't go to second part. Also if you see a mistake in your exam TELL HER. | AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. I literally saw the class getting smaller each week due to multiple people dropping everyday. | Great professor! Really cares about her students. In class quizzes at the end of semester. Tough grader but drops 5 lowest quiz & HW grades. Recitation quiz weekly (5 questions) HW is very easy. Study, do the work, & show up for class, no reason you won't succeed. All notes posted on canvas & makes sure you understand the material. 100% recommend. | I loved that this professor posted the lecture notes on Canvas for every class. | literally these people are so overdramatic. this was the only professor ive ever had that gave SO many resources to help the students. she actually teaches the class and makes sure people are understanding. given, there are a lot of cengage hw assignments but they are literally worth 1% of your grade so you dont have to do them?? just go to class. | Great professor, went through every problem super carefully and made things easy to understand. I've never been good at math but I finally understood math because of this class. It is really important to study outside of class and she gives lots of homework and like a quiz every week but as long as you try even a little bit you'll be fine. | make sure you know everything before you come to class. SHE DOES NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING! | BAD PROFESSOR!!!!!!! | drop or withdrawal this class AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN! | The worst professor I've met in my whole life! DON'T CHOOSE HER AS YOUR PROFESSOR!!!! | Every class or recitation there is a quiz! Homework hidden in Cengage. Horrible Professor. | Gave 3 question quizzes every week and gave about 3 homework assignments as well. Each quiz went over a different unit. There is no partial grading, there is no extra credit, and your work must be done in a specific way for her to mark correct. Furthermore, the lectures are very fast paces and have little substance. Zoom-only office hours. | Patel is a horrible professor. She does not teach, she goes through problems extremely quickly without any explanation as to why. Everything I learned throughout the semester came purely from watching youtube videos on how to do the problems she was ""teaching"". She also gets corrected for her answers being completely wrong at least 3 times a class. | Avoid | If you show up to her office hours and make attempts to reach out to her I feel like she becomes more willing to help you out (I also took 111 with her). ATTENDANCE MATTERS, can lose points toward your grade, and homework and quizzes are multiple. Does require you to be flexible with your learning style and doing any practice she gives helps. | Do not take this class if you struggle with testing. The entire class is graded on test taking ability and lectures are extremely anxiety provoking. There is no extra credit opportunity and professor does not respect mental health issues. | Just don't take her. Poor communication, rude to students and does not care if you do well or not. Imposes strange rules and has a strict ""no make up"" policy no matter the circumstances. Trust me. You are better off without her. I would give a zero if I could. | good professor, she wants you to succeed. The material is challenging and she goes VERY fast, but if you tell her to slow down she does, she doesn't mean to teach so fast. Do all review sheets and her hardest questions, and exams will feel easier. Attendance very mandatory. | Prof. Patel is a great professor for those looking to obtain a good foundation for the fundamental materials used in higher level math courses. Her course definitely requires work outside of class so practice. | Definitely a class you have to put effort in, don't expect to never show up and pass - nothing to do w the Prof tho thats just Precalc2. If you want to do well though take Patel because the lectures cover the material so well. She does everything to set you up for success so tbh if you do bad its only your own fault. | I have honestly never had a worse math professor/teacher than this woman. She is horrible at teaching math, I have a pretty strong background in math and struggled to understand her teaching methods. I stopped going to lectures even though she grades attendance because it was easier to teach myself rather than listen to her for 80 min. | I usually do not write reviews for professors but she truly did not respect me as a student IMO. She is a very tough grader, and she takes of points for no reason on quizzes. And if you ask why you got points off she is very stern, and makes you feel bad for asking. I wish I had taken this course with someone else, try not to take it with her. | She went very fast and I couldn't understand. It was a struggle to understand all the information. She thinks everyone knows whats happening. Would not recommend taking her | Do not take this Professor. She's nice but her lectures are so hard to understand. 6 homework assignments a week and quizzes almost every class with no review before hand. Quizzes are 3 questions and with no partial credit. The only extra credit all semester is correcting the exam study guide, so we don't even know if our study material is correct. | Quizzes are only 2-3 questions/she does not give partial credit. The study guides from different math courses and tells us numbers of problems instead of making one with all the questions in one doc. She also gives 1 point credit on exams if u point out mistakes on one of her study guides so u never know if it is right or not. Horrible & very judgy | I took her over the summer for Calc 1 and most, if not all the students, were simply just dissatisfied with her lack of understanding the students needs. Students even had to reach out to the course coordinator for her to take action. Took points off for the slightest mistake and was a tough grader. Try to take a different professor if you can. | Professor Patel was one of the best math professors I've had. She explains lessons perfectly and clearly. Go to ALL her classes and attend office hours if you have to. Ask questions and do the homework + textbook questions. She gives you all the tools you need to succeed, and you will, but you have to put in the effort. | DO NOT TAKE PRE-CALC with prof Patel if you don't have a strong backround in math. She was not a horrible teacher but not good either, it seemed like she wanted everyone to pass but she is not good at explaining topics well and sometimes. I had to attempt to teach myself the lessons after the second exam because she wasn't helpful at all. | I was a little worried going into this class after looking at other ratings, but I honestly found Prof. Patel to be a pretty good lecturer. The exams are a difficult and a lot of homework is given, but lots of review is also provided. It seemed that she really wanted us to understand material during lecture and answered questions enthusiastically. | attendance is mandatory , once you get 4 absences your grade drops a letter. significantly harder exams then other professors. she is a good person though, and is understanding as long as your present in class | Mrs. Patel was a great professor. As long as you came to class consistently and went to her office hours she would help you as much as you needed. Math 026 is not a great class because of the curriculum but she makes it better. She makes the test prep a bit difficult but it pays off when you get your exam grades back. | Just do the homework and that quizzes are almost identical. Use the reviews she posts and you'll be good for the exams | She was pretty average. Not great but not too bad. I would definitely take her class again. | Honestly she's not the best, but also not the worst. She gets pretty upset when you ask questions even though she encouraged us to do that, but then also gets upset when we're quiet. Her teaching style isn't bad tho. Pretty straight to the point and uses lots of examples so she can teach diff methods. She wasn't AMAZING, but I would take her again. | Professor Patel is okay, she isn't the most nice or understanding. It personally took a while for me to get used to her teaching style and the online format but after I got used to it I did better in her class. Be prepared for a lot of homework and quizzes. You really need to have a solid understanding of the material to do well in the class. | I dont understand half of these reviews. Sure she was strict but she was encouraging and caring. She wanted students to succeed. I felt super prepared for the final, was a breeze. And this is coming from someone who got Cs on the first two midterms. | Good teacher! She definitely challenges her students, but in a good way. Honestly though if you never took Pre Calc prior to this class, its gonna be extremely difficult. | Never has a professor nearly driven me to drop college entirely. This course was so extremely difficult for all the wrong reasons: overcomplicated methods, a lack of communication with students, and ZERO communication between herself and the recitation officer. Not to mention the weekly quizzes were exponentially more difficult than the homework. | The professor was not even willing to accept her mistakes, not grade fairly, never going to take her class again, really disappointed. | Professor Patel is pretty 50/50 in my opinion. At times she can be very helpful and understanding (even goes as far to give extra credit for assignments). But she can also be a bit tedious when it comes to grading tests and quizzes and prefers he own methods rather than the recitation instructors'. The online lectures seem impossible to learn in. | She's extremely difficult. I went to office hours constantly, and always went to class. I don't know if it was because I had her fully online but there was no way of learning from her teaching style, I had to fully teach myself. You can't ask questions because she'll get mad at you and she'll get mad at you for not asking questions too. Not good. | Dr. Patel's homework is quite easy. The quizzes extremely hard. It feels like an entirely different chapter. She also goes so fast in lectures and gets mad when students ask questions and mad when they don't. Terrible prof. Take anyone else. | I' m not sure how she is in-person, but her online courses are bad. She goes through the course really fast and gets upset when people don't understand or don't follow. She glosses over the steps when she teaches. IMO the recitation prof was a lot better. | Makes very simple things extremely complicated | She is one of the less difficult professors in the math department. She explains concepts in an understandable way but she takes her time on each question so you wouldnt be able to finish on time on an exam if you did her methods. Summer calc class was open notes but super hard. Tried my best but I dont think Ill even end with a C. :( | could have easily got an A in this class but the way she grades exams is very weird. The first exam is a sum up of algebra and some pre calc intro concepts and the second exam plus the final cover more intense topics. She has a way with teaching but is awful when it comes to grading, she abides by her own rules which I find disappointing. | Failed this class freshman year and had to retake it. She was a way better professor than my first. Exams are hard but she gives you practice exams to study off of. Kind of hard tot tell what she is saying sometimes. Quizzes I mostly failed since they are only like 3 questions each. I stopped going to lectures after the midterm."
"Williams, Milton","She is a great professor. On the first day she said if you do all the work you will get an A. I took Black workers in American society btw. The class is not bad, but A LOT OF READING. She makes lectures engaging. There is 1 paper that is easy and 1 final project. She is very funny and includes events of her life during lectures to make it fun. | Always wants the student to succeed in the class and is an easy grader. | She is a kind professor who is passionate about the subject she teaches. She will tell you exactly what you need on your paper for a good grade. There is a decent bit of reading and you have to post on a discussion forum every week but it's a reasonable amount of work. Overall, just don't slack off and you'll get an A. | Such a nice professor that always gave great feedback that would help me get an A on the final papers. She provides all materials for papers so no need to buy books. Theres 2, 5pg papers each w a rough draft, outline, peer reviews and a 2pg paper w none of those needed. Theres also weekly discussion and replies (3 of each). Much work but worth it | Shes really nice and gives you good feedback on your papers and is a fair grader. The class is a lot of work though. Theres forums and papers due at the same time some weeks. You never get a break. Its only 3 papers which isn't bad but the work in the middle of those is worth too much and hard to balance if you're taking other hard classes"
"Patra, Leena",Dr Bharath is an excellent professor! Sincerely cares about her students' understanding of the material. Dr B is willing to explain concepts in an alternative way if it was not understood the first time. She really knows her stuff! The exams can be tough but there are plenty of opportunities to bring up your grade. I would recommend Dr B to anyone
"Chen, Tracy","Her class needs to be audited by Rutgers. She doesn't teach the material. She wastes time talking about meditation and no one knows what she's saying. Hard projects during finals season and penalties if you are absent. Her teaching should be to help students learn, but in the end you learn NOTHING and are subject to whatever grade she feels like. | This class is a guaranteed A if you show up every week and complete all assignments. Professor Chang's teaching style is very different from every class I've ever taken. No electronics, mandatory attendance (on time) but no exams, it's all about interacting and forming connections with other classmates. I made so many great friends this semester. | Do the homework and participate in class and this is an easy A. She wants the best out of everyone and the canvas quizzes I got a 50% but got an A for everything else. Participation is very important as leaders need to show up. Does a lot of yoga and lectures can drag but there is a lot of games | There's a take home quiz almost every week (very easy), no midterm, no final, save all your papers, you'll give it to her at the end of the semester as proof (you get to propose your grade). She is very kind and not like other professors in a good way. Fair warning though, this class will force you to be an extrovert. | Tracy Chang is the most amazing woman I have ever met. You will learn something new about yourself every class. This is by no means a traditional class, but it is worth your time. She teaches you skills you will need, but would never learn otherwise. Her class is so fun! def would take again | Very unique class. She is not a traditional lecturer by any means but she knows her stuff. Very focused on in person activities. Lots of group work. One of the few classes I looked forward to. Would highly recommend. | lol class was something different. we would play games with each other and have many group discussions. interactive class as opposed to ur usual lecture. dr chang is a character and unintentionally funny. will definitely be entertained. if ur class has good people that will be great as well for the environment. dont be so serious. just show up bro | Bruh this class was the best class i ever took. You won't understand whats going on, but its good because this is not rocket science. Just do the worksheets, come to class, and talk in class. An A is achievable. dont know why there are so many bad reviews. She definitely is not ur typical professor who lectures the entire period lol. Enough said. | Negative reviews are from people who don't go to class. Dr. Chang is definitely quirky. No exams. If you do the worksheets that culminate into your leadership portfolio, you will get a good grade. Must attend class tho. VERY interactive with activities like yoga. Only class that you will interact. Met some great people because of this class. | Unclear subjects of teaching, confusing learning process, hard to get good grades | The class felt very... unstructured from week to week. However, at the end of the semester you turn in a portfolio of assignments and argue your case for what grade you should receive. Attendance is very important, as is working as a team in the Reacting to the Past game played in class. So, try not to miss any sessions. | Professor gives little to no instruction on due dates. Majority of grade is based on attendance, I missed 3 classes 2 of which were excused by doctors notes which she disregarded without a care in the world and gave me a D simply on my attendance. She rambles on and on and on about materials which have nothing to do with the course. DO NOT TAKE. | Prof. Chang is not very clear about exactly what she expects from your assignments. It's all very confusing so make sure to ask a bunch of questions. She always answers promptly. I got an A in the class up until I stopped doing my assignments in the last week. Otherwise, very easy. Long group project that lasts the semester. | The class itself was pretty easy but she's really strict with her grading and doesn't give a lot of details on what she's looking for in assignments/projects, so make sure to ask her a lot of questions beforehand. The meditation was cool and it was optional for extra credit but for the class overall, I genuinely don't think I learned anything. | Class lacks any form of structure. Her instructions are terrible and 90% of the time makes no sense to the students. Completely disregarded what she had in her syllabus originally, and just changed things abruptly. Expect not to learn anything in this course, and just waste your precious time. | DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Horrible at communicating deadlines and assignments. I took this class for Leadership in the Workplace, but ended up meditating and doing yoga in her class. Horrible class. These previous reviews really made me think she would be a breeze, but boy were they wrong. | Nobody knows what she is talking about. Always make student confused about her assignment. | I was so excited to take a class with Professor Chang based on the previous reviews. This class was stressful because she failed to communicate most deadlines, and 90% of the time, the class was completely confused. There's no exam, but there's a Kritik assignment due every week, and on top of that, there's feedback and evaluations and two quizzes | Requirements for how our cam needed to be (lighting, nobody near us, not sitting in bed) despite the fact that we're in a pandemic and didn't expect online classes. Calls people out often. Didn't teach us. Meditated all class and she asked us questions trying to be deep but didn't make sense. Assignments had nothing to do with her ""lectures"" | Only class that u learn everyone's names and feel like family. You meditate every day. Weekly hw but all the answers are on quizlet so idk why ppl are complaining. Theres 2 easy projects one alone & one group. Her instuctions can be confusing but shell help you if u ask and the ppl the complained didnt �� Attendance is mandatory but ull wanna go. | You'll either love or hate this class. I personally enjoyed it and respected her unique way of incorporating mindfulness into the course. I learned most of the course material through hw assignments. The class ended up feeling like a family from constant discussions and group work. She can be a bit difficult to communicate with but overall caring! | Doctor Chang is extremely sweet and passionate about what she teaches. The course is broken down into many different percents for grades. This class is extremely easy as long as you show up and do what you have to do via online homework. She is so professional - but don't mistake that for weakness. She is serious about missing work. | take this professor!!! class is super easy and all you really have to do is go. Only downfall is there is a good amount of weekly homework but all the answers are online. | Tracy was awesome! but there were online quizzes and a group presentation which I enjoyed | easy class but attendance is mandatory | I won't lie, you will either love or hate this changs style of teaching. book report presentation and weekly homework. You will be expected to participate the full three hours and no laptops. i find her grading to be very inconsistent. In addition, you will do daily activities every class that put you on the spot. If you are introverted AVOID | Professor Chang's class was my absolute FAVORITE this semester. Classes were low stress and had interesting discussions without the pressure of exams or taking notes. We all learned literally all 35 or so of each others names, and it felt like a family most of the time. Her methods might seem odd at first, but are totally worthwhile. | The easiest class ever. Weekly assignments that take less than an hour total to do. Get on her good side. No exams, 2 very short and easy projects. Show up to class and half of your grade will be taken care of. You can also choose to meditate for 5 minutes a day for 36 days in place of half of your assignments (do this). Chang is so cute and sweet. | The class is pointless the professor makes class and student very uncomfortable, you don't really learn but your grade is for showing up plus thing completely unrelated to class. It should be an easy class but it's easy to fail a LOT of pointless assignments. | Listen up people! This is the easiest class youll ever take if you choose wisely. All of have to do is choose the yoga/untraditional Route. The real course is hard (so Ive heard) but the version I took was the soooo easy. I didnt learn a thing but it sure raised my GPA. | Very odd class, you cannot skip this class she would drop your grade very fast, all you do is yoga/breathing but you are graded on completely different work. Gives 0 feedback so you think you would be doing well because all your doing is yoga but no; you have to participate A LOT talk in front of class several times - I don't suggest this class | I would never recommend this class. One of the worst classes I have taken; you learn little and do several breathing tasks for hours- hard to sit through I would avoid this class at all costs also you cannot miss a class; no technology; teacher makes class uncomfortable | She makes us do yoga in class and never teaches. the class is peer taught. She gives you 2 options and the one that I chose was your entire grade is sending her a text every day that you did your yoga, group presentation to the class on your chapter of the book as well as a paper on that chapter, weekly Pearson quizzes, and attendance | Very strict attendance policy, Professor is very scattered uses the whole 3 hour for class no technology - typically doing breathing excercises for most of class but weekly papers and quiz are not on breathing/yoga. If able I would avoid this class at all cost | Attendance is key in this course. Even though all you do is meditate and watch sadguru videos, DO NOT skip. You will be tempted to skip but missing class will bring your grade down a lot. Aside from that, daily online quizzes on Pearson before class, daily mediation before class and a reflection paper at the end of the semester. Youll love/hate her | Class is scattered - very hard to sit through it is 3 hours & I haven't learned much of anything little to 0 feedback given all semester and in class and what is graded is extremely different | Look into other classes. This professor rarely gives feedback, you do yoga most of the day and are graded on material not taught in class but online videos. 3 hours no technology and teacher can be very rude sometimes nice sometimes. At least for class I took I would never do that again worst Professor I have had | I believe this class should be under review. I with many other students actually dropped the class (so now we have to have a W) Due to the ambuigity of this class, not a clear teacher, spends most time doing breathing excersie (3hours class) and gives 0 feedback & you are graded on context not related to work in class - if you dont have to DONT | Professor Chang gives little feedback and most students learned at end of semester they weren't doing well even though all we did was yoga and other menial things. This classs seems easy then you find out she's giving you a D and will not communicate. If you want to learn or be able to even tolerate your prof. she is not it. also no electronics | One of the worst classes I have ever taken. Teacher typically preaches about having open mind and is very close minded. Spend most of the class doing yoga but graded on unrelated things to class work, not graded for the 3 hour yoga quizzes and test about info she rarely speaks about and you have to text her multiple times a day how you feel | she is a terrible prof. she is a combo of nice, weird, with a touch of snob you get from prof's. But the teaching aspect of things is so far off from the usual prof script. Theres zero direction in her class and you don't know where you stand or even where she stands half the time. Communication is biggest problem, but like i said she is nice. | If you don't like talking in class this isn't the class for you. We were given online programs for all the class work. Attendance was mandatory but you didn't really learn anything in the actual class itself. I would have rather taken an online course. Overall, still an easy class as long as you do the work and show up. | Prof Chang is completely unconventional. She uses this thing called MindLab, which is basically a mandatory 3-minute meditation that you have to do almost every day the entire semester. It had little to do with the actual course material, but I ended up learning a lot about mindfulness, which is awesome! No phones allowed in class. | This class was so odd. She offered a choice at the beginning of the course. Option one was a more normal course, but option two was an online program where you watch 7 videos and meditate etc. then there was 48 days of meditation. It was extremely easy but so strange. | Prof Chang is so sweet and caring. She gives ample extra credit opportunities. Be aware that participation is crucial in this class and so is attendance. She assigns work in an outside website but the actual work we do in class is very unique and is more about personal growth and using that in an organizational sense. Overall, she's great!! | great professor but there were just TOO MUCH group activities | This particular class involved a bit more work but her energy makes it a pleasant experience. Only complaint was the unclear assignment criteria. Guests weren't briefed properly on the final pitch. Grades came in very well regardless. | A non-traditional approach at a lecture. Initially I questioned it. Then I learned to appreciate her style as it is very engaging and allows you to network with each and every person in the class. Homework is done online in the form of readings, quizzes, and tests. I'd recommend! | Extremely nice professor and really amazing person, but lets not act like we really learned anything earth shattering. Online quizzes are long, difficult (but doable) and in class you have two group projects which you grade each other on. Follow the class system, get your A, and consider it done. | Professor chang is one of a kind. i didnt like the class because you have to think out of the box, but you'll get use to it. The quizzes are VERY difficult, but everything else makes up for it, for a great grade! i would def. recommend her to everyone, and you meditate in class!"
"Allen, Rachel","Professor Kremen is awesome! Honestly one of the best professors Ive had at Rutgers! Shes super understanding and her class is very enjoyable. | The teacher is amazing. Take her for writing for media the class is interesting and theres 4 papers all together the entire semester. These are 300 word papers that just need to be formatted right. She's caring and helps with any questions. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER. I had such a good grade i needed a 30% on the final to get an A. | I wish she taught all journalism classes. She is dedicated to being the best professor she can be to her students and makes difficult topics easy to understand. Her class consists of small group assignments, 1 video project, and 2 exams. The workload is very manageable and her enthusiasm makes each class fun. She's a gem. | Professor Kremen is amazing. She has a great attitude, keeps class alive, and her assignments are very easy and straight forward. The exams are literally based on the slides, which she posted this semester online. 10/10 take her for ethics you won't regret it. | ethics with kremen online was SO much fun. lectures were recorded, so not mandatory attendance, but she made me WANT to come to class. she is such a lighthearted, sweet, and silly woman, who genuinely wants to make the material enjoyable. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER! | If I could have professor Kremen teach all my classes I would. She would let us out early almost every class. Gives time in class to complete assignments. Replies to emails quickly, and always responds to questions. She is very clear with what she is looking for which makes it easy to get a good grade. Take professor Kremen!! she is the best. | Professor Kremen is the absolute best! I had her for Writing for Media and she's one of the best teachers I've had at Rutgers. Show up to class, follow the rubrics, and you'll definitely get an A or B+. Also ask for feedback because he really helps you grow as a writer. She is very knowledgeable about the field of journalism as well. | Professor Kremen is amazing professor that truly cares about her students' success both within her class and outside. I had her also for JMS205 & she was great then too. The assignments/midterms in her classes are pretty easy & straightforward. She also has no problem giving extensions as long as you ask before the assignment is due. | Professor kremen is THE BEST!! Take her without even thinking. She is so helpful and understanding. She makes the material interesting and easy, she will do everything she can to make it as easy and understandable as possible. Her quizzes aren't that hard. Midterms and finals can be a little tricky tho , but not for who came to class a d studied. | It was a wonderful class. Professor Kremen is an amazing professor who is truly interested in the success of her students. She is very funny and is always there to help. I took media, Ethics, and Law with her and got an A. There are many opportunities to get an A- quizzes, exams, group assignments and presentations. | One of my fav professors ever taken at Rutgers! Took both writing for media and media ethics+law with her. Super fair grader and gave lots of good feedback. Assignments were usually pretty easy, and always gave a good amount of time to get them done. Super nice and funny and just a cool person overall! Definitely try to get into her section!"
"Inamdar, Neelay","Caring and passionate professor that focuses on very heavy lectures. It's recommended that you read textbook chapters in preparation for exams, alongside studying her practice tests heavily. A lot of the class is based around lectures, but she doesn't hesitate to explain something again if it was confusing. | The professor is really kind and understanding. The only thing was how difficult the exams are, but biology, in of itself, is a hard subject, so I don't blame her. Due to the low exam scores, she allowed for take-home exams and the final exam was half open book. Studying is a must for this course. Otherwise, you will not pass. | The course is really hard and the materials are a lil too much, you are going to have to study a lot. She is very nice and understanding about everything. She gives study guides before the tests but even if you study really hard chances are you won't ace the test but the professor usually gives a take home test after so its's not bad. | One of my fav Prof's and is passionate about science. She's always willing to help and will take the effort to use a different method of explaining if you don't understand something. She also draws visuals while lecturing which is so helpful in an info. heavy course. Such a sweet woman, I never dreaded her lectures or stressed out for her class. | She is awesome. I would recommend taking her classes. | Really kind, will gladly go over things if you don't understand. However, her tests are very difficult so pay attention and study a lot. Her tests are mostly fill in the blank and there's no word bank, but she may curve grades for those who don't do well on tests. | She's very nice. So many power points. She doesn't grade tests or grades very late. She will see which kids got highest grade and give them an A. She uses lab time for class lecture which can be annoying if u don't have her for lab. Liked her enough to take her again. | She's an awesome professor makes the course as easy as possible to understand and is very supportive of your needs, she will go out of her way to educate. Everyone should have her as a prof. | Easy A, but you won't learn a damn thing. Funny how that works, right?"
"Patel, Riddhi","He's articulate when giving lectures and explains things in an easily understandable way. If there seems to be something students are struggling with, he goes back to clarify with new examples or from a different angle. He seems to care a lot about students learning. He's very organized. His lectures are recorded, so you can review them later also. | He is super nice and really wants to teach something to his students !!! | It's my only second week with this Professor, but it is so refreshing to see an organized and passionate professor in the Rutgers cs department. This guy has given us tons of resources, including this site called ed, where you can ask questions anonymously, and it's so helpful. Whenever someone asks a question, he makes sure to get them the answer. | Nice guy and really cares about comp arch"
"Pecoraro, Matthew","Barros is fair. If the class isn't ready for a quiz some day, he won't give it. That said, I don't think his in-class explanations are the clearest, but he's always looking to answer questions and re-explain concepts, and he responds to emails very quickly. | Great professor, his class is interesting and straightforward. If you come to class and pay attention then you will definitely pass his midterm and exam. Homework and quizzes are 50% of the grade. Homework is straightforward and does not take excessive amounts of time, and quizzes are pretty rare."
"Sadeghipour, Mitra","By far the worst professor I have had, literally do anything to avoid taking her. | Hands down the worst professor. She heavily grades you on the exams and I have failed them every time. I cant understand her and the power points she sets up don't make sense. She points at the screen and yet has no idea what she's talking about. She jumps from point to point and MAKES NO SENSE. DO NOT TAKE HER | Has no idea what she is doing, reads straight off PowerPoints and doesn't make the exams herself. Her lectures will not set you up for success and the class is heavily graded on exams. TA was the only help in the lab as well. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! | Overall this professor does not teach professionally. She uses the textbook created slideshows and expects students to answer chemistry equations with no expectation of example. Exams are given and don't match up with what she talks about in class. She is a decent lab instructor | Prof. Sadeghipour lectures heavily, jumping around from point to point, which gets confusing. If you do the work in class and lab, you will do fine until exams. I had to drop the class because exams are half of your grade. I wouldn't recommend taking the class with her if you don't already feel confident in chemistry. | Teaches directly off the PPT. Ended up teaching myself with Youtube videos. Worksheets were actually really helpful and reflected quizzes/exams. The way she has us hand in online work is annoying, but everyone has a specific way of doing things I guess. Overall, if you put in the work out of class, then you should be fine taking this professor. | Hard to understand & she just reads off the PowerPoint. You would probably have more luck teaching yourself from the textbook. I was struggling so badly in her class that I had to get a tutor. I will say she pretty much just grades on completion & you can find the step-by-step answers to the problem set question on YouTube. | This professor is the worst professor I have taken in my entire life. General chemistry, for most students, should be a nice easy GPA boost. She does not curve, she does not give study guides that work, she is not available after class, and she does not care about her student's grades whatsoever. AVOID MITRA AT ALL COSTS! | Mitra is not a good Professor. She does not explain her lectures at all. Everything is taken directly from the Chemistry textbook. She points at the screen and pretends to know what is happening. The Problem Sets and exams are nothing like anything ever said. Even her keys have mistakes on them that will confuse you. She doesn't know Chemistry. | If youre going to listen to any review about Mitra, listen to this one. Avoid taking this professor at all costs. If you dont want your GPA to plummet I would advise to keep her off your schedule. Her exam questions are NOTHING like what she teaches in class. Her lectures consist of pointing a laser pointer at a screen and reading off a powerpoint"
"Roth, Heinz","Professor Roth made the tough ORGO material more bearable with humor. The recitations were fantastic for clarifying concepts. I found Unstuckstudy and the free textbook super helpful too. | Fantastic recitation professor! Really made concepts make more sense and ployed humor to make class more bearable. | Better than last sem in 307. I'll say the same thing I said last time: Read the textbook. Orgo 2 is on-par with, or even harder than, orgo 1. Be sure to know how to read NMR spectra, he'll ask about it the entire semester! | He will blame us for failing while his passing averages are in the 30s. Terrible slides, barely understandable and you need to resort to outside sources to be able to pass. And not even pass with an A, more like a C. He doesn't teach problems, just criticizes. Youre teaching yourself. Idk how i passed orgo 1, lets hope god is real. | He CANNOT proofread his exams or practice set problems, leading to more confusion than needed. You're better off making more use of your time by reading the textbook and looking at his notes instead of going to class. Overall, doing his practice set problems and SSAs helped with preparing for exams, and his curves were very generous. | Roth's class was the most disorganized course I have ever taken. His lecture slides can be confusing at times. It was not uncommon to have exam/class information be conveyed unclearly. Answer keys are consistently incorrect. Don't bother with provided material, READ THE TEXTBOOK. He's an alright guy, but be prepared to teach yourself. | HDR is one of the best profs I have taken. Orgo may seem impenetrable & success in ochem is difficult. It will take HOURS out of your week. Roth provides students with everything they need to pass. This is one of those classes where u need to teach yourself. MASTER every problem set, figure out what material is on exams and you will be fine. | I never understood the hate Professor Roth would get. Orgo is a hard subject, but coming from other professors, Roth makes it bearable. His lecture slides are clear and easy to follow, and the exams do not stray far from them. Exams are hard, but he is very forgiving in his grading. Exams get boosted AND the final grade is curved. Super reasonable | Dr. Roth gets an unreasonable amount of hate on here. He's a solid professor. His lectures aren't the best, but the slides are well organized, and every exam question is somehow derived from info found on them. Exams are extremely difficult, but very well curved. Massive grade cutoff changes at the end of the course mean you can pass with a 40. | Dr. Roth was very knowledgable. Coming from professor Jimenez he is amazing. His lectures were much more informative and better organized than hers. Everything on the exam was in the lectures, so understanding all those concepts guarantees you a good grade. The exams are very difficult but he really tries to prepare you for them. | Professor Roth is not nearly as bad as people say he is. It is a challenging class for sure but if you skim the chapter before lecture then you'll be in good shape. He is accessible outside of lectures during office hours or via email. His slides (made available to students) are pretty well put together and helpful for understanding content. | Organic chemistry is a difficult subject, but professor Heinz makes it more bearable. He is always prompt to answer questions, in fact, he encourages them. His way of teaching is very effective IF one reads the book before lecture. His exams tend to be a little more difficult than the exercises, make sure to go to OH and youll be fine. He jokes a | Absolutely not good. | I don't understand the hate Professor Roth gets. He was super helpful and very reasonable in his grading. Exams were curved fairly and the overall class was too. In comparison to Sethi online, his notes were much clearer and easier to follow. Honestly a great professor for a very difficult class. 100% wish I could take again for Orgo 2. | He is horrible at teaching lectures, doesn't explain and doesn't seem to care for his students. I can't believe he is still at rutgers and people let him teach. I had to drop the class before the first exam because it was that bad. I cried each day from not understanding the material and he goes through it super fast. Get ready to teach yourself! | DO NOT TAKE ORGO OFF SEASON! Exam averages in the on season classes is a 56 while exam averages in off season classes (Roth) is a 37! You have been warned. His exams are much harder than the classes on season | Dr. Roth is not the best choice to make for organic chemistry. He is a pretty nice guy, but simply reads off the powerpoint slides in his thick german accent and does not promote student learning. Exam grades continue to be in the 30s and 40s for each exam -- to be frank though, the whole Chemistry department and all its professors are god awful. | I thought he was okay! I didn't mind his lectures and the curve was nice! | Listen to me when I say this all these reviews are 100% correct about this absolute awful dude. Orgo is already a tough subject and taking it with Roth makes it 100x worse. His entire class is grades on 3 exams and 1 final which are all cumulative. Despite the terrible reviews I took his class and regret it everyday. DON'T TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES!! | Even you learn all material from textbook, you still cannot do well on his exam. IT IS REALLY HARD. and the lecture notes is really mess up. I will retake Orgo for summer. | I know Professor Roth has good intentions and he seems like a nice guy. However, he can not teach for his life. Slides are difficult to understand, and our grade is only made up of exams which is awful. Lectures are useless and you will end up teaching yourself. I thought i'd be fine bc i ended up fine teaching myself gen chem but im barely passing | i'm gonna be honest this is my first day of lecture with him but homie went through his entire blood line the first day, didn't discuss the syllabus at all, and went straight into lecture, which pretty much tells me all I need to know. I was warned about taking him but I have no other choice so I guess I'm teaching myself this semester :) | I absolutely hated taking this class with him. It honestly turned into a self-study course. I didn't learn anything from lectures and recitations were kinda helpful. I mainly used the textbook and videos to do well in this class. The exams were crazy hard and the class was solely based on exams. Take it with anyone else. | His lectures were boring & his slides were confusing. He does not know how to use technology. The book did not help because he claimed the book did things wrong. Grades were based off of exams only. His exams were written so poorly that they were mostly a guessing game. His ego was huge and he called students dumb and liars. AVOID IF YOU CAN. | I really tried my hardest to like this professor. This man is the reason why i will be giving up my dream of becoming a doctor. This man did not even care that classes are being taken online. I honestly feel like he made the class 10 times harder online than he would've in person. AVOID HIM AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | This is a challenging course. While not perfect, Dr. Roth is a kind professor who is very knowledgeable about organic chemistry and more than willing to help. Tests are difficult but definitely doable if you dedicate significant time to studying. Office hours are crucial. Just give him a chance and you will learn so much, and maybe even enjoy orgo! | This class was not as bad as I thought it would be as long as you put in the work. Tips: 1. Do not touch the textbook. All of the test questions come from his slides 2. Attending lecture is a waste of time. Spend that time looking over his slides 3. He is definitely not the best at explaining the material, but in office hours he gave good tips | For someone who did well in Orgo 307, good luck taking Orgo 308 with Heinz. His exams are designed around his lecture notes which makes it 10x harder because he does a poor job of lecturing. This class is basically taught on your own with little to no help since there was only 1 TA. His exams and grading scheme was unfair. Save yourself from him. | Roth is not going to spoon feed you anything. This is a course where you will teach yourself or fail, so arm yourself with the solutions to exercises and get to writing your master sheet of reactions with his slides, the book, and material online. Going to lectures was useless to me, he talks slow racing thru concepts so the pacing is very weird. | NEVER TAKE THIS GUY. He made my semester horrible. He called several students blatant liars bc they called him out for unfair grading. If you email him, he will sass you and treat you like you are a criminal. He is literally mean. We had 300 people complaining about him in a town hall. He incorrectly graded exams and would not give back the points | One of the worst teachers I've had at any level. He couldn't figure out how to virtually execute an attendance grade so he removed it altogether. The only grades for this class have been exams for which the class average is consistently below a 50%. Class lectures are meaningless as he just reads off the slides. Save your GPA, take a different prof | Such a terrible professor. It is rly sad that Rutgers decides to have him as a teacher when he clearly doesn't want to teach nor cares about teaching. If you care even a little bit about your sanity or GPA you should AVOID taking his class AT ALL COSTS. Take on season orgo or over the summer: trust me. Ppl stop registering for his class, seriously. | He made me want to kermit. Please save yourself and DONT EVER TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES. He is so condescending and absolutely rude. Again, PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR GPA AND DO NOT EVER TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES. | Nothing good to say. Avoid if you can. This has been the most frustrating class I've ever taken, he is rude, condescending, can't teach and there are SO many inconsistencies with people getting different curves, being favored and between recitation and lecture. Emails not answered, exams formatted wrong + no transparency. | Worst professor I've ever had. This class has made me hate organic chemistry. The amount of frustration I've experienced is insane. There is no transparency. He rarely responds to emails, but when he does, he is extremely rude and condescending. His exam averages are consistently below a 40. He always contradicts the textbook and himself. Terrible. | I had Dr. Taylor for Orgo 1. I loved the class, learned so much and got an A. I then took Roth for Orgo 2 the next semester, despite seeing his ratings. Biggest mistake of my life. Lectures are useless, he skims through his slides (that already are hard to understand). He is very condescending towards students, and exams are impossible. Sad. | just to give perspective, the avg for the 1st exam is lookin like a 30. He reads off slides, doesn't elaborate or teach. very rude to students. took this during covid thinking he would cut some slack- instead made our grades only based on exams, no hw or quizzes. made our exam SOO hard to mitigate cheating & accused us of it even tho avg was a 30 | Lecture slides are disorganized and super wordy & reads straight from them. What's worse is that he looks down on students and provides NO encouragement in understanding orgo. Nobody asks questions because he will make you feel absolutely stupid. By far the worse professor at Rutgers. Tbh I'm surprised he's still allowed to teach. | If there was an option to give him a 0 i would he is just that bad. Literally so terrible very unclear, nasty and mean, thick accent, and does not explain anything. There is absolutely no point to his lectures you are better off seeking TA help or online resources. I don't know who's brilliant idea it was to make him the new off season orgo teacher | His lectures are super hard to sit through and understand. His presentations are impossible to follow. Just read the book and go to Sethis office hours and you should survive. Best thing about him is that hes only there for one exam. | If I could rate him a zero I would. Terrible teaching abilities and very unprofessional when it comes to responding to emails or even putting up resources for students. | terrible at teaching concepts in an understandable way | The notes were incredibly unorganized and directly state the textbook is wrong while the class says to study from the textbook. I have never seen such a horrendous class with a wretched professor. He goes on tangents and never addresses the problems at hand. Even with hours of studying, you still won't pass. Posts homework without answers. | By far worst professor I've ever had. Had to rely on the textbook to learn the material. His slides are so wordy and jumbled that everything is more confusing than it should be. He reads off the slides and talks at 2mph. Cannot understand him. Exam is unfair and has typos. WOULD NEVER TAKE HIM AGAIN. | He's now one of the professors for orgo, so you are unfortunately stuck with him for a third of the semester as he's a horrible professor. He cracks weird jokes, he's horrible at explaining concepts and his incredibly thick accent makes him impossible to understand. His notes are a bunch of nonsense and you'll have better luck reading the textbook. | DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!!WORST ORGO PROF EVER | He should not be called a professor unless the class is called, bad puns 101. He is the recitation instructor for honors orgo, and he is one of the worst instructors I have had. Recitations are absolutely pointless; he just makes stupid jokes throughout the recitation without teaching anything. It is a real shame Rutgers has professors this bad. | He is terrible at lecturing, there is basically no point of going to class except for participation. You have to really look through his PowerPoints to find necessary information. | While Professor Roth is a brilliant man and researcher, his teaching leaves much to be desired. For example, during class he suggested we bang our heads against the wall to understand organic chemistry. His lectures are awful, make no sense, and aren't helpful at all. He seems like a nice guy, but he doesn't make orgo any better. | He is the recitation instructor for Honors Orgo. I can't imagine having him as our actual professor. He is obviously very knowledgeable, but he can't teach. He drones on without ever actually teaching , makes dumb, sexist jokes, and is often condescending. Recitation is a waste of time. Utilize office hours (not his) and other resources."
"Ghosal, Anima","Horrible! Don't take her unless you want to teach yourself. Literally reads the powerpoints word for word exactly, doesn't teach in her own words at all. She also gives hard quizzes every week, which kills your grade if you don't know it. | if youre the kind of student that can learn from a teacher that reads from a power point and only does that, by all means take this professor."
"Kukrek, Ahmet","I took CHM010 (hybrid) during a summer session in which Dr. Kukrek was my instructor. Overall, he was fair and approachable. His lectures are quick, and his main focus is formulas, so make sure you practice in your spare time. Short, timed quizzes online. Straightforward lab quizzes. One final, mandatory in person. It's an easy A. | I took him for labs, I really had a hard time, he doesn't know half of the time what he is teaching, he himself is confused in class. Does not explain the concept at all, just expects you to know and he changed our time for the class, which was hard for me to adjust, but didn't care. | Probably the worse class ever taught by him. He throws formulas at you during labs to solve on your own doesnt explain how to do them or examples and proper steps even when doing labs. Youre all on your own. | Hes a professor that actually cares about his students passing. Pay attention and write good notes youll pass with flying colors. Took him during the summer, surprisingly it was an easy A. This class was the best short period class Ive ever taken. My Psychology and sociology classes required tons of work during last year summer semester. | Dr Kukrek was a real gem, teaches with straightforward visual lessons & powerpoints, friendly, caring, and always patient for any type of questions. You can get by without a textbook just do practice problems from youtube and redoing his slideshow examples. Gpa booster and makes chem easy. No Hw, short, timed quizzes, just study before taking them. | I can't say enough good things about Professor Kukrek. He's such a nice person that cares about his students and wants them to succeed. His class is very straight to the point and he teaches to the test, which I appreciate. As long as you show up and understand lecture, you should do good on quizzes and tests. No need to buy the textbook."
"Warmuth, Ralf","Really sweet guy. Answers emails fairly quickly with a detailed explanation. Explains the topics really well and is always ready to help and go over questions. His extra practice problems are really helpful and help you understand the topics well. | When adverse events hit during the year (i.e. corona virus), he was very flexible and put int he effort to work with the needs of the students to make the class doable. He also is extremely knowledgeable in the subject material, and can clearly answer questions and explain even difficult topics | Dr. Warmuth is perhaps the most amazing professor Ive ever had. He will answer any questions you have with the best of his ability. Orgo is a hard subject at times, but he cares, and you can see it in his teaching. | best of the 3 professors, his notes are really good : short and concise. He goes at a good pace, and his exam doesn't cover a ridiculously large amount of info. straightforward exams. He's 100 times better than Boikess and Roth. Made Orgo seem ""do-able"". | The best lecturer of the 3, and the nicest. Always answers e-mails right away and is very clear with what material is important and what will be tested on. While compared to the other lecturers it's a guessing game which wastes valuable time. He's kind and encouraging and it's unfortunate he only teaches for one month at the end of orgo 2. | For the first time I can say an orgo exam was made fair. Tested us on EXACTLY what he taught. Nothing more nothing less. The avg is going to be high sure, but it felt like I actually learned/knew orgo for once. | He is the man. 2016 exam 3 was very straightforward no funny buisness. | He is a very nice guy and super helpful but his exams are ridiculously tough. Midterms were harder than finals. Overall avoid his class if you can. | He was my favorite professor - much better than boikess. He has a German accent but he's fairly easy to understand. His notes are incredible and that was the best part about his presence. Lecture was whatever, orgo lecture is pretty much useless all together, if you want to succeed go to the TA's office hours. | He's not a good lecturer. He seems to be very intelligent, but he's bad at explaining things. I'd rather have a professor who doesn't know the material quite as well but can explain it so that everyone can understand it. Warmuth seems to forget he's not teaching graduate orgo and that he's teaching orgo to people who have never seen it before. | Helpful but sometimes he is difficult to understand.In the middle of the lecture he gets confused.Tough grade master. | I couldn't understand him at all. Useless lectures. Sure he's a bit better than Boikess, but O'Connor blows them both away. I'd put Warmuth equal to Boikess after seeing O'Connor. | I won't classify him as the best but at this point anything was better than Boikess! | This guy is very helpful. He seems to live by his computer because if you ask him something he will reply within minutes. Very decent lecturer despite accent. He will make time to help someone if needed. Orgo it self is not too easy but he makes it easier than Boikess(aka Roger from American Dad) | Notes are much easier to follow than Boikess's, but it comes at a price: it's hard to understand his voice if you don't listen carefully. Says ""in principle"" too much and refers to tests as ""examens"". Regardless, orgo is still hard and you need to make sure to do the homework. | This guy is at RU to do research and his own experiments,NOT TO TEACH,teaching is just a requirment for him.He could care less how well he teaches or well students learn material.Once again:IF POSSIBLE I HIGHLY RECOMEND TAKING ORGO AT YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE,THE CLASS+THE LAB WILL TRANSFER HERE | Nice guy. His hadnouts (not all of his notes are online) are crystal clear and detailed. Aside from his accent, his lectures are comprehensible, yet inthemselves not very facilitory to teaching concepts behind the material to students. In earnest, does try to help though. | One of the best lecturers in the Chem. Dept. While he can be a little hard to understand at times due to his accent - he is always very thorough and happy to teach. He has the students' best interest in mind and by far the most caring. He knows his stuff and his students have the upper hand come exam time. | Likes to say 'wuh' alot. Nice guy and helpful. But hard to understand the way he teaches. Handouts are online. Not all notes tho. Easier than Boikess though but O'Connors the best. | not the best teacher...lecture sux...but his online notes are muchh more legible than O'conners...takes his own sweet time explaning things and really unclear....but hes really VERY nice and will do almost anything to help you out in any way you can. hes the best person to email to =) | never showed up to class, pretty sure he's a decent lecturer, but will DEFINITELY put u to sleep. notes are online, study that and the book, save urself 3+ hours a week. | Talks in the same tone for the whole lecture, so never really emphasizes something...makes you feel sleepy. But if u can stay up..and listen hard..u find he is very intelligent and lectures are informative. Try 2 read book before comin 2 lecture..go over practice exams with him..he's VERY nice | Warmuth is a nice and helpful teacher, but he just sucks at teaching in class. His accent is def a problem and he cant seem to articulate things well enough. Overall his lectures are boring Better off not going to lecture and use that time more wisely. | I really hated orgo - both undergrad and grad - but he made it not so bad. He was helpful with questions, and I don't think his accent is all that bad. Yes, O'Connor's lectures are more interesting (had him for 308), but he's a lecturer. Try suffering thru Roth's lectures... | To put it lightly...whoever hired him should be shot. It took him 30 minutes to find a light switch the first day of lecture and he was unprepared. He also has an inability to teach and articulate. Stay home and read the book. | sucks as a lecturer...ended up stop going to lecture...just read from the text and take notes from it and you'll be fine...recitation pointless. | You cant understand a word he says because his accent is so thick, and he teaches SO slow. He doesn't prepare you for the exam, so you're better of just reading the textbook. Everybody ends up going to O'connor's lecture | Everything is not ""oight"" with Dr.Warmuth. After the first test, you will realize he has no clue how to prepare you for the exams and he just tries to teach you straight out of the book. You are better off on your own or go to O'Connor. | Such a hot butt! He's German, so that brings the clarity down a little, but he's still hot!"
"Zhang, Hongmei","She's a very sweet woman who wants you to do well. Out of the 3 lecturers, she definitely had the best slides and examples. Sometimes her handwriting was messy, but was very responsive to questions. | I studied by myself for entire semester cuz I barely understood what she says in the lecture. You better be familiar with using textbook if your planning to take this professor. | Is not very helpful when it comes to breaking down problems and concepts. | Orgo at Rutgers is just rough. I found her lectures hard to follow and her explanations during them fairly poor. But, her lecture notes are decent to study from. I would take this prof if you are good at teaching yourself material. Study often and at least two weeks prior to exams since there is so much content and your grade is only exams. | Not the best professor, but she is accessible outside of class and cares about her students doing well. Ask for help, ask questions, and read the textbook and do the practice problems. | Orgo at Rutgers is not great regardless of professors. Zhang is a nice lady but randomly starts laughing during her lectures. She does not do a great job explaining material. You learn mostly during homework problems but then exams questions seem to be completely different (at least online). She is willing to explain if you do not understand."
"O'Connor, Patrick","Wonderful professor! | I have no idea who allowed this guy to teach. He is clueless if his students are learning. Everyone ends with an A but no one learns anything. No hate to his accent but nobody can understand what hes saying too. Take this class if its a requirement. But if you want to learn statistics, it's useless. | Professor Rojas is a sweet and caring instructor, but I would only suggest taking his course if you need to fill a requirement. If you are planning on taking another statistics-heavy course, I would suggest taking a different instructor. I unfortunately did not find his lectures to be helpful. This class is otherwise an easy A in my opinion. | Dont even bother showing up to lectures, you wont learn anything. Even if you follow along with what he is teaching, the material on hw and exams is not even close. The only saving grace for this class was that all exams were online and not monitored so you could look up answers. Take him if you want an A, but not if you want to learn. | lectures make absolutely no sense so no one shows up; exams are take home and homework is extra credit | He is such a sweet guy! A bit hard to understand, but if you pay attention and come to class you should be fine. Stay on top of your work, the hw is only extra credit. The exams are pretty straightforward and the material he does cover. He is so funny and definitely a character, but once you start understanding his accent, you'll be fine | loved him. | Everyone who is saying he is hard to understand is lazy. He is very sweet and wants everyone to understand. You just have to listen properly and be attentive. | We alr don't understand the material bc we're here to learn. That plus his raspy, mumbly voice makes it hard to focus in class. Day before Thanksgiving, was a Wed, Rutgers stated we must attend our Friday classes instead. He made us attend both our Wed & Fri lectures the SAME DAY when ppl have regular Fri lectures they needed to attend that day. | Professor Rojas is a really sweet man. Not sure his teaching style is good for the course. Grade is only based on three exams and three extra credit homeworks. He spends too much time going over stat crunch which to be honest I didn't even buy/download. Towards the end of the course only 5 people basically showed up to class. | Prof. Rojas tries his best to engage students with occasional analogies or stories which usually turn into unnecessary ramblings. Also, he is very difficult to understand because he has a thick accent as well as a raspy voice. I'd recommend coming into this with prior knowledge of stat and if you go to lectures, sit up close. READ BOOK/DO RESEARCH | It is very easy to get an A in this class, but Professor Rojas is not really equipped to handle this class. Doesnt explain anything well, doesnt do any example problems in class, and doesnt allow for any participation in lectures. If you read the textbook though, the three exams are easy. Very little homework too. | Trash. Graded by 3 tests, and 3 Hw. He literally takes 1 year to reply to emails. Didn't grade my final hw. Ended the course with an 89.7 and wouldn't give me an A. The tests are google searchable but the numbers are all changed so you can't copy the answer. Don't bother going to class its pointless. Skim the book and do 1/2 practice problems. | 3 exams, 3 HWs, thats it. thats the grade. prof had terrible mic, combined with thick accent & softspoken natureSO HARD to understand. i stopped going to class after a month bc he never interacted w students during the class. straight lectures. exams had EC qs on them (blessing: easier than regular ones), but youll have to teach yourself :/ | Professor Rojas is extremely hard to understand so I had to teach myself all of the material. He does not check the chat for questions or engage with students in any way. Grade is based on three open-book tests plus extra credit. Not a horrible course if you are okay with teaching yourself, but I would not recommend taking Stats with Rojas. | I couldn't hear or understand this guy unless I sat in the very front row, and even if I could hear him he rarely ever stayed on topic, so I ended up skipping most classes and just reading the textbook and calling my dad for help. Tests were open book and open laptop though, so most people just googled every answer. Easy A but I didn't learn much. | Prof. Rojas was difficult to understand at times, but I enjoyed his class nonetheless. All exams were open book. I wouldn't have done as well if I didn't review the material in the textbook before the exams. It is very possible to get an A without attending lecture as long as you use the textbook to become familiar with material. | By far the worst professor I have ever had. Going to class is absolutely pointless because he'll just ramble on about things without telling the class what he is even talking about and on top of that he is super hard to understand. If you want to actually learn and pass stats definitely avoid him at all costs. | Just don't | Rojas is one of the worst professor at Rutgers. He is impossible to understand and he says nothing relevant to the material that will be on the exam. His exams were so unfair that he took off questions so that most of the class wouldn't fail. While I did well, I would recommend you avoid at all costs if you want to learn something. | Easy A, but did not teach anything. He speaks extremely softly and most of the class leaves after the first hour because going to class makes no difference on your grade since the exams are just totally random and out of left field. All of our exams were take home based on how to use R programming software, and I'm pretty sure everyone go an A. | Calculus is difficult for sure. However, this class with this professor was the best combination I ever experienced. Would take again and recommend over and over again. | This professor wanted me to succeed. So I did. Shout outs to him. | I don't know why so many people say this class is hard, it was probably the easiest math course I had ever taken, compared to other classes. | This professor wants you to pass, you just have to try | This class was difficult. But honestly the easiest math by far. Would take AGAIN for sure | The GOAT | It was the best class I could have ever taken tbh | The literal best Professor I ever had. Would take him again 10/10 | If I had to take another class with him I would. Easy A | This Professor is the realist tbh | This professor was the best I ever had | Incredibly adorable but lectures are all verbal. | He is not a good lecturer. Handwriting is bad and you cannot hear him clearly even sitting in the second row. If you truly want to learn something because this class seems very close to real life applications, the textbook is your friend. Exams are ridiculously easy. Just make sure you don't make mistakes like p-value 1 or he will get mad at you. | This may be the hardest class if you are majoring or minoring in Stats. Just as hard as Calc 151. He's making the class harder with exams that does not relate to the course and covers abstract grad level stats since too many people scored A's on the first exam. Good luck getting at least a C now. | Spends most of the time reading off the textbook and puts questions on the exam that were never taught in lecture or from the textbook. Not sure what he is trying to achieve in this class. | This class has the potential to be interesting and useful given today's society. However, this part-time lecturer destroyed the chance of achieving this potential since he read off the textbook, has illegible handwriting and a thick accent, left-fielded exams, and did not let us leave early like other 3-hour classes. | This man may be intelligent, but he is not fit to teach. He does not care about his students or whether they understand the material, unapproachable, no announcements, and unclear about the concepts that are on the exams. Exam questions are abstract and require a good working knowledge of programming and Linear Algebra. | One of the worst professors at this school with a terrible grading scale. No curve, 71 is a C and vice versa. Reviews do not help and teaches one chapter that is over 100 pages per lecture. It is also almost impossible to do well on the exams since every question covers concepts never taught in class before. | Rojas is a twin to Perelman since the exams have nothing to do with any aspect of the course meaning that the grade you earn is out of your hands since there is no way to prepare for the exams. I used to make the Dean's List but with this class on the schedule I am not sure. I have a lot of respect for the people who get 'A's. | This part-time lecturer should sit in a few Expos or maybe even Basic Comp classes so he can learn to be more coherent and organize things better in terms of format since exams have nothing to do with the lectures, textbook, and homework assignments. Questions are randomly pulled from the sky. Also, his handwriting is difficult to understand. | All the questions on the exams come from the left-field making this course difficult to pass. There is also no curve. I received A's in all previous statistics courses but am having a hard time passing this course due to this reason. Notes are also unclear and no practice exams. | Never got a low grade in any statistics class. Well, I guess Roja's class isn't really a science course. It should be changed to Contour 101. If you are a stat major or minor, you will regret this since stats is supposed to one of the most important class before graduate school or the workforce. | Rojas makes this course more difficult than it needs to be with his difficult exams, accent, and handwriting. The textbook is your best friend in this course. | This is a tough class to follow along with. Lectures are long and incomprehensible due to damage on his aging voice and his handwriting. Over 200 pages of material with more than 200 formulas and 20 tests for the exams. You have to be able to tell which is the appropriate test to use under a given scenario along with replication vs. reputation. | Probably one of the worst professors at Rutgers (includes Perelman from Calc 151). Lectures have nothing to do with the exams. Cannot understand his handwriting or what he is saying. Also he thinks that he is high and mighty. | Lectures are difficult to understand due to his hoarse voice. Also difficult to read his handwriting on the board, leaving students to spend hours self-studying for the exam by writing the whole book in the cheat sheet for the exam, which is not effective since there are thousands of tests and formulas that students need to master. | Without writing everything on a cheat sheet, you are fried bacon with a side of toast and scrambled eggs. Does not clearly explain the concepts, no examples in class, and illegible handwriting. Requires hours of studying on top of six other classes making it difficult. Do not take with him unless you want to become breakfast. | Slides are from the book and does not have clear handwriting. It is probably more efficient to just down, read the textbook, and do the practice problems by yourself. | I believe that this class exists as a gatekeeper to grad school and careers for Stats majors and minors. The material is close to impossible to grasp with the way he presents it. I used to make Dean's List but with this course on the schedule I am not sure. I have a lot of respect for people who get A's in this class."
"Altinis, Christine","Unlike other inept professors at RU chem department, professor Altinis is only instructor who not only knows how to teach but also loves to teach. Put in the work and if you are lost, go to her office hours!!! She does an unbelievable job of explaining certain things that could be hard especially in orgo 1! She's a godsend to chem department. | Professor Altinis-Kiraz learned every student's name in the 300 person lecture and cared about each of their learning paths. She was very attentive to students struggling and answered all questions tot he best of her ability. I would suggest sitting towards the front, asking questions, and going to office hours if possible. | Although coming from a first-semester freshman, this was the best course I've taken so far. Not sure why there's so many negative reviews. Getting Dr. Altinis with extended gen chem is a cheat code to getting a good grade and learning the material as well. She gives so many opportunities for extra credit, extra support, and motivation to do better. | She was very lecture- and test-heavy; she did a good amount of homework at the beginning of the semester but stopped in the middle. She can be very intimidating to talk to as she does not seem to care much about you/ you grades if she does not know who you are. I would recommend going to office hours and joining a study group, but it's still hard. | Barely prepares students for exams and quizzes. | orgo is difficult regardless but she explains and simplifies the material nicely. took her over the summer & she gave hw & weekly quizzes. the recitations & her extra practice sessions helped for the exams. questions on exams were similar to the ones shown in class. towards the end her lectures were rushed bc of time but still recommend her. | Overall, a pretty good professor. You can tell that she genuinely wants her students to succeed. Not always the best lecturer, but great at office hour explanations. Gives lots of practice problems and opportunities for grade bumps, and exams generally reflect what she goes over in lecture/recitation. | In the beginning, Professor Altinis was the ideal orgo professor- she was thorough in her explanations about concepts and what she expected of us on exams. Near the end of the semester though, her lectures were all over the place, but in the beginning she was great. She's also a relatively fair grader and gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. | Altinis is an angel sent from heaven. I was never good at chemistry but it is really obvious she's passionate about the subject and wants all her students to succeed. The recitations are so helpful and she's always there to answer your questions. Would 100% take her again if I could | She was very nice, however, her lectures were sometimes hard to follow. But again, its chemistry. She also gives you a lot of opportunities to get points outside of exams/ quizzes to help you pass. (Playposits, Surveys, grade boost for submitting recitation worksheets, etc) I would recommend her. | Altinis is a good professor who wants her students to succeed. The class is set up for your success and the curves are usually pretty good. If you attend lecture and recitation and do all the practice then you should be fine. | Honestly confused as to why her rating is so low. I took her class this past semester and she was a very caring prof. Her lectures matter, but recitation matters the most. I skipped lectures a lot so that's why I got a bad grade lol so definitely go to class. She can get confusing sometimes, but she is very helpful one-on-one. | She genuinely wants you to understand and she teachs in a way that makes it very clear what's expected of you in the exams. However she rushes too much at the end and doesn't emphasize mechanisms as much as she should to set you up for orgo 2. But hands down best orgo professor for orgo 1, if only she taught orgo 2. | Nice teacher but very difficult and not as lenient as you might hope. She's a tough grader but you can do well if you really really try. | Professor Altinis is definitely an extremely competent chemist, but having her as my first chemistry teacher was a bit rough. Her lectures pack so much information into the time given. But it's to the point where if you aren't paying attention, can't attend, or skip class, you will have to do a lot of catching up outside of class. | She is a really nice professor but you have to really understand the material in order to pass her class. | Professor Altinis is a great professor that cares about chemistry as a whole. Her lectures follow the textbook pretty well and she posts her annotated notes after the class is over. The class can be hard at times, but you can always ask her questions and she will help you understand the topics as a whole. She also gives extra credit surveys. | She's a great professor, very passionate about chemistry, and truly wants all students to succeed in the course. Also, there are plenty of opportunities to earn points in this course. Attendance is not mandatory but she definitely notices the students who show up for every class. | I took extended general chemistry1. She is INCREDIBLY passionate about chem. The lectures are not mandatory to attend and the slides are taken straight from the textbook (which you can find PDFs of online) ABSOLUTELY GO TO RECITATION theyre the only time youll learn how to do test problems. Exams are super hard so start studying asap with elearning | I disliked her as my professor. She was not understanding at all and went through lectures fast. The rest of the ratings were right about her being passive-agressive in her emails and always changed up the syllabus. | The worst professor ever. | Compared to the orgo2 professor we had for summer 2, Altinis was AMAZING. She is hard but looking back she truly wanted us to learn. You will definitely need to work for your grades, but she gives many opportunities for you to ask questions and learn! Super fair, and creates interactive recitations which help. HW/assignments added to grades plus! | Really disliked her class. The prof fostered a poor learning space, often just rushing through important concepts and remarking in condescending ways if students asked her any questions. Criteria of grades were not clear, changed syllabus multiple times during the summer session unannounced. This just wasn't it. | During lecture, she would constantly tell students to stop playing ""victim"" when all they wanted to know was a question that many students were afraid to ask in regards to the class material. She would barely answer emails and if she did, most times they were passive-aggressive. One of the most condescending professors I've ever had. | Just do yourself a favor and don't take her. She might be a decent professor during the fall or spring semester but do not take her during the summer because she cannot handle the fast pace as a professor | She made a bad impression on me for her constant want for students to not make excuses, even with a global pandemic occurring. She wants her students to work for the answers and so sometimes wouldn't say what is correct. She did provide a lot of extra work (without keys), so I respected that. Putting in work with her is MANDATORY. | Not good at all | Honestly, a fairly solid professor and gives reasonable expectations given the circumstances. If you just put your head down and grind a high A (in the 90s) is super doable and you can be well above average if you spend 6-7 hours per day studying. OChem in the summer is a character builder and this course will test your discipline to stay on track. | The most disorganized professor I've ever had. Changed the syllabus so many times up until the very end. We received majority of the grades back literally right before we ended class, and it wasn't even accurate. Very passive aggressive when it comes to accessing her outside of class for help, so she wasn't very helpful at all. | Better than other orgo professors teaching wise but since it was a summer course she did rush through a lot of materials. She does take a long time to get grades back and she did change the grading scale on us several times without telling us, including taking away our extra credit, but overall she wasn't that bad of a professor. | She goes over her lectures super fast but she also record the entire thing and post the annotated notes so you can go over after class. She explains the concepts pretty well and demonstrates how to solver certain problems that might appear on the exam. Personally I like her style a lot. It does take her a LONG time to post grades tho. | Not the best not the worst. Compared to other orgo proff, she is good Goes fast in lecture email her nicely and she will reply nicely&fast averages for exams will be 50% get at least 5 point above class average and you will get a B or higher IT IS AN ORGO CLASS, IT WONT BE EASY ANYWHERE Exams and quizzes will challenge you | As much as there are positive comments, I believe they were all made when she wasn't a professor, because she deserves nothing more than a one rating. Her lectures were incredibly disorganized, to the point that I basically taught myself this semester and had to rely on TAs/LAs for help. If you know anything about orgo, you know how tough that is. | 1. She changed the syllabus & grading scale 4 times without telling us 2. She is condescending when responding to emails regarding the grading scale and exam answers 3. Extremely unorganized professor. Did not tell us what materials will be on the exam/quiz until the night before. She release the final practice exam a day before the final. | She changed the grading scale 4 different times w/o informing us. She originally said there was extra credit & then got rid of it and she said on our first exam we could use a cheat sheet & then changed her mind the day before the exam. She also doesn't release grades even though the TA graded it. She decided to add topics on our exam & not tell us | Orgo is difficult and taking it in summer would be stressful BUT she made everything harder than it should be. She was passionate but extremely disorganized and unhelpful, and assumed we were cheating at the first place. Assignments and quizzes were not graded until exams were over, and she blamed everything on technical difficulties. | Professor Altinis is the best chemistry professor at Rutgers. Is her class easy? Of course not, it's orgo. But is it possible to get an A? Absolutely. She has lectures and active-learning workshops, which are extremely helpful. Her office hours are key! She is extremely caring and truly wants her students to succeed, but you have to work for it. | DO NOT TAKE ORGO 2 WITH THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR GPA AND TIME. The class was so disorganized, from receiving feedback on assessments about 3 weeks later to being assessed on material that was supposed to be taught in upcoming classes. 2 of my quizzes this semester had been regraded 3 times by this professor! Ended up learning from TB | CAK is such a great professor. Summer Orgo is a really fast paced course and its up to the individual to ensure they are understanding the material well enough, but Prof. Altinis helps so much in office hours and gives confidence to her students. Her exams are extremely fair and she cares about all the students especially those that are struggling. | Do not take her in the summer if you can't learn at the speed of light! She moves through material wayyyy too fast. I get that the summer classes have to be pretty condensed, but this class was just ridiculously fast especially for the people who need to really understand organic chemistry who are later taking biochemistry and orgo II. | She is a very caring teacher who wants her students to succeed. The class isn't easy but no organic chemistry class at rutgers is, but she does help you learn more than most organic chemistry teachers at rutgers. If you put in the time you will succeed. one downside is when i took it not all the answers were given. | Excellent Orgo Instructor. Take it with her! | If you come to love orgo youll be able to spend 8+ hrs/day studying it. Key is prep.. read the book chs and lecture notes (chs typically took me 4-8 hrs to complete, including the green in text problems). Recitations dont seem so fast as mentioned in poor reviews here; youll find it fun trying to keep up w/ this genius of a women, trust me | CAK is a gift from above. She is the reason I succeeded in Orgo 307/308 with Boikess. She taught my active-learning session (engaging af) and gave me the knowledge and confidence I needed to do well. She's more than accessible outside of class, and her office hours are heads above the rest. She can confidently answer questions unlike some other TAs | Honestly if you pay attention in class and the recitations then you will definetly get an A. She is very helpful in coming up with ways to know the material without hours of useless memorization. Also her feedback helps you consolidate information and actually learn the material. | she did not teach chem 162 very well. she would go through chem example problems really quickly on the powerpoint slides, so its impossible to understand what she's doing until you read the textbook. She also graded many students incorrectly for attendance due to app issues, but could not fix the problem. | Professor Altinis-Kiraz is amazing! She is super sweet, genuine and kind, I absolutely love her! She is definitely my all-time fav! Sure, her classes are hard; the subject itself is difficult. But like with anything, if you give it your all: go to lecture, office hours, and read the textbook - you'll do great! | Her lectures were usually unclear and too quick. She wasn't good at explaining concepts even though a majority of the test questions were concepts. The test averages were also lower than most semester averages. I would have taken the class with another professor if given a second chance. | she is new chem 2 teacher and would not prefer to take it with her. the class itself isnt the easiest and her teaching makes it a lot worse. Her teaching is very unclear and makes going to class more confused with the material. I would prefer to take it with another professor even though everyone takes the same exam regardless of the professor is | I got a D when I took Orgo 1 with Boikes, and to be honest, I should've failed based on how little I knew. But when I took Orgo 2 over the summer with Christine I aced the class. She really stresses active learning and if you go to lecture / recitation / office hours with her, you will know how the exam is going to be. My queen."
"Taylor, John","Professor Taylor is the best professor I've had in all of Rutgers. I had him for Orgo 1 in spring 2020 . Yes, the class got much more difficult when it was online, but when it was in-person it was the class I enjoyed the most out of all. Taylor has precise lectures, teaching you everything you need to know for the exam. Exams were very fair. | He is a gem in the orgo department. Really does care and tries to help all the students. Makes you feel connected to the class and truly tries his best to make sure everyone understands. Even provides his own lecture notes. May not be the best explainer at times but a good professor especially with all the terrible ones there are in the orgo depart | Taylor is a great professor his notes are extremely thorough so you don't need to read the textbook. He lets you know what to expect on exams. Stay on top of your work and you'll be fine. An 84 was an A in our class. Final exam is worth a lot of points so even if you don't do well on one of the 3 exams you can still bring your grade up. | Prof. Taylor helps orgo become less daunting. I believe if not for the pandemic personally impacting me, an A with him is very achievable. He has a deep understanding of the material, but this sometimes meant he went too into theory than what felt necessary. He offers extra help before tests and truly wants his students to succeed. | Writing out all the mechanisms to use during open notes exams helped A LOT. His notes explained everything clearly. Timing was an issue on the exams esp with bad wifi. I ended with a B+ and the cutoff for an A was changed to an 84. Watch a lot of Organic Chem Tutor, do the assigned textbook problems, study early! | Professor taylor makes orgo possible. If you need extra resources, clear exams, and someone whos always willing to help, take professor taylor! He wants you to do well and encourages it. You always know your grade and exam questions are never a surprise. | the best orgo professor ever! really made orgo so much easier!! he's the best and really want you to do well! do the textbook problems and take good notes! Orgo with him really isnt as bad as they make it out to be! | A fantastic teacher. Knows his stuff, clear explanations at a reasonable pace, humble, and not dismissive. Chose an excellent text, with a phenomenal answer key which students can buy. Office hours (thankfully, held right after class!), and in-person recitations, are a must. Find a group, study regularly, ask questions, and the grades should come. | The absolute best Orgo teacher there is. I took him for off season Orgo this semester and I went in thinking Orgo was going to be difficult. However, I worked really hard and got an A. It is definitely not impossible but he will make you work for your grade. There is a little curve but the exams are very fair. | Never teach anything practical in class and ask for student to think up individually(then whats his job). Although you write right procedure he still give you low grade. | Prof Taylor is a super nice guy, but really just an okay professor. He isn't specific about what will be on exams and reading the textbook doesn't help. Quizzes are collaborative, but that doesn't make them easier unless the person next to you really knows their stuff. Go to class, study your notes and make sure you study his past exams. | I respect him, hes very nice and always tries to answer questions to the best of his ability, but honestly hes okay as a teacher hes not amazing in my opinion. He says you need the textbook for practice questions before quizzes/tests but honestly i found it to be useless, i studied off my notes, quizzes and practice tests. | Throw your chem degree in the garbage if you have not taken a class with him. Orgo is not the nightmare that Boikess' gang has been trying to teach us. Taylor makes it FUN. Exams are off his lectures yet a bit difficult. Average was 61, and curve 5+ points. Lab reports take some time, so count it as 4Cr not 2.5. | Hands down the greatest chemistry professor at Rutgers. He really puts time and effort into his lectures, and makes class fun. His assessments are more than do-able, just need to put the time into understanding his lectures and practicing the mechanisms/memorizing things. | Professor Taylor is my favorite professor at Rutgers University. He concisely conveys the information while highlighting the important points we need to know. When studying for his class, if you know the chemical principles behind each of the practice test questions, the exams will be a breeze. | Answers questions very well and though his lectures are long they aren't boring. | You can tell that he is passionate about what he is teaching and understands it very well but he does not do a very good job of teaching to his students. The exams are only 25 questions and the notes were hard to follow. He is a good person but an okay teacher. You have to do a lot of work yourself. | I hated chemistry before taking his class but he made it interesting and now I've become really good at it. You don't have to go to class because he puts all his notes online but I recommend that you go on quiz days which are once a week. And the quizzes really prepare you for what is going to be on the exam. He posts quiz and exam answers, too. | I took Orgo 2 in the summer. It was possibly the best class that I ever took at Rutgers. Professor Taylor is a wonderful lecturer that makes Orgo very clear and easy to understand. Lots of practice materials for exams and quizzes were provided, which were all very helpful. Professor Taylor always was happy to help any student with questions. | Prof. Taylor is a Chemistry rock star! He is willing to help you out in office hours and does his best to make sure you succeed. The key to getting a good grade is to: read the text and do the practice problems, make every quiz and test count, and do the homework as well. Even though this class is not easy, you can still pass if you put in effort! | He's an incredible guy. The class is really what you get from it. He provides you with all the information that you need to succeed. He posts his notes on Sakai and gives you weekly quizzes that closely resemble the exams. Study for those quizzes like you would for an exam and you will excel. He is very understanding and helpful. Favorite professor | Go to lecture, study previous exams, he was very straightforward with what you do in orgo lab 2. He's really nice in office hours too and he has a great curve. Class would be much more stressful if he wasn't very lenient with grading. | Because of Taylor, I think orgo was probably one of my favorite classes at Rutgers. He was a wonderful lecturer, very clear and extremely approachable. | Overall he was a great professor and really understood that the class was not an easy one. He is always willing to work with you and work around your schedule. He has test reviews before each exam which are helpful. Great teacher. | He is one of the best professors at Rutgers. He is definitely the easiest orgo professor, but his exams are still difficult. If you have any problems trying to understand the material, ask him for help; he will spend time after class making sure you understand. Taylor really made Orgo an enjoyable experience. | Professor Taylor is very clear and organized with his lectures and he helps you actually understand the subject. Definitely take Chemistry 308 with him. The exams are quite straightforward and come from what is covered in class and the textbook. Good luck! | He was very clear, gave lots of examples and told you the sections you needed out of the textbook. He gives 3 years worth of practice exams which are very helpful. | Professor Taylor is one of the best professors I have ever had at Rutgers. He is incredibly knowledgable, and knows how to convey that information, step-by-step, so it really sticks. He is not out to trick you or fail you-- the exams are very straightforward. You put the effort in, he will give you the grade you deserve. No more orgo nightmares | You should attend all review session, many office hour, study 2hrs/day, ask questions, go to tutoring, form study groups, review EVERY last one of his practice and past exams. You can find more of his exams by googling it. Almost every question repeats in some form, with the exception of only a few. I didn't read every single chapter. I got an A. | THE easiest Orgo professor at Rutgers. You want to arrange your schedule so that you can take him! Don't be fooled by the ratings, orgo is not easy by any stretch of the imagination. What it is, is that he is clear and makes a difficult subject easy to understand. His exams are easy-fair. He can be rude and moody but who cares. An A is attainable. | Taylor is amazing. You would have to be really stupid to not take this class off season as it's 10x easier! He explains everything very clearly and his notes are super helpful. He does tend to cover the material a little fast sometimes, though. If you put in the effort, an A is attainable. | Definitely the best orgo professor in Rutgers | Best ORGO professor at Rutgers offers great explanation in lecture | Professor Taylor is the best Organic Professor at Rutgers hands down. In NO way is this class easy, but he makes an A an atainable goal by holding numerous office hours, and making the material more than understandable. As a person, he's a funny approachable person who makes you want to learn the subject by the way that he acts. 100% Recommend | The people that are hating on O'Connor most likely didn't do any work. Go to all of the lectures, ask questions, take notes, do practice problems and RE-DO them and you'll get an A. If you get upset about him poking fun at you sometimes, then you're not ready for the outside world. Overall a great professor, but HE can't get you an A, only you can. | BEST ORGO PROFESSOR AT RUTGERS. Will help you no matter what. Orgo is a tough subject but with him it's taught in a fair manner. Still hard, but it's possible to do well if you study and understand instead of memorizing. | Great Professor! He really wants you to do well, but with that said the grade is all up to you. He's a very fair grader and trys to make Orgo as interesting as possible. He also goes out of his way to help by holding reviews & office hours where he actually explains things. | Prof. Taylor is a good Professor esp. in comparison to the other Orgo prof (Boikess, Roth etc). He's really friendly, and likes to make corny jokes showing that he's a very approachable Professor. Orgo is a tough class, so obviously you have to work hard. You just can't avoid it. | Orgo 307/308 with Dr. Taylor in the Spring-Summer/Fall is worth taking but by no means easy.Its set up so that if you work hard and learn the material you will do well (80%=A,65=B, 50=C). Dr.Taylor wants you to learn the material and hes extremely helpful with his notes and review sessions, so ur always prepared for his exams. Great prof, take him! | Tough professor/tough class. Mc and open ended exams. Class curve is set from the beginning, so it doesn't matter how everyone does. But, comparing him to Boikess and others, his class is a little easier because his curve is better. But his teaching style and his exams are similar in my opinion. Very tough course so expect to work hard. | Organic Chemistry is difficult but Taylor knows how to explain it very well. He makes the class easier. Go to lecture and his office hours. Exams are difficult but doing the practice exams is helpful. | I took 307 with boikes etc. during fall, worked so hard and got a B+. They made me fear orgo. then I took 308 in the summer with Taylor, it was amazing. He is clear and straight forward. I studied the problems well but not crazy and got an easy A. | If you can, and if you can afford to take orgo 308 in the summer, take him over O'Connor, BOIKES!!!, and etc. He teaches orgo 307 during the spring and orgo 308 during the summer. Especially for pharmacy kids, when you're taking system physiology, you'll be glad that you took orgo 1 during the spring with system physiology than orgo 2. He's GREAT! | Best professor I've ever had at Rutgers, though he doesn't even know it. Compared to Roth, Boik, and OConnor...nevermind those teachers can't even compare. Taylor is by far the most helpful and nicest professor I've ever had. If he ever reads this, I hope he knows he made my experience with Orgo very bearable. | take Pr. Taylor for your org and you will benefit and save GPA. Does not use the power points, explains A++++. Rutgers needs more like him. | Phenomenal Professor. Blows O'Connor out of the water, and I can say that because I've had O'Connor. He is amazing at explaining everything and is one of the fairest teachers I have ever met. Orgo is not an easy task and requires lots of study time and practice, Taylor simplifies it all. Hands down my favorite Rutgers professor so far. | Great guy. Teaches in a very clear and understandable manner. If you must take orgo, this man is a blessing. His exams are difficult but VERY FAIR. Which is a big deal if you've ever taken a Boikess course. | Couldn't ask for a better professor, especially when having dealing with the horror that is Organic Chemistry. John Taylor runs his lectures very clearly and in an organized manner. The tests are hard, but fair. If you have to take Orgo, you should be extremely grateful to have this professor. | He is a really great teacher! His tests are a bit of a challenge, no wonder he has that pre-set curve! But, overall he is great. | EPIC!!!! best chemistry prof I've ever had. Teaches orgo the way it should be taught. cool accent. really nice. makes orgo seem easy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Williams, Lawrence","Super caring and understanding guy. His love for teaching is really apparent. The material is difficult, but organic chemistry isn't the most intuitive thing. He's also kinda funny in an old man, dad way. Very enjoyable lecture, I truly enjoyed his class. I highly recommend taking it if you have the opportunity! | This class goes WAY more in depth than non honors orgo. If you want to learn and understand organic chemistry, and not just memorize, this class is for you. Lr is a gem; ask him if you have questions, he goes above and beyond and really cares about his students. You'll have to work for your grade, but, if you do, you will succeed. | Professor Williams is by far my favorite professor and instructor I have ever had. The class is structured like this: multiple weekly videos that he made about the chapter or chapters, then you come to class and he discusses. Do not be fooled by other people here, if you do the work you will succeed. And he tells funny stories. | I was skeptical about taking this class since it would be harder than normal orgo. I am very glad that I chose the honors version. LR is one of the best profs out there, he is very caring and will answer every one of your questions. It is okay to feel a bit dumb in his lectures; the guy is a genius! If you want to really learn orgo, take this class | If you want to understand chemistry, you take Honors Orgo with LW. I haven't met a teacher more passionate about their subject than LW, and it's his goal to give you the resources to love chemistry as much as him. It's a lot of work, but you can certainly pass if you follow his advice on what to really hammer in and learn. Top tier class. | Dr. Williams is top notch teaching faculty. Make sure to come to class prepared having already read the textbook and watched pre-lecture videos. Make sure to ask questions in class that he alludes to in pre-lecture. | Orgo is ofcourse the most feared subject for a premed. Taking it with Dr. Williams makes it a bit more bearable. He will make you work for your grade but as long as you put in the work and time he will take care of you grade wise. | One of the best professors I've had at Rutgers. The class itself is very difficult but if you put the time in, Professor Williams will make sure you get a good grade. The breakdown is about 50% of the class gets an A, the next 25ish get a B+, the last 25 get like a B/C. In other words, you have to really bomb the exams to get below a B. | This class is not a walk in the park but Professor Williams is a gem! He understands that this is not easy material and right from the onset, he helps to calm students' nerves. He's a very humble man who is incredibly brilliant. Schedule one-on-one help sessions with him! He's very happy to help and genuinely cares about his students! | Simply unbelievable. Perhaps one of the hardest courses you may take, but the challenge is forever worth it. Organic chemistry is hard enough, but Professor Williams gives an incredible experience, but it's one that you'll have to earn. However, the lessons learned are ones you'll keep for years to come. Dr. Williams is unforgettable in every way! | Honors orgo is very hard. It is very hard to get an A because you are competing against some of the smartest students at Rutgers. Only take it if you are up for the challenge. That said, Dr. Williams is a very caring person and professor, who really cares about his students and their futures. I absolutely adore him. | i'd rather study myself than get overcompliated by simple things he expained | I really wouldnt think the material is structured properly. He never talks about the mechanism of how science works but require you to rote memorize | This class is difficult, but Professor Williams is truly an expert in his field and does a great job trying to have us understand organic chemistry, rather than memorize everything. The exams are tough, but he curves extremely well, with the MAJORITY of the class receiving an A. He has such a kind soul and is truly a great Professor and person. | If you get an opportunity to take Honors Orgo with Professor williams do not hesistate. You will absolutely regret not taking it with him. He outlines exactly what is expected and as long as you do those things (which is a lot, but still) you will be fine for the exams. He genuinely cares not only about orgo but your future. Overall must take. | NOT an easy A, and not an easier option especially since Boikess doesn't teach 307/308. You're expected to master the material before lecture, which becomes difficult and even then lectures can be confusing. Grades are determined all from exams, which are very difficult | This class is an absolute train wreck. He doesnt teach during lecture, and instead expects you to learn on your own with videos he made years ago. Exams are absolutely insane. Dont be fooled by the bottom reviews; its still very hard to get an A. You are competing against some of the smartest students at Rutgers. Take 307 off season instead. | He lectures very disorganized and it's really hard to follow what he's saying in lecture unless you already know the material. Watch all of his videos multiple times before lecture or else during the lecture you'll be lost for the most of it. The curve for this class is really good though, but it's still a lot of self studying. | Hardest course I've ever taken. Lecture videos must be watched multiple times and make sure to read the textbook. The curve is high because you are in a classroom filled with some of the smartest students in your grade - do not assume this is an easy A compared to 307-308 just because the curve is high. Worth taking if you're up for a challenge | This class requires a lot of dedication and discipline to watching videos and reading the textbook before lectures. Utilize both Bobby's and Dr. Williams' office hours as they're good to answer a lot of the doubts you may have. Dr. Williams is truly a very caring person as he motivated me in the end of the semester while I faced a personal problem. | By far the most challenging thing I did in my educational career so far. This course demands a lot of time spent reading the textbook/watching posted lecture videos outside of class and wrapping your 3D mind around organic chemistry. In the long run, you'll realize that taking this course with Prof. Williams was worth it. | Hardest class I've taken at Rutgers. It's a lot of material and a lot of work. Kind of a reversed lecture class where he sends video lectures out before class and you discuss them in class. He is really enthusiastic about the material and really wants you to succeed. curves so that a lot of students get As. | The class itself is hard and students are held to a high standard. Working through the challenges really helped me develop a deep understanding of not just organic chemistry but also of modeling and problem solving. You learn a lot but you have to work for your grade. | Probably the best teacher I have ever had. Take his class if you can because you will learn a lot and be prepared for the MCAT. | One of the most challenging courses Ive taken at Rutgers! There is a lot of self-studying and it is a big time commitment but as long as you put in the work, you will come out with a solid understanding of the subject. There is a big curve and a large portion of the class gets an A. | Definitely the hardest class I have taken at Rutgers so far. It's not necessarily that the material is hard to master - its just A LOT of material. That said, Dr. Williams is a great prof who cares about his students. If you put in the work (which is a lot!!) you should do well. (The video lectures tend to be little long, so be prepared for that.) | get ready to teach yourself orgo | he is not a good professor. Talk about gibberish too much | I mean orgo is hard because its not like any science class you might have taken before so anywhere you go you will most likely be cursing your professors. But this is man is definetely better than other limited options rutgers students have. This class is all about mastering how to go about learning the material. Once it clicks youre there! | Expects you to have a solid understanding of the material before class (sometimes has non-graded quizzes at the start of lecture) so the format of the actual lecture is largely Q&A. Posts video lectures for every chapter, understand these 100% and read the textbook - you should do well. Massive curve where nearly half the class gets an A. | AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This guy has destroyed my GPA and self-esteem in one swoop. He does not teach in lecture but sends multiple long video lectures home the night before class and expects you to have mastered the material before class time. Exams are insane. He tests on things he said not to worry about and ignores everything he said to understand. | Hard material, great professor, and an amazing curve. Put in the effort and you're likely to get at least a B+. Lecture videos help a lot; I didn't even need to read the book. Do well on the quizzes, as they add up to one whole midterm exam grade. | I disagree with a lot of people here. He was a nice guy and a fair grader, but I really did not like the way that he explained concepts. He is very interesting to talk to (especially if you're into organic chemistry), but I found the way that he explained ideas to be convoluted and unnecessarily complex. Had to do a ton of self studying. | Great guy, 1010 for personality. This class is no joke though--to get an A in the class you need an solid 80+ average on tests (after normalization). He takes the time to learn everyones name which was quite impressive. Great guy, one of the best orgo classes at Rutgers, and overall if you put the work in, you can end with an A. | As long as you read the material and go to lecture, it's hard not to get at least a B+. Midterm exams are pretty hard, but the finals are easy. Definitely take this over 308. | He likes to teach for understanding. In a difficult subject like organic chemistry, he makes it even harder by expecting you to know WHY things happen instead of WHAT happens. Less memorization, more concepts. Therefore, half the class does poorly but everybody still gets an A. (Btw, he expects you to read the material before class) | Keeps you interested in the class by his witty remarks. Makes sure lectures are not boring. Real nice person, and approachable too. Answers questions worth answering. | Favorite professor of all time. Witty, helpful, passionate, approachable, and above all extremely knowledgable about his subject. I rarely attend non mandatory lectures, but he made ochem interesting and engaged the class well. Get to know him, truly an interesting guy. Oh and he'll really like you if you're a motivated student. | He's a really great professor. Orgo is a terrible class, but he tries to make it bearable. Read the book to stay on top of stuff. It takes a long time, but you'll be lost without it. I got a C in the class and studied more for it than I ever have for any class in my life, so you have to study a lot. But, if you want help,he's thereforyou. Great guy | very helpful and clear, made orgo barable | By far, the best teacher I've had in the science department at Rutgers. Organic Chemistry is obviously not easy, but he genuinely tries to help students understand. He's very intelligent, not only in chemistry, but in so many areas. One of my respected mentors. | Amazing, amazing, amazing. He actually TEACHES and tries to help students understand organic chemistry! Tests are representative of what is taught in class. Truly a great guy, too. | THE BEST PROFESSOR AT RUTGERS! Absolutely loved him! So so so helpful. has review sessions before every exam. He tells you what you should focus on, and his tests are very fair! Not only is he an amazing professor, but he is an incredible person. Definitely made orgo bearable. Going to miss him alot. | Williams is the most amazing professor! Really respects his students and understands HOW to teach! He's a sensitive, intelligent, and honest guy. Seriously, a privilege to have him as a professor. | Williams is the BEST! He is the best teacher in the chem department. He goes above and beyond to help students understand the material and is very dedicated. He's hilarious and a genuinely nice person. His exams are not easy but they are very straightforward and very fair. Go to class, his exams are based off the lecture notes. He's a great teacher | He's obviously a genius. My word of advice is don't ask him stupid questions. He will answer them with an explanation that goes over your head. Stick to asking him specific questions on the topic and he'll really help you out. He's really chill and very willing to help you out. | Great Professor! Very thorough, clear, organized and studious. Makes you want to do better! You almost look at him as a role model...like you want to become like him. Although a somehow shy and strange person, its worth getting to know a little bit of him.....point is, regardless of his personality, he always gets his point across. | I didn't have this guy but I wish I did. I realized my mistake when I went to one of his review sessions. He's a million times clearer than anyone else and he bought us Dunkin' Donughts, what a man! | This is the best orgo teacher at Rutgers. Not only is he hilarious, he does the best at making the horrible material easy to understand. If you want to actually pass the class, he's the best. | THe best orgo professor ever!!!! Funny, nice, clear, and helpful!"
"Hinch, Barbara","I have had her in person. She has her favs and will make it clear. I cannot imagine having her online asynch, but on zoom, it was not it. Dont even go to the dance department at all... | I had her for (nondance major/minor) Intro to Jazz Dance. So fun! Very encouraging and you can tell she loves what she does. Passionate about dance, and really cares for her students. Creates a great, fun, safe environment. So kind, really listens to her students. | Greatest waste of time, money, effort. Half of the class is just sorting through poorly organized info to get to the ONE paragraph you need to do the assignment. Grading was weird. Dance analysis is trivial; sorting through her resources is what made this difficult/ANNOYING. not an easy A | So if you don't analyze the dances and talk about them the way she sees them you're getting a 50. The class itself is just busy work for the most part, but the dance analysis stuff is graded way too harshly. Try your best, this class is an easy arts requirement class, a B shouldn't be too hard to get | I can not believe Rutgers even hired this disgrace of a teacher. I'm a senior and this is the worst class I could have taken. If your even thinking about taking her class, don't. She's a bad person and an even worse teacher. | This is by far the worst professor I've ever had. It is clear why she can only teach an online dance course because she is not smart enough to do anything else. Do not take. | Took class online over summer and it was an easy A. Although my grades started off around B+ range, she offered so much extra credit and constructive feed back that it was easy to bring them to an A+. That being said, if your really not comfortable with writing/critical thinking you may have a problem. | I took this class in order to get alleviate my tight schedule this semester. This course has to be one of by BIGGEST regrets of the semester. Ms. Angeline is a harsher grader and if you don't analyze dances in the way she sees it be ready to get almost half credit on the assignment. DONT TAKE THIS COURSE, it will hurt your GPA rather than help it. | It is just not what I expected. I expected it to be an easy A course like any other online GPA booster courses BUT it's not. Apparently you have to watch your grammar when writing reviews and really learn the materials to get a good grade. Maybe easy B but def. not easy A. I love musicals but the course material is not interesting."
"Hall, Gene","Even if you prepare lots for this class. The material on the exams are crazy hard and it will get tough. | There are 8 or 9 labs in this course. He gives you two weeks for them- and theoretically, you could finish them little by little and manage just fine. However, no one does that: get ready to throw away the whole entire day. Do NOT take this class with other labs. Exams are extremely difficult. Do not ever expect sympathy from Gene. | He's a nice guy, but grading criteria, while written doesn't make sense in that grades were only just released and there is no feedback for reports to argue scores. Exams include random material and random lecture references like down to what was worn. He expects a lot from students, but he doesnt provide resources to study from. Nice guy though. | Tough professor. Lot of work between pre-labs and lab reports, plus the exams were nearly impossible. For the first exam he gave us a review guide that contained about 60% of the exam material. The other 40% was random. The entire final was out of left field. But, he is a really nice person. Get to know him, and he'll get to know you | Having Dr. Hall for Chemistry Seminar is a real boon. He gives good feedback on your presentations. To get an A, show up for each class, make both of your presentations the correct time length, and remember to write 1 page about each of the two colloquia you attend. Stay off your phone during class, he's very particular about being respectful. | Dr. Hall is a nice guy, but the class can be a bit overwhelming at times, and he's the only one who teaches Instrumental Analysis. The labs require a LOT of work, as in 10-20 hours per lab report. He provides a report template for each lab that clearly shows what should be included, but sometimes they're missing requirements. Be ready to work hard! | Took this course twice. The first time was a total mess - unclear grading criteria, exams/labs not graded until the last week of classes, unfair test questions. This course has improved: the grading criteria is now clearly specified and stuff was graded/returned at a reasonable pace. The exams still contain questions on his class rants though. | I'd rather take this class with literally anyone else, but I guess no one else teaches it cause 348 is the Defense Against the Dark Arts of the chem department (except Hall is a lot less cool than Snape). Extremely vague instruction on labs and exams, never know what he wants and what to study. Lab reports take forever. Lectures useless. | Whatever you do, do not take a class with this man. I saw all these reviews and thought they were an exaggeration. They weren't. Did not receive a grade on any assignment until the last week of class. He lied to the class with vague instructions on exam, then graded with a vendetta. Grading is arbitrary and makes no sense. Mean for no reason. | Exams are hard and Prof Hall doesn't really take exam questions from the book. Do well on the lab reports, they will help save your grade. Unlike the previous years, a template for each lab report is created to guide you through the report. That helped a lot. Be prepared to give up a lot of time for this class if you want to pass. | WORST professor I have EVER had at Rutgers! You can study all the chapters from the book, all the Powerpoints, and all of the HW problems and his exams still come out of left field. He refuses to answer questions and takes forever to give back lab report grades. Unfortunately, he is the only prof who teaches this class.. THE WORST!!!!! | Seems like a nice enough guy out of class, but a terrible professor. Reads off of slides, is very vague, and doesn't even give you a clear answer when you ask him a question. Lab procedures have a lot of mistakes and the TA's take forever to give back things. | Only one that teaches course and is really bad at it. | He is a great guy and wants students to do well. Chemistry is still hard! | This prof and his TA's are unorganized. I agree with everything the last commenter said except I don't know anything about the racism part. They were very late getting the grades out, about weeks after the end of the semester. The average on the first exam was a 47. He doesn't curve and you don't get reports back. So glad the class is over | Here's all you need to know about his class. He didn't let TA'S give back grades at all during the semester, gives no partial credit and doesn't curve, three students asked about the status of their grades and he reported them for racism, and you'll spend at least 50 dollars out of pocket for this class. | I have never had classes with Gene, but I had the pleasure to work in his lab for a while as a summer intern (grad student). He is a very friendly guy, very helpful, he seemed excited just to help me do my analysis. So, dunno what the classes are like, but apart from that, he is a cool guy. | first off let me say that i am not a student who slacks in classes. I really tried my best to do well in this class but it was nearly impossible to do well in the class. He literally made question 10 times more confusing then they really should have been. I would not recommend taking this class with this professor!!! | he's a nice guy but he doesn't teach well..i did all the homework problems but they didn't really help me on the tests..theres no point in doing the practice tests because they are nothing like his real tests..i strictly followed the textbook but sometimes he wouldnt go by the textbook which was very annoying..his test questions are random ..hes a | Prof. Gene Hall should not be teaching! And if he continues, he should really reconsider how he teaches the class and make sure he write grades the questions CORRECTLY! because he doesn't... | his exams are supposedly ""real world problems"". most of the time this lecture is empty. you can find out why... puts up practice exams that are not even his, so you basically dont know how the exams are gonna be. stay away if you can.. | Read slides, impossible exams, no partial credit, no instruction on labs, lab procedures are outdated. and taught to addapt to the changing procedure. TAs just as bad | the absolute worst. i'm a transfer from chemE (where some of the most awful teachers are), and this guy sets the bar. from ambiguous lab instructions to pretentious lecturing, i have no respect for this man. | just reads his slides and goes off on tangents | The three negative comments are absolutely right. I never got an 11 on an exam before and he doesn't curve. It seems there is not partial credit for his written exams. Grader just gave a 0 if the answer was not correct. Too bad no one else is teaching. Gene knows his stuff though but he is too much into CSI forensics and the instruments. Becareful. | hes awsome :)) | he's a psycho... a selfish psycho... | Waste of time going to his lectures!!! He's NOT even willing to help when you beg for extra help regarding those extra-vague instruction for each experiment. He doesn't seem to have good communications with the TAs either because they are as clueless as the students. His class is crap! | he is a really nice guy but instumental analysis sucks! he doesn't lecture, he reads 115 slides to you and goes off on stupid tangents about CSI and crap like that. all this course teaches you is how to manipulate computer data... . good for computer scie"
"Shin, Yeunggyo","Super nice person, but NOT a good professor. Went to her lectures for the first month and the amount of students that attend her lectures exponentially decreases each time. You're much better off going to another professor or just keeping up and self-studying the content. | Honestly, a really good professor. The people who complain about her are the ones who simply did not go to the lecture. She does a lot of practice problems and explains them very well, and she's a really nice person overall. The only thing I would say is just look over the notes before class to get familiar with the basic material. | I had her for gen chem i & ii, it does not get better. Her lectures aren't concise or informative. She goes on a lot of tangents and is confusing when explaining / does not use the right terms. You're better off self-studying. She will also kick you out of recitation if you're more than 5 minutes late, no matter your circumstances. Do not take! | worst prof ever. dont take her, listen to the reviews | The professor is an overall nice person, but she is not the best lecturer. Her slides had little to no information compared to other professors. Would recommend a different professor for 161. | Is not capable of teaching at all. When she does, she lectures about something completely opposite of chem, the course you are taking. Senile, and I had to attend other lectures and study completely on my own to even get close to my final grade. It felt like I was taking a class without lectures. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE HER!!! | She is overall a very nice lady but my girl just cannot teach for her life. The course is very difficult and she does not teach to the level that the exams are made to. The midterms are so much harder than the final and the grade replacement they do at the end of the semester literally saved my grade. Take another professor if you're doing chem 1. | doesn't teach- annd if she does, it's more physics-based not chem which is what the exam is about"
"Emenike, Mary","Prof was very friendly and created an excellent classroom environment. She gives clear and concise rubrics, so it's hard to get a bad grade if you just take 2 minutes to glance over the rubric. I just skimmed over most of the assigned readings in the course, and still got a good grade. One of the best rutgers classes I've had so far!"
"Lee, Jeehiun","He's such a caring, sweet guy. I would definitely go to the lecture even though it not mandatory and go to his office hours if struggling. He genuinely wants to see you strive and succeed. | I had Jae Ki Lee as a TA for recitation. He is such as sweet guy and always made sure everyone understood the material before he moved on. When we have questions, he explains it super well. I actually learned more here than in actual lecture. Attendance is not mandatory, but you needed to show up to take the quizzes which were super easy. Take him!"
"Shi, Zheng","NA | You have to work for your desired grade. With that being said, it's completely doable if you attend lectures, pay attention, and practice. The cutoffs seems to be pretty forgiving, given that this is a difficult course. He was also accommodating and understanding. His expertise in biochemistry added an interesting spin to the course. | Hands down the worst professor Ive ever had. He doesnt care about the students not understanding things and treats it like its our fault we dont understand. Theres very few opportunities to fix your grade because more than 90% of your grade is assessments (3 exams and 10 quizzes). Would not recommend this class if you care about your GPA. | Genuinely the worst professor I've had to date. If you care at all about your gpa or your sanity BEWARE!!! | Without a doubt the worst classes that I've taken in my life. He makes little attempt to sympathizes with students and is incredibly stubborn towards suggested changes. Tests and quiz questions can be incredibly difficult compared to textbook homework problems. He has virtually no redeemable qualities. Avoid this professor like the plague. | If I could rate him a zero if I could because this is by far the worst class I have taken. He was overall very inconsiderate of our situations and never took criticism. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I spent most of my time teaching myself the content from the textbook. Tests were nothing like the practice or quizzes. Overall terrible experience. | he is the most condescending, arrogant, inconsiderate professor i've ever met. if you're struggling, he says to simply ""pay more attention"" during class. plus he never listens to constructive criticism. being in his class was mentally exhausting. don't take him if you want to save your gpa and sanity."
"Arnold, Edward","For chem, not a bad professor. A lot of work and strict in some respects on grading. Details matter. | He is very knowledgeable and smart. Three seminar writeups and two presentations is not much to do for an A, but make sure you know what you are presenting very well because he might ask in depth questions that blow your mind. He was not super picky about attendance but pays attention to who is showing up. | Pick a paper that you know and understand and you'll be fine. Be able to explain every single figure, chart, and table within the paper, and know what the big picture is and the class will be a breeze. I skipped a bunch of classes, but one day (while I was there), he randomly took attendance, so skip at your own risk. | Worst seminar prof at Rutgers. Avoid him at all costs. He is so rude. He criticizes the presentation in a non professional way and interrupts the presentation in a rude way to ask questions. He doesn't even have guidelines or even show us the right way to present. I don't know how he expects us to present properly when he has high expectations. | i dont think he teaches anything else, but he's really nice and helpful. and unlike other chem seminar profs, doesn't make you do an insane amount of work, pretty easy going and understanding. definitely worth the 9 am class."
"Halder, Jayati","She is really helpful, easy going, focuses on what you need to know. She also answers questions very nicely and is very clear with her teaching style."
"Muniz, Marc","Has a degree in BOTH chemistry and teaching. Genuinely cares about students' success and will even check in with his former students who go on to complete the honors 163-164 sequence. | Probably the best professor I've had all semester. Extremely passionate about teaching and chemistry. Please take advantage of all the help he offers and his accessibility. Chemistry is a hard subject, but Dr. Muniz tries everything he can to make it easier for his students to understand. If you study and do practice problems, you will succeed. | Chem is difficult but Prof Muniz makes it much easier. He is happy to answer any questions thoroughly and is passionate about teaching. His lectures are very good and he appropriately prepares you for any exams. You do have to watch the lectures before class, but class is fully spent on activities to make sure you understand the material. | Online lectures explain the concepts exceptionally well - pay attention and internalize them, and you will do good on his quizzes/exams. Clearly cares for his students, occasionally providing retakes for quizzes. Dropped the lowest 3 (instead of 1) quizzes for our class, and made the open-ended section of the final take-home. | Muniz clearly cares heavily about his students and their performance, and will work with you to maximize your grade and knowledge gained. This is a flipped classroom structure, so be prepared to spend multiple hours a week watching lectures outside of class, and then doing group-work practice problems during classtime. Exams very similar to genchem | His class is flipped, so you will have to watch his lecture video before class time (~1 hr each). He gives practice tests and does Zoom reviews before each exam (3 midterms and a final). Each week, there are 2 quizzes, 10 homework problems, and a couple of activity sets you must complete. This course requires a lot of work, but an A is achievable. | Muniz is actually such a sweet professor! He knows what he's teaching and has a lot of knowledge about the course. The exams can be tricky, but there's always a chance to be able to get your grade back up, and as long as you really watch the lecture videos and pay attention, you'll definitely pass! | Great teacher. Really cares about the success of students in his class. Makes sure you understand and if you don't, meeting with him really helps. Overall, passionate about the subject and cares about his students. | Very good and caring guy, will really try hard to manipulate your grade so you do better. He ended up removing 3 quizzes instead of 1 as stated in the syllabus so everyone would end with a better grade. Posts a lot of study and review material and really loves teaching and wants to see students succeed | he is an amazing professor. i emailed him hundreds of times and received prompt, detailed responses! his lectures are long but helpful, so utilize them!he wants all of his students to do well and offers ways to make up poor scores. exams are very hard BUT he offers ways to make up the grade AS LONG AS you put in the work | Super super understanding professor and absolutely always wants his students to do the best that they can. The class itself is really hard and the quizzes are hard, so make sure you study a lot and do all the practice problems he gives you. | To me, it is pretty clear that Professor Muniz wishes for the success of his students. If any student ever had a question about the material, they could always reach him whether it was through office hours or simply speaking to him after class. The clas | I hated chem except for the semester that he taught me. So passionate about student learning, takes his time to explain things in class and one-on-one. | Professor Muniz is amazing! Keep in good contact with him and he will make sure you understand the thing that isn't quite clicking yet. The midterms and finals are not crazy weighted where if you do bad on one, you are screwed. He is truly amazing! | KING!!!!!! | Absolutely amazing chemistry professor who seems very passionate. Although the lectures can be a bit drawn out, they're explained really well and go in enough depth for the content to make sense. He is very friendly and accessible, and he is open to answering any questions you have for him. HW assignments are very helpful (unlimited attempts) | Professor Muniz is one of the best lecturers that I've had so far in my time here at Rutgers. He is very clear in what he is teaching, he really cares about his student's success, and he gives an insane amount of practice (optional) in order for his students to really master the content. Take him if you see his name! | I could write a book about Professor Muniz. He is definitely the best professor I have ever had. He is always available to help and really wants you to know the content. Although this is the hardest class I have ever taken, I think having him as a professor definitely helped me enjoy the class. I would definitely recommend him 100%. | Marc is a great professor, he's super passionate and gives a ton of resources/chances for students to improve their grades. But this is in part because the content is most definitely harder. Be prepared to read/study a lot, and personally I would be cautious if you didn't take AP Chem before. Otherwise, his class is great (especially as orgo prep) | many opportunities to bring grades up. very accessible, good office hours and will answer all questions clearly. only took honors chem bc he teaches it. grades based on 3 midterms, final, weekly quizzes, online homework (unlimited attempts), and group project (guaranteed 100 btw). def review content regularly and use practice exam | Prof. Muniz is a great guy but his Honors Chem course was the hardest course I have taken thus far. He is good at lectures but his quizzes and tests contain items that were barely touched upon. If you are good at spending chunks of time studying outside of class then go for it, if not please consider elsewhere. | A professor that actually wants you to pass. Had a concern with grading criteria towards the end of the semester, but it was because he was worried not enough students would get good grades, so he made it easier. Extends deadlines very often and definitely listens + answers + is very available. | I love Muniz. His grading system is very lenient and helpful to boost your chances in getting an A. He's also just a downright amazing professor; really cares for his students, and if you actually go to his office hours/practice sessions, you will do well. Midterms are always rough, but the final is a blessing! Enjoy honors chem:) | One of the best professors ever! He really cares about his students and tries to help them in any way. He teaches the material very clearly and understandably, and he is very open to provide extra help in any way he can. Every student I have talked to has loved this professor and I've never heard a single complaint. | A great person and great professor. Teaching chemistry is no easy task, let alone learning it. You will experience difficulty in this course since exams are extremely difficult. But, Marc meets you halfway by doing literally everything in his power to help his students build a solid foundation. | He truly cares and goes to every extent to make sure all of us are doing amazing. Unlike many other profs he really emphasizes learning/ understanding the topic and he does everything he can to get you there. Absolute best professor I've EVER had. Wish I could have him every year. | Literally the most caring and smartest chemistry professor ever. | Professor Muñiz is HANDS DOWN the best professor I've ever had. He cares a lot about his students, and listens to our concerns about specific assignments. Beware, however, as his class is not easy and you really be ready to do the work. Luckily, if you attend his office hours, do all of the homework, and study, you'll do well. | Literally the best professor I've had so far. I came into this class with little to no chemistry experience but he made everything easy to understand. The tests are pretty difficult especially if you do not use the material he gives you. But overall if you practice you should do well. He tries his best to make this class as interesting as possible! | He is one of the best instructors I have ever had. I've always sucked at chemistry, but Professor Muniz's practice materials helped me out a lot. Take advantage of benchmarks, look over previous exams, and read the textbook to be successful. Exams are hard, but there are plenty of ways to improve your grade if you do badly on them. | He is a great professor: he listens to students' concerns, replies to messages outside of class, and tries his best to make exams more helpful towards your grade while maintaining the difficulty for the course. I had issues in this class due to the material, but Muniz's office hours, willingness to answer questions, and reading the textbook helped. | Professor Muñiz is one of the best professors I've ever had. He explains things in a way that really makes you understand, and if you don't, he's more than willing to make time to help you out. Recitations, practice questions, and benchmarks are super helpful in this class. The key takeaway: PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. Oh, and practice. | Muñiz is a blessing. He really cares about you. You can retake quizzes for partial credit sometimes. His office hours are helpful and he's easy to talk to. The material is tough but he explains it well and doesn't mind repeating himself if you ask. Add him to your groupme! He's reasonable about due dates. Extra credit is an option. Best prof ever! | GO TO MARC'S OFFICE HOURS. HE IS A CHEM GOD PROFESSOR THAT IS ACTUALLY NICE AND CARING AND APPROACHABLE. Ask anyone and they will tell you he is the best. | amazing amazing amazing. Go to his office hours. He is the best professor I have ever met in my whole life. Truly cares for all students. He's the reason I did well in chem. The other actual gen chem professors are not NEARLY as good as him. | He explains complex topics well and his office hours are amazing. He is a very down to earth guy and you can just tell he loves chemistry and teaching. There was a really hard question on the final and I got it right only because he showed us how to do a similar one in office hours. He knows what its like to be a student so get him for ALR. | Took Chemistry 161 and went to Marc's office hours as a supplement. SUPER helpful. If you feel that you struggle in chemistry, do not hesitate to go to Marc's office hours. He is ready to sit down with you and answer every question. Simplified topics very well. I don't what I'm going to do in orgo chem without him"
"Slomko, Danielle","I'm not into science, but this class made me realize how awesome food science is | She made the class fun and interactive! | loved her"
"Le, Kim-Phuong","She is very patient and does her best to break down concepts/explain as much of the course as possible in the limited time she has during lectures. Everyone flooded her office hours since she explained things very well. However, this is Orgo; you have to do a lot of work on your own to keep pace with the course. | Not the best at lecturing but excells in the small classroom halls. Goes out of her way to make herself accessible and gave her very best to help us pass. Organic is a difficult course but if you go to her office hours, read the textbook before class and do the homework, you'll see worthwhile results | KPL is really sweet; her lectures aren't that useful but she is FANTASTIC in office hours so go to those when you can. Orgo as a whole is very difficult, and you will have to self-study most of it anyway. Just remain present and learn from your mistakes. If it makes you guys feel better I got a 30 on exam 2 and still got an A #clutchedup | Sweetest women you will ever meet but skips slides in lecture and does not show many examples. To study rely on the textbook and youtube videos. | Nothing made sense in this class. Instead of reading off the slides every lecture maybe physically teach us by drawing. Coordinator wasn't good at replying to emails. Textbook barely had any practice problems. When it came to problems to prepare us for all 3 regular exams only the 2020 version was provided like how is that going to help us. | Worst class I had to deal with ever. She was ok wouldn't say the best professor to teach this course. All she did was read slides with a low tone. The coordinator barely answered any of her emails and the professor kept telling us ask her for more practice problems when nothing was provided. Overall this department needs to do better. | KPL is really sweet but for things that should take 5 min to explain it takes her an hour and 15 convoluted slides. better off using Leah4Sci and Chad's Prep to understand material and the textbook problems for practice. somehow, she is a better explainer during recitation so aim to get her for that, esp since exams are now harder than past years | She's really really nice, but her lectures are SO hard to follow. The slides are good, but you can't understand a word she says. The only grades in the entire course are for the exams, they're the only things that count, so study good for them. She definitely is always willing to answer questions, but good luck understanding her answer. | She's really really nice but her lectures are SO hard to follow. The slides themselves are good but you can't really understand a word she says. The only grades in the entire course are for the exams so theyre the only things that count. She definitely is always willing to answer questions but good luck understanding her answer. | Her lectures can be hard to understand and follow, but she makes up for it because she is extremely nice and is always willing to help students and answer questions both in class and outside of class. Orgo is tough, but if you attend all lectures and recitations, do textbook problems, and study even JUST A LITTLE EVERY DAY, you will get an A. | Dr. Le makes the pain of learning organic chemistry much easier. Her lectures are super engaging and she even gives breaks to give students a moment of peace in the chaos. Not many people show up to her lectures but I think it is worth it to ask questions on the material."
"Cullerton, Denise","Prof Cullerton is better than the professors who actually teach orgo. She gives great ways to remember things and actually cares about her students doing well. | Denise is the best part of the Organic Chemistry department. She is incredibly helpful and does whatever she can to help students succeed. Her recitations are very helpful and she teaches better than the professors. The clicker quizzes aren't difficult, and she spends most of the time doing practice problems and giving tips to remember things. | Denise Cullerton was about the only person in organic chemistry besides one of the three professors and TIs who actually tried to help students learn/understand organic chemistry. This course is absurdly structured and graded. Denise was a great recitation instructor who really helped as far as test prep. I had her for regular recitation not ALR. | She is an amazing recitation professor who truly knows how to teach. Her slides are good and her office hours are super helpful! She is one of the main reasons I survived through orgo 1 and 2. | She knows what she is doing. May be she teaches high school better for the amount of energy that she has, but she made orgo fairly understandable for us. Wonderful slides. Very helpful and relevant office hours. | DENISE IS LIFE. I looked forward to recitation every week because I knew any question I had Denise would answer it. She stayed Thursday nights until 11 PM answering questions and helping students out even though her recitation ended at 9:20. She not only made orgo less painful but she actually gave me motivation and drive to do well. | Her and Christine are the best Orgo professors for getting help outside of class. I am happy she is the recitation professor because helps more than the three actual lecturers. Go to her office hours she is personable and an amazing professor. | Even though I didn't do well in the class, Denise made the class that much more enjoyable. She was funny, personable and made the material clear. I honestly wish she was one of the lecturers. | incredibly sweet woman. she genuinely wishes to see everyone do well. she will go FAR out of her way just to help you. her quizzes are tough, but its better that you see it in recitation than on an actual exam. she makes orgo VERY approachable. great person as well. | Denise has taught high school chemistry, she taught in Sandy Hook Connecticut, she teaches gen chem at RVCC and is the assistant professor for orgo and does the recitations. (I wish she was one of the part time lecturers!!) She's so approachable and shows the chemistry in an easy way that students can understand. SOO NICE I absolutely love her!! | OMG! Denise is such a blessing. She explains really well and makes orgo easier. Love her! | She is great! She actually taught high school before and I feel like she can explain orgo in a way that makes so much sense. She's so easy to talk to and just an amazing person, definitely go to her office hours and get help from my girl Denise!! | Bright and funny."
"Dismukes, Gerard","Probably the least understanding person ever. During lecture, he only talked in terms that graduate level students would understand. Barely answered any questions or answered question in terms that undergraduate students would not have learned yet. For a 1.5 credit class, it was extremely difficult. | Unfortunately, this professor is extremely rude and cannot explain any material competently, everyone is always confused. He is heartless about medical conditions, even though we're in a global pandemic. It's a disaster of a class, especially since the course is hard in the first place. Please avoid if you can. | He is an abysmal instructor, tough grader, expects enormous amounts of outside work for a 1.5 credit course. Disorganized, poor proctoring (he once gave a quiz with all the answers preselected), and rude to people who ask questions. So basically, one of the better professors of the chem department! | The fact that he only holds 1 hour of office hours a week just shows how much he does not care about you. He also never answers your question directly and will instead ramble with as many fancy terms as possible for 20 minutes around your question. He's either too smart to teach or he forgot how undergrad classes work; I lean towards the latter. | Has difficulty explaining concepts, and his answers to questions confuses everyone due to that. To compound the problem, instead of utilizing class time to reinforce important points, he chooses the time to go over additional material. Studying is moot, as quizzes and exams are extrapolated from material, rather than based on them. Avoid."
"Asefa, Tewodros","He is passionate about what he does, thus he cares very much about students. He skips through many slides because there is too much to be covered. exams are harder than you think, so take notes at lecture. Curve was 5+ points , but still easy to fall bellow A or B+. | First off, I learned more about chemical bonds/bonding in the physics class I was taking than this ridic course. Having both purchased/read the book & previously taken E&M, I found his explanation of certain concepts directly contradicted literature. His grading scale is based on highest/lowest scores in class so do better than the ppl around you. | You must go to class. Don't take it lightly. I saw these reviews and thought it was going to be a piece of cake. It's not. 1 midterm, 1 final. Pop quizzes whenever he sees attendance drop. Study and you'll be fine. But don't underestimate it. | Professor Asefa is definitely the greatest chem professor at rutgers! would definitely recommend this class. He gives two midterms, and two very easy extra credit quizzes. He also curves the exams. You actually learn chemistry and don't have to worry too much about your grade in this class. he also responds very quickly to all emails. | He's the best inorganic professor we have in the department. Take classes with him. Down side is he moves through material really fast but he simplifies everything to a super easy level to understand. Nothing insanely difficult about his exams either except that there's a lot. He has an awesome Ethiopian accent and his office hours are very helpful | had him for chem bonding and inorganic, highlyy recommended. exams were either really easy or really hard but his curve is VERY good. one of the better profs in the chem dept. has the coolest accent ever, but isnt too hard to understand. he is definitely a very smart man. | Definitely the professor to take Chem Bonding with. Class is fairly simple (lot of Gen Chem material) and as long as you go to class you should be fine. He has an accent but he's certainly comprehensible and unlike a lot of Chem profs, he doesnt bore you to sleep immediately. | good"
"Greenblatt, Martha","The professor forgot to submit my exam for disability accommodations for a month and then tried to fail me when I ""didn't take the exam."" Also, this professor refused to make a makeup exam for me when I had a medical excuse and then said she would average my grade from my two scores from the first and final exams. F b/c of her laziness. | She says she will bump up your grade because ""attendance matters"" but she did not do so. So if you think you should go to lectures, think again. During lectures, she forgets what she went over and what she did not, so sometimes she skips complete lectures and other times she reteaches the same thing for two lectures. Overall, self study. | She only reads from the slides, and does not help with anything.If you want to pass the class please do yourself a favor and take another professor. | Dont understand all the hate. She expects a lot from her class. She wont mind failing you, which is understandable since half the class doesnt show to lecture or doesnt pay attention. She has pretty good lecture notes that are all uploaded in advance, and the exams are straightforward. Learned a lot in this class, would recommend if you enjoy chem | Very boring lady, should get fired. Only took class for a week and can already tell the reviews are true. Beware and avoid if possible | She is really mean. she would get mad when students try to ask her questions. she hands back exams from the highest grade to the lowest which is really bad in my opinion. Her lecture notes are really bad and not clear and she doesn't know how to explain. if you had another choices, def don't take this class with her | She is not good at explaining things. Her notes sometimes have errors in them. The textbook has errors in it. The solutions manual has errors in it. On top of all this, the course material is difficult. Averages are low 60's, but she only curves to B+. You need 90 or more for an A. Take this class with the other professor, who is easier I've heard. | This woman really sucks at teaching. I attended every class, and she managed to confuse the entire class every time. Only one person gets an A. She's not clear and should consider retirement. | I don't understand the negative comments here. Dr. Greenblatt provided lecture notes prior to classes, and derived her questions from them on her exams. The book is not very useful, but her old exams and examples in notes give you an idea of what she thinks is important. Her notes have some mistakes and aren't always formatted the best; I liked her | Has no interest in teaching only wants to do research. Is not a nice person at all. Would research other options other than her as a teacher | Tenure or not this prof. needs to retire. She ha no interest in her student or the class. Was nasty, mean person. Hands test back in order of how good you do. Tells you there are no chemist in the class.Research is her only (POSS>) skill. Beware, think twice about HER | This Professor is hard as hell. She's there just to fail you. Extremely unfriendly. Her personalities are worse than her teaching"
"Li, Jing","She is a nice lady but her teaching style is really trashy. Heavy reading and heavy lectures and discussion is usually boring. Midterm and final are nothing from what's being lecture in class. Don't take her if u want to learn. | she's awful!! and whoever thought she was hot is just ludicrous. the class isn't as interesting as it sounds and there's A LOT of reading. her grading system is whack. | no one is telling it as it is, so heres the rundown 1)Massive amount of reading (must be kept up with) 2)1 Essay (pretty difficult to obtain an A 3)take home mid-term (94 is a B+, so don't even think about making any mistakes) 4)Final (with a significant amount of not in text info) 5)grading w/ minuses + ambigious standard | Largely discussion based, but it might be better not to let some students talk so much. Office hours work much better. Teacher knows a lot. Scary at first, but merciful at end. Class needs to be smaller. | She is an easy teacher. Class is based on discussion and midterm/final are a joke. Don't let her intimidate you. Let that harvard grad know her role | Large class, but professor holds it together with interesting questions. Lots of room for discussion about complicated texts. Cool reeadings. A lot of work. I think the professor's cute. | Well the midterm is take home....that's about the only good thing about this class...the prof assigns a ridiculous amount of reading. Class discussions on the material is either too abstract to follow or just plain irrevalent. The prof's wardrobe is also a scary sight to behold. | Professor is really intelligent, unfortunately she isn't a good teacher. Class is based on in class discussion of readings with few notes, just about everything is left up in the air and varies with interpretation. There really are no concrete answers, yet the midterm and final address specific issues from the immense amount of reading material... | took hist, lit, pop cult of china. lots of reading (on avg 4hrs/wk), good lectures- really interesting but MUST do reading beforehand. not many grades- only 1 paper, take home midterm, final."
"Waldie, Kate","I took the honors section with Dr. Waldie, and I really learned a lot! She was super organized in the course in general, and she always paid attention to the class' progress (ex. she gave us a few extra minutes during difficult quizzes, etc). Her exams were challenging although she graded them thoroughly and gave partial credit for work shown. | (Honors Section)Dr. Waldie was the best professor I've ever had. Not only was she extremely nice, but a very fair grader. Although the class was difficult at times and we had a lot of video assignment, Dr. Waldie gave a lot of practice problems and enough information to complete the quizzes with accuracy. Just make sure to stay on top of your work!"
"Ebright, Richard","Amazing professor. Had him for physical chem 2. His tests were very fair. If you show up to every lecture and stay on top of the work, its not hard to get an A. You will struggle if you try to cram."
"Lipke, Mark","I think he's a pretty fair grader, the material is naturally hard so you need to read the textbooks and do all the questions he assigns. He explains everything insanely well so go to office hours if you're confused. His lecture slides can be kind of vague but his lectures are good. Probably the best professor in the chem department!!! | Great professor, really passionate about the material and specifically doing a good job at teaching the material. Is always ready to help, in -class and out of class. Definitely take advantage of office hours, show that you're working hard. The material is naturally difficult. Read the textbook before class, ask questions, put in the time. | Dr. Lipke tried very hard to be interactive during lectures, the format of the class made it a bit harder to get everyone involved but he still did a good job. You definitely need to keep up with readings in this class, he covers everything in his lectures but the content is difficult and you need the reinforcement. He cares and it shows. | Dr. Lipke is a nice Prof. But such a hard grader! He is always ready to explain and help students during his office hrs. Inorgo itself is very hard , have to read book and put so much extra efforts to learn material. HW probs helps but exam questions are difficult and need lots of understanding to solve. No partial credit! 5 points MCQ- Horrible | He is a great professor. Inorganic itself is a tough subject. Lipke puts in a lot of time into making his lectures, and his exam questions come from material that is covered between his lecture and the homework. I would highly suggest reading the book in order to get a deeper understanding of the material. Relying solely on the lecture notes bad | Very hard class ! He is a tough grader!"
Remsing Richard,"Amazing professor. Had him for physical chem 2. His tests were very fair. If you show up to every lecture and stay on top of the work, its not hard to get an A. You will struggle if you try to cram."
"Shin, Yeung-Gyo","Super nice person, but NOT a good professor. Went to her lectures for the first month and the amount of students that attend her lectures exponentially decreases each time. You're much better off going to another professor or just keeping up and self-studying the content. | Honestly, a really good professor. The people who complain about her are the ones who simply did not go to the lecture. She does a lot of practice problems and explains them very well, and she's a really nice person overall. The only thing I would say is just look over the notes before class to get familiar with the basic material. | I had her for gen chem i & ii, it does not get better. Her lectures aren't concise or informative. She goes on a lot of tangents and is confusing when explaining / does not use the right terms. You're better off self-studying. She will also kick you out of recitation if you're more than 5 minutes late, no matter your circumstances. Do not take! | worst prof ever. dont take her, listen to the reviews | The professor is an overall nice person, but she is not the best lecturer. Her slides had little to no information compared to other professors. Would recommend a different professor for 161. | Is not capable of teaching at all. When she does, she lectures about something completely opposite of chem, the course you are taking. Senile, and I had to attend other lectures and study completely on my own to even get close to my final grade. It felt like I was taking a class without lectures. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE HER!!! | She is overall a very nice lady but my girl just cannot teach for her life. The course is very difficult and she does not teach to the level that the exams are made to. The midterms are so much harder than the final and the grade replacement they do at the end of the semester literally saved my grade. Take another professor if you're doing chem 1. | doesn't teach- annd if she does, it's more physics-based not chem which is what the exam is about"
"Vargas, Cecilia","Math is difficult for me but Prof Arias was very understanding and supportive and went above and beyond to help me. She never gave up on me. She is one of the kindest professors I've ever had. Prof Arias cares deeply about her students and you feel it and know it. I'd take her again in a heartbeat. | Out of all my years of school, I can honestly say that I've maybe had 2 or 3 other teachers or professors that even hold a candle to how amazing Professor Arias is. She genuinely cares so much about her students succeeding and the way that she is willing to go above and beyond for her students is truly extraordinary. Best professor ever. | Best math professor, could not reccommend more. SO kind and caring, helps during exams, extends office hours to help, give extensions on homework and quizzes, lets you work together during quizzes, always accesible and extremely helpful through email. She is the reason I passed math this sem and I am forever grateful. 100000/10 teacher truly a gem | She's really good at teaching math, especially for someone like me who's not good at math. She's also a caring professor and is always willing to help her students. | I love Professor Arias so much! She was so sweet and caring and genuinely wanted all her students to succeed in the class. We just went over homework every class, had partner quizzes, and a few in-person exams. I'm not a math person but she made learning so fun and easy. Definitiely recommend taking a class with her. | Had her for Math112 recitation. Nicest Professor I have ever had. Very caring and will go above and beyond to explain something you may not understand. Gives partial credit, grades fair. She wants everyone to succeed. | Dr. Arias is awesome! She's honestly one of the best communicating professors there is and she makes herself available whenever you need to ask questions about the material. She tries her best to adapt to your way of learning so you better understand the material so don't be afraid to ask for help! | took the preofessor arias this fall. very difficult class and no extra credit | Easy GPA boosting class. | Good professor who explains the material clearly | Best professor at Rutgers, and she's actually knows what she's doing and is great at teaching. Always willing to help, responds fast and gives good feedback. Took this class from 9 -10:40 pm and it was worth it. Gives partial/extra credit on exams. Go to class, pay attention, and ask questions. Actually made me want to learn and was so supportive. | OMG Prof. Arias is motherrr!! I admit that I failed the first exam. So for the rest of the semester, I made sure to ask for help during class. You could ask for her help 10x during class and she will gladly answer your questions. She makes her exams straightforward. It's not meant to trip you up unlike the math department homework sheet. | I absolutely love prof Arias...she is one of the nicest professors I've had. You work with partners which is really helpful...tests are open notes. She actually wants her students to do well and get a good grade. Friends had other profs for this class and hated it...if you can take her do it! Def take 103 to fulfill your SAS requirement | Such a nice lady. Take her if your hesitant. | Love her! One downfall I had was that she didn't teach the material herself, and had us watch canvas lectures on our own, which I wasn't a huge fan of. However, she is always there when you have a question. I SUCK at math and did pretty well. Def a great class and prof to meet ur SAS requirements. | Took a hybrid version of math 103 with her during the Fall 2021 semester. I would definitely recommend this class with her if you are trying to fulfill your SAS core math requirement. It's pretty easy, the homework can take a while sometimes but it's not hard and all the exams were open note. She's super nice and helpful. | Amazing professor. Just do her work and you'll pass the class. her exams and quizzes are open notes. She also assigns an extra credit project which helps immensely. She's understanding and loves to help her students. | Prof. Arias was an awesome instructor! Take her if you ever get the chance, especially for math 103 or 106 which can be a bit confusing. She also has great taste in music and is always smiling. | I love Prof Arias so much. This semester she let me do my homework in office hours so I could check my work with her, and I've never done so well in a math class before. She's really sweet and helpful, and the kind of teacher that believes in you so much you try harder just to not let her down. I wish she taught more classes I could take. | I cannot express how amazing Dr. Arias is!! She is so friendly & genuinely cares so much about her students. She devotes so much time to helping students and makes office hours really accessible. Even though I took this class online, she made it a really nice interactive environment. Seriously my favorite professor I've ever had! | Such an awesome prof. She seems to really care about her students and really wants them to just pass. She does an awesome job explaining the concepts and the work load is definitely manageable. Records lectures and posts notes. She replies relatively quickly to emails and is also super trendy. | Professor Arias shows a lot of care towards her students and will always help figure out problems in the homework or class questions by allocating time in the beginning of class or after class. She assigns a short quiz every Thursday and a homework once a week which is very manageable and helps you practice in preparation for the 3 exams. | Cecilia is a very caring professor who helps everyone shine to their full potential. It's an easy course and she most certainly makes it enjoyable. However, do not buy the textbook, it's useless! Take her though! | Cecilia is the G.O.A.T. She is a must have professor who will stop at nothing to get you an A. She is very caring, her work is easy though there is a weekly quiz where you can work in a group to complete. Exams are decently challenging, but our second exam she let us do test corrections and gave us more credit on that one. Overall Awesome Prof! | Extremely nice professor, for an extremely easy class. She gives a decent amount of homework, but it does help on the test. She gives a quiz at the end of every week, but allows it to be done with a partner. She will give you hints on exams if you ask. Will help with quizzes as well. Drops 3 lowest homework grades and 2 lowest quiz grades. | The class had eleven people so if you skip its noticeable but she doesn't take attendance. The material is super dry and she isn't the best at making it much more exciting, but she brings in snacks to work with sometimes so that was cool. I expected to learn how to teach algebra but I didn't. She is super flexible around what students need/can do | Amazing wonderful angel. Im TERRIBLE at math and I still have a high A in the class. Makes sure EVERYONE fully understands the material before moving on. Group quizzes weekly are super easy and even fun. Offers help with weekly hw assignments too. Drops the lowest 2 hw and lowest 2 quiz grades. Super nice, helpful and REALLY wants us to succeed. | She was really easy to reach outside of class. Theres also lots of grades like weekly homework and quizzes. It is not too bad though material wise. The quizzes were also fairly easy as long as you look over the material. | Professor Arias really cares about her students and it shows. If you ever need additional help, she is almost always accessible via email or office hours. The material was not too bad either. Only exam exams and weekly homework assignments. The assignments were long but the exams were not too bad. | She was my recitation instructor and she would give super easy quizzes (which definitely helps your grade in that class). She was nice, but she also did the questions different than the professor so it got SUPER confusing sometimes because I often couldn't put two and two together as to what was happening. | She was an overall good professor, however the last section of material on growth and finance was difficult and rushed. We did not have time to review much for the final, which ends up being much more difficult than the other exams. However despite this, I still would take her again. Weekly quizzes, three exams and weekly homework assignments. | Fantastic TA. Clarifies anything the professor has not properly explained during class. 2-3 question quizzes at the end of each recitation are collaborative and often have verbatim problems that we've already covered. | She's super great | Amazing professor! Cares about her students, great at clarifying any questions students have. Extremely helpful in office hours as well. If you have a decent math background this class should be vey easy as long as you do the hw problems. | Professor Arias is the best math professor I have ever had in my entire life. She loves what she does, she goes above and beyond for her students whenever they do not understand a concept. She is very understanding when it comes to having a personal emergency. Cant say one bad thing about her. shes so great it inspires you to do well! | Kindest professor I've had at Rutgers. Had her for math for the liberal arts and mathematics of money. Understanding, accommodating and super sweet. Exams are easy and she understands that we are non-math majors. | Sweetest professor ever!! One of the nicest professors I've had. | Great class, easy, fair grader, we go over practice problems during class. You go to class and learn how to do the problem then do a short homework once a week that takes 5 minutes. The tests are exactly like the homework and she is an easy grader, giving points everywhere she can. Attendance isnt really mandatory or non-mandatory I just go."
"Bandyopadhyay, Rajoshree","Quizzes and exams were helpful | Nice professor. Quizzes almost every week. As long as you go over thoroughly problems done in class you will be good for exam & she gives a mock exam. She does sometimes make mistakes. | its basically highschool chem. Great professor, quizzes were kinda annoying, but not a difficult class. | bandy is the best chem professor for chem 106 and 120! she is literally the best and helps you out so much! Bandy & catalano are the only chem professors that are good in the chem department! | Doesn't give enough practice homework, so you slip up easily on tests if you do not understand 101% | As someone who didn't have a chance to take chemistry in high school due to the pandemic lockdown, I really appreciated taking this class and having professor Bandy. At first chemistry used to scare me because I thought it was too complicated, but this introductory course really opened up my eyes and it was not that bad. I'd reccomend this class. | barely explains anything, and she gets annoyed at questions. I had to teach myself everything!!! | She was a great help. Will help you if you show you care about the class and about ur grade. A bit passive-aggressive at times, but overall very good professor. She's very good at explaining things and making sure you understand, and actually cares about her job. | She is not the best teacher at all | Literally amazing. Lectures are so clear, she teaches everything in depth and will go over it again if u need. accessible outside of class and actually cares about students and always alerts u of quizzes/exams. take her if you want to actually understand the material and be confident with it. 10/10 would recommend | I took her course during the summer bridge, and would recommend, 10 out of 10. She thoroughly goes through everything. if you have any questions about previous quizzes or exams, she will answer them. Totally recommend her. | She is the worse teacher ever. She has a big attitude. Cannot stand her. | Professor Bandy was incredibly accessible outside of class. She was very good at explaining the material. She curves grades based on your effort in her class. | Dr. Bandy is one of the best Chemistry instructors at Montclair State. Her teaching style is very straightforward and she never tries to trick you on exams. She is very pleasant during office hours and will help you with anything. There are quizzes, but they help. Just ask questions, read the book, put the effort in and you will be fine! Good luck! | I would recommend Prof Bandyopadhyay if you are retaking or trying to understand Chemistry better. She cares for her students to be better and is always available outside of class. Chemistry is not easy but prof Bandy really made me understand chemistry a lot better. | Go to every single lecture and recitation class! She covers a lot in class, but only easy stuff. 3 exams and a final, make sure you study everything! Exams based off of class problems, but harder. Taking good notes, paying attention, and most importantly going to recitation, will give you an A. Makes mistakes, so make sure understand material. | Chem is already a hard course, but she is understanding and wants you to pass! She is a nice professor, just follow up during recitations and office hours. You should be fine. | I recently finished the semester with taking professor Bandyopadhyay, and my advice is that you should go to the lectures to really understand the material. The first part of the semester covers the ""easier"" material, torwards the end it gets much harder. Pay attention, do practice problems, go to extra help and you'll be fine! She's really nice. | Bandy is a good professor but don't skip lecture because that's where the majority of content for the class is covered. She cares about her students just make sure you communicate with her and go to office hours if you're falling behind. She's fair with grading and overall made chem 120 a pleasant experience | I had her my first semester as an undergraduate and I do recommend her. She actually teaches and gives you practice problems in class. She is also caring and helps out in her office hours, she makes sure you understand. I was not doing well in the beginning but I kept getting better in each exam and at the end she gave me an A (she curves). | Great professor but tests are difficult. Tests do include topics we did not go over too much in lecture but is very reasonable with grading. She even goes to labs which most professor do not do. and she is always available for office hours or reviews. 4 exams, quizzes. not much homework. Hardest thing is the exams. | She is a really nice person but good at explaining the content. Since the class is test-heavy as a student you have to rely on the reviews and content but the exams never match up with the reviews. There is hardly any homework so if you are bad at taking tests then she is not the professor for you. Chemistry is hard but somehow she makes it harder. | My experience with Professor Bandy was good! I definitely recommend taking her class. Even though attendance is not mandatory, you won't pass if you skip. She really makes sure you understand the material well. There's weekly quizzes based on the section she goes over. Her exams are mid, as long as you study and practice the materials given to you! | Chemistry is hard by itself but Professor Bandy made it pretty easy for me. Sit in the front of the class even if you don't like to, it really made me pay attention and pass. Pay attention in class and take detailed notes. She gives quizzes every week. No homework which is awesome. She's a nice professor you just have to really show that you care!! | She was very helpful for office hours. But when it came to daily class, we went over e sections a day. For work, there really wasnt any. She told us to pay for Clutchprep (which was like $30) and then she never spoke about it again. All she said was that there practice. Which is just multiple choose and old videos. She has an additude too | Loved her class and the way she teaches, no other chem professor like her. Seriously take her you wont regret it!! | Very helpful professor and is always available for help. | My experience with Professor B was average! Her switch from in person lectures to online was a bit rocky but she still managed to teach the material to us. I think we all need to take in consideration that we are going through a pandemic and do not know what the outcome of it will be. Overall she was a pretty decent professor! | She always messes up when teaching a new topic and won't even correct herself when she realizes it. You basically have to teach yourself in this class. Especially during a pandemic and switching to remote learning, she made the class so much more difficult. I really wish I could have taken another professor. | Her accent is sometimes very hard to understand and she she speaks so quiet you can barely understand her. She contradicts herself a lot and has to look at the answer key for easy high school chemistry answers she graded incorrectly on the test. She will test you on things she taught in the beginning of the year. the labs are really hard good luck | She tends to teach material in January then test you on it in April. The labs she assigns are very hard; she has trouble doing them herself. | Such an amazing and understanding professor take her and you wont regret it. She makes sure that students understand what she teaches and there are no surprises on her tests. | While lectures are technically not mandatory, you NEED to show up. Bandy always tries to make sure you understand the materials and also uses feedback to make the class as good as it can be. She wants you to pass as much as you want to pass. | She knows her stuff in chemistry but b/c of that she expects you to know it after a few problems. She always has office hours definitely go to them and ask for help. Tests are OK, have to just study. Quiz almost every week but tests obviously weigh the most. She is very nice though, Chemistry is hard in general so you have to always practice | She does try her best in making sure her students are aware of the material, but she still moves too fast and expects us to know how to do problems 5 minutes after introducing it. Too many tests and quizzes and they do not correlate with the review or any prior assignments. She was gone for 3 weeks which made her have to cram material together | Its a pretty simple class, she does force you to come to review sessions that are not on chem days! And even for me right now, I have chem Tue and Thur, and she wants my whole class to hand in a take hoke quiz on Monday to her office. She forces stuff that she shouldnt and can be a bit of a pain in the neck . Just take Kasner or another Prof | She is nice usually but she sometimes makes the simplest things seem very difficult Her first exam is very hard She does not curve the tests If you ask her questions she will try her best to help Has a tough accent so you really have to pay attention She also contradicts herself a lot Quiz almost every week Do bad on exams grade will drop | Good teacher, accent makes it hard but shes very nice and wants to help you. Lectures were very understanding | She's a really great teacher. I did well because she went over everything and started from the very beginning (almost elementary), which is key when you get to Chem 120. Definitely ask questions and practice what she posts online because you will see it on the exams. Just study the PowerPoints, notes, and handouts. | She may be a nice person, but she even makes the simplest things seem difficult. I would prefer taking another professor just to ensure that your grade and sanity don't hit below zero. | Such an amazing person and professor. She really cares for her students and genuinely wants them to do well. She taught both lab and lecture and is so helpful. Shes very knowledgeable and knows what shes doing. Has office hours available and is there to help and explains in detail. If I could I would take her for every chem class there is. | Chemistry is a course that requires many hours and a lot of repetition to fully understand the material. Go to class, take good notes. your going to be confused so ask the stupid questions, ask the small questions, ask ask ask. She will deliver. Actually put the time in and watch your grade reflect that hard work. - P.D | If you are not good at math then I do not suggest this professor. She expects you to be able to understand and do the math after one example problem. You need to read the textbook because on the midterns there are questions that we didn't go over in class. | She was okay. Has a tough accent so you really have to pay attention. She also contradicts herself a lot and may get mad what you ask for help. Has three midterms that are counted as tests so make sure you do good on those. Gives quizzes every week but they don't count much towards your grade ( honestly). Oh and there's no homework. | What is she saying?! Half the time I didn't even know what this woman was saying. I'm sorry but on top of chemistry being my worst subject I did not need the thick accent and the constant contradictions and stuttering that came along with these incredibly long and tedious lectures with much studying only to be let down with a low grade. | I do not recommend that anyone should take this class. She is not a thorough professor. She contradicts herself often and makes a lot of mistakes. She does not teach well and rushes through everything. I did not like my time at all in her class and it was not conducive to learning. | She was very nice and a caring person, but she made the material a bit confusing. You have to really learn the stuff on your own and read the textbook to really understand it. In lecture, she made too many mistakes. Nothing that was on her exams were taught in the lecture. | She has a tough accent and she usually confuses topics and forgets a lot. One day she can say something and the next day she totally contradicts herself. If you are in her class, the only way you can do good is if you really focus and GO TO HER OFFICE ON HER OFFICE HOURS, SHE WILL HELP AND EXPLAIN THINGS BETTER. | My time in her class was very average. She wasn't that hard, but challenging at the same time. She gives a lot of quizzes and they are practically half way through a chapter. She gives in-class assignments during recitation classes which are graded and much harder since its open book. She gives 3 tests (which she calls midterms. Don't skip! | Shes a good teacher. This class was just hard. Its a lot of material. She gives a quiz once a week on the material she taught that week. The midterm isnt hard but if you dont know your material youll struggle. If you do bad on the quiz or midterm it will be hard to pass the class. No homework."
"Maranhao, Jack","He uses ChatGPT to generate his lectures, his tests, and his study guides. The study guides do not match the tests, so unless you are very proficient in R, they aren't doable without cheating. Additionally, he has a huge ego and is disrespectful to his students. Avoid this professor. | No respect for students, no effort into teaching his course, avoid this prof. Exams are not possible to do well on without cheating or having mastery of R as the note sheets that are supposed to prepare you are written by AI and have almost nothing to due with the exams. Calls out students and interrupts class, deducts points, rude, and entitled. | You need to have a lot of background in CS for this class to be doable. He is rude and condescending. The exams are much harder than homework assignments or projects. He is very responsive to emails and is helpful if you ask specific questions. Office hours are a great resource. He also boosts grades a little if you go to class consistently. | This is definitely going to be a difficult class if you don't have some background in computer science and there was definitely an issue with cheating on the quizzes as they are very hard. Overall though, he didn't fail anybody and gave 30% A's this semester and this is a great class to take to expand your programming/data science skills. | Worst professor I've had in 4 years at this school. Absolutely cannot teach, unapproachable when asking questions, and horrible grading policies. There was rampant cheating going on and if you didn't cheat, your reward for being honest is a lower grade than students who did. If you are between him and another professor, take the other professor. | Finds his own sources online (~90 documents). Reads in a monotonous voice with limited visualizations or insights. Extremely difficult to understand content (or even pay attention). Do not take this class without having a strong stats (and even calc) foundation. Rampant cheating. Cares about students but can be rude/difficult to approach. Avoid! | This guy has to be the worst professor that Rutgers has hired. Bro has the biggest ego of everyone that saying how he worked 20 years in Johnson and Johnson. He thinks he's better than everyone around. He call this student out for cheating cause he was left handed so he was lending towards his left side when he wrote. Worst professor ever | I am a straight-A student and have never withdrawn from a class before. Please be careful. I got A's on every homework assignment and understood every lecture, but I still got about 60% on every quiz. All of my friends experienced the same issue. No communication with TAs, rude if asked questions & belittles students. | Data101 is very difficult to pass unless you have a strong background in upper level statistics. Although the prerequisite is elementary algebra the course really requires a background in stats 1 and calc 2 at a minimum to grasp concepts. Quizzes are ridiculously hard and it's borderline impossible to get above an 80 even if you're a top student. | Having this professor at 8:30 made me go back to sleep. Not much work but exams are weighted heavily. He DOES give a final that IS REQUIRED even if in past years he made it optional. | Not a good professor at all. Terrible lecturer, unapproachable, difficult exams with questions on specific things that he barely covers. | Dr. Mardekian is very knowledgeable. However, he is not good professor. He speaks very slowly and quietly. His teaching style is more talking than teaching. He also tends to respond to student questions in a way that makes him unapproachable. Grading criteria and scoring are clear. | Not a good lecturer and exams were difficult, but he made up for it all by giving everyone an insane curve getting almost everyone doing bad to a B | This man cannot teach for his life even if it depended on it. He uses ChatGPT for all the exams, which is a very unfair way to do things. he like doesn't even tell us what the exams will emphasize and what are some things we should study more instead said ""I will win the war cause I lost the battle with the project"". His Grading depends on his mood | He is a passionate professor, however, can be a little confusing if you take more time to pick up on things. He lectured consistently and was on time. Was told there would be a curve at the end of the semester. | The professor struggled to convey material clearly, hindering students' understanding and learning experience. | Your perception of yourself will determine how successful you will be in this class. If you are not someone who can easily grasp the tiny details of a concept outside of a lecture, then don't take it. That's all. | I don't know how to explain it. Exam are just BS. He would find the smallest detail of a formula/concept and ask us. He allows 1 sheet of notes but that thing is useless unless you know what hes going test you. Doesn't ask us how to applied the formula, just ask small detail within the formula. Doesn't curve even though the class is cooked. | I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you teach I hate the way that you lecture | Terrible Professor who sounds very dull during lectures and shows no enthusiasm to teach whatsoever. His exams are no where near to what he teaches in class nor does his notes or practice exams have any relevance to the exams either. He makes scenes in class during exams disturbing other students. I do not recommend taking this professor. | I took this guy hearing about how hard the other professor was hard but boy was I wrong. This was a 100 level course but it felt like a 300-400 level class for no reason. Doesn't make his own content at all. He uses chatGPT for half of his material and chiefs off the other professor for the other half. Exams are worth 70% of your grade - insane. | Top 2 worst profs and hes not 2. lectures are random yap and he goes on tangents. His entire course is developed by chatGPT and he does not care about making his own content. Does not want you to succeed as he claims to wage war on students I quote ""You won the battle I will win the war"". Do not Take | Horrible professor. Horrible grader. Horrible attitude. His exams have nothing to do with lectures. During lectures, he drones over code for majority of the time and on his exams, there is virtually no code to be tested on. Every question is on theory which he barely discusses and clarifies during lecture. | For Data 101 - tough grader. NO curves on exams despite the mean being a 64 and mostly everyone I know got below a 78. Lectures are very messy and disorganized - no clear slides. For the lectures, he just uses random sources and PDFs of coding. Not helpful at all | In Data 101, exams aren't curved despite widespread failure, which seems unfair for an introductory class. The professor's teaching style, mainly reading slides and referring to the textbook, is also lacking. Based on these experiences, I can't recommend this professor. Most of the grade relies on difficult and unfair exams. No curves. | Attendance is mandatory; excused absences do not matter to the professor. Changed the grading toward the end of the semester. He made the final optional for those that missed fewer than 5 classes and gave no importance to those who missed classes due to illness and other important reasons. Exams involve interpreting R results on a sheet of paper. | Not too great honestly. Made final optional and basically showed us how to do all of the homeworks. Only problem was that quizzes were mad hard, the lectures were super dry, and the grading was not lenient at all. He emphasized that attendance would help improve grade but it didn't really for me. A bit rude when I ask questions. Wouldn't recommend. | He is nice and kind. Exams are tough but don't worry about it. He will not let you fail unless you have not been turning in your homework and do not take the exam. The 3-hour class is tedious, but I can feel that the teacher has tried his best to prepare the material for each class. So remember to read the book before each class. | He does not explain the materials just review them. Just throw them at you and it's up to you to understand them by yourself. He gives out documents that can be easily found online like from medium and wiki. He is a nice guy and cares about students. But I don't feel like I learned anything from this class. the good thing is he never fails you. | Professor Mardekian was one of the best professors that I have had at Rutgers and I highly recommend him. He has a lot of industry experience and focuses on the material that could be useful for real world projects which I think is great. He is always there for you if you need some advice or help. Homework, exams and grading are very reasonable. | Took Mardekian for STAT 490 and 467. He is really nice and understanding. TBH didn't really feel like I learned much and I did TRY to learn. His courses utilize R which is a great skill for interviews/ jobs, which is nice. He also decided that if you are satisfied with your current grade, you don't need to take a final! He also NEVER fails people. | wow. I have never had such a horrible course. He gives you homework that he doesn't show you how to do. It is so bad, doesn't make any sense, he should show students a concept, and then have them practice and apply. He will show some concept, and then test on a very advanced version of this concept that you need to learn from another source. | He teaches specific material, and then gives tests on things that were hardly/never covered. His lectures are BORING. His grading is good since he curves a lot but I feel like I learn nothing from his class. He is nice and responsive though, and will bump your grade up if you showed effort and are close to the next grade cutoff. | Good professor, cares about his students and wants them to succeed. This class was his 1st full time online session but he did a good job adapting, all the necessary material was uploaded and updated in a timely manner. His lectures drag on and can get boring, as he speaks very softly, but they are packed with information. | He definitely knew the material, and he explained most things well, but his exams had a lot of stuff that we never went over. I had the luxury of having recorded lectures due to the pandemic, but even then, his exams were hard. Sometimes you may be lost. His curves are insane, though, with 83 being the cutoff for an A when I had him. | Midterm, Final, Project, and HW are the grades. There's no way to prepare for exams, he gives only list of topics. He curves a lot. Lectures are pretty pointless, but attend since random sign ins. He answers all questions, but it's definitely not an easy B. Won't know grades until after the final is graded, since curve is up to him. | Very kind man. His explanations are very clear and answers any questions you have. There is heavy emphasis on programming and computer output (R and SAS). However because of this, the theory is heavily watered down. Theoretical concepts are normally given as optional supplemental reading. Thus, take him if you're looking for a job, not a PhD. | Very unorganized course. He posts his lecture notes online, but there all over the place. He stats exams are similar to the homework, but the homeworks are all coding and the exams have nothing to do with coding. One of the worst teachers that I had. | Good guy, tests are difficult but not as difficult as they are made out to be. Generous curve. Don't worry about taking notes in class, just PAY ATTENTION. He is not about memorization. You will do quite well if you pay attention to what he is saying, rather than writing down everything he says, which you won't understand without paying attention. | His only office hrs are before class. Print out his ppt, take notes, and pay attention! One midterm (w a generous curve), final project, and a final. Random quizzes in class that counts as EXTRA pts on midterm. He is VERY STRICT on academic honesty; don't even have a friend take your quiz, it's not worth it! Have him know your name! | Nice person. Exams are hard but have curve. Definitely go to his class and take notes! | This guy is not that great at teaching. He seems to be very cool on the first day, but he doesn't teach that well and tends to brush off students questions in an annoyed way. His tests are EXTREMELY difficult as well. But at least he tries to be fair in regards to how he grades exams and the class as a whole. The textbook is your best teacher | Hard material, but he explains in lectures. Exams were very difficult. Homework was due weekly; they were SAS assignments. A good portion of lecture was always spent in the ARC computer lab so he could explain the programming to us. Final was optional. You could decide to not take it if you were happy with your course grade. | great professor, really helps students but it is a hard course, a lot of new material and the exams were very hard, quizzes every class, but never keeps students the full 3 hrs, also very helpful to know a lot of SAS bc the hw probs are mostly on that | Two exams. One was open book but the book was pretty useless. If you go to class and listen to what he says you can get an A. If you just read the book, you won't do well unless you're an expert in stat. Pretty clear and simplifies concepts very well. Exams are straightforward. | Teaches using slides and gives computer programming assignments; so know your SAS but he helps as much as he can. If you attend classes, and do well on projects (which aren't hard), he gave the option of not taking the final! Very nice guy! Get to know him as well since you might get a higher grade if he knows you work hard."
"Bassolino, Donna","She's a super funny and unique professor. Although she grades strictly (I'm pretty sure all expos professors are strict with grading), she makes class discussion fun. Yet, when I mean fun, she doesn't make all classes fun, she is focused and teaches well but there are some days in which she likes to make jokes. | First of all unless you're an SJW you'll hate her and her grading. Her lectures are boring and don't help at all. She frequently assigns papers with vague prompts and one or two days to complete. And she constantly yells at people to not talk, even if they were just borrowing a pencil or something. Overall HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, avoid this woman. | She's just way too tough, and doesn't have any consideration towards your other needs, just gives papers and papers, and often gives you only 1 day to write a WHOLE essay. Emailing her won't do anything. Avoid at all costs | I had consistent C's on every paper and the final fifth paper I got a B so I ended with a B. The more work you put in, the better chance you have because simply doing her corrections won't guarantee an A. She's available outside of class and is very nice but you will need the textbook for quoting from stories on each paper but try to find it online | Expos is a hit and miss with which professor you have. She's a nice lady, but class was always so boring. Everyone is on their phones and she would ask us questions about the text that no one understands. This class felt more like I was in high school. I got the same grade for all papers, C so last paper I put 0 effort and still got the same grade | I loved her! She did her best to try and explain the text to the class, and she is very approachable as an instructor. Just don't be afraid to ask her for help and advice | It's a boring class. No reason to go to class other than the fact that she takes points off for being absent because she doesn't teach anything. Every class is pretty much discussion of the text or peer review which doesn't help for crap. Don't expect to learn anything. The feedback she gives is nothing more than couple of words here and there."
"Urakath, Rijo","He is very nice. I would show up unprepared and ask many questions about the lab but he would always answer them. at a certain point, I did see him get annoyed by my unpreparedness, but he is generous so be prepared and leave early."
"Khadr, Arwa","This course itself is tough, a lot of the work depends on your own review of the topics. You need to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to this course. Professor Gabr is proficient on lab topics, but she only sees things from a scholarly perspective, making it difficult for her to understand why students are struggling in class. | A very fast-paced anxiety-inducing lab. I understand independence and preparing for class but even with all the hours of studying it never felt like it was enough. It felt like she was never satisfied and expected us to know every single detail. Personality-wise she's very dismissive and at certain times felt disorganized. Overall bad environment. | If your dream is to be a doctor skip out on this lab course while you can. She gives excessively long homework assignments which take hours to read and have absolutely nothing to do with lecture or lab topics. Her group presentation and project is a huge part of your grade so expect to spend a lot of time working on that instead of studying. | Professor Gabr is really cool and funny, and excellent at lecturing. She explains clearly and is very willing to answer all your questions, but shes tough. I personally felt her quizzes to be an unfair representation of my knowledge on the subject. I could have studied for hours and still get lousy grades. Shes very specific also with her answers. | Great instructor. Very funny and makes lab relatable.... If you pay attention in lab, lecture would be a breeze. Come prepared to lab and do all you need to do and you should be fine | A lot of work. But very rewarding at the end. Thank You Ms. Gabr for a very challenging and rewarding experience. Wish you were the lecturer | Great teacher. Makes biology very interesting. | I attended one of her classes making up one of the labs I missed, and I rerated not registering for her section. She was amazing. She actually explains concepts and the lab for her students. For once I was not confused about the lab. Really frustrated because I could have learned a lot this semester. | I just love her. She's hilarious, and very passion about Biology. She explain everything so fully and clearly that it sticks with you. But, she's not an easy A, You have to study seriously and attend to do well | You're not going to like Ms. Gabr at first because the first impression you get of her is someone scary, but she's actually not that bad as a teacher. She's extremely helpful if you ask her for help and her quizzes are fair. The only problem is you have no idea what to expect for the quizzes. Expect WEEKLY homework on confusing scientific articles. | She's a horrible professor. | the only annoying thing about this course is the slidees you hve to draw for the first couple of weeks. but overall Prof. Gabr is a great prof. she gives materials that helps for the quizzes and if you have a lecture exam she will push off the homework to later that week so you could focus on the exam | This was my first my first course in Brooklyn college, and I really liked this course but it needed a lot of times. | As long as you read/ understand your labs ahead of time, keep up with the lecture chapters, and do the homeworks there's no reason for you to not do well. It definitely is a lot of work but it's manageable if you put in the effort. | The course is tough. But if you work hard it is very rewarding. Take Dr. McEntee for lecturer she is great. Gabr for lab, she is awesome. There for you when you need it. | Tough class. Great Lab instructor. I would take her again | The course is really challenging but very rewarding. You learn a LOT. The professor strict keeps you on your toes from the beginning to the end. She is very organized, clear, and very helpful. YOU HAVE TO BE IN HER CLASS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REALLY LEARN BIOLOGY. | This course requires work but I am ending the semester with so much knowledge in Biology. This was my first time taking Biology and I was worried about it being challenging. With studying and paying attention in lab you can definitely do well. Professor is extremely approachable and explains everything beautifully and is very fair and provides grea | She is serious, but very nice. It is a hard course with a lot of work. Very organized, quizzes are straight forward if you study the slides and the manual. | AVOID HER FOR LAB. MAKES BIO SO DIFFICULT. NICE IN PERSON BUT A TOUGH GRADER. READS THROUGH EACH WORD, OBSERVES YOU. REALYY TOUGH TO PASS ! | She is extremely hard,, teaches lab course for general bio but makes it so difficult to pass. Gives weekly HW unrelated to class work and very strict. Avoid her if you can. Lab quizzes are detailed and you have to memorize the entire lab manual. AVOIDD HER !"
"Zhang, Jianyuan","Prof Zhang cares about students and listens to suggestions. His exams are not straightforward, as he wants you to sort out the problems with taught concepts. Homework problems are very helpful though. Also his grades are generous. Like two thirds of the class got A with a low cutoff (lower 70s). | Bad Professor. Grades only made of tests and curve isn't even a curve-simply cutoffs for grades. Offers regrade requests for answers different from key but does not acknowledge them and says, ""look at the answer key it is not the same."" Also, very destructured class where content learned doesn't reflect the content tested on. Would not recommend. | this class is only graded on the midterms and finals, no extra assignments to boost your grade. there is no ""curve"" in the sense that your grade gets boosted up, but there is a cutoff. he's a kind and caring professor, but i did not learn in lecture and had to teach myself everything. | Prof. Zhang is a really chill dude who genuinely cares about his students. Although he does have an accent which does make it hard to understand him at times, he is happy to explain concepts again. Fall 2023 was the first time he taught ChemH315 and he did a great job. He was nervous about teaching us but he did good. For this course, READ THE BOOK | Professor Zhang is a pretty chill professor. While there were a few hiccups here and there in the course, he made sure everyone did well in his class. Definitely pay attention to his lectures and drill down the homeworks, as they mostly imitate the exams. He made the curve extremely generous for the class too. | Prof. Jason is amazing. This guy is one of the nicest you would ever meet. It's his first time teaching 315 but he did it very well. Very knowledgeable and caring. He offered office hours from 7 pm to 12 am before the final, this is how dedicated he is. His exams are based on lectures and homework. It's not a hard class but definitely needs work. | orgo is a difficult class, as to be expected, but he just spent all of his time just lecturing us. I wished that there was some sort of practice problems that he put on his slides that I could go back too (his slides are not very helpful unless you took notes in class). IMO recitation is really where you will learn the material, you should go!!! | I wish he provided more practice in class instead of just explaining the concepts as orgo needs practice. If you attend recitation/tutoring though you will be fine. No matter who you take orgo with it is going to be hard and there is a lot of self-studying. The grade is based on 3 midterms and a cumulative final. Professor is fine but course sucks. | Dont do it, i stopped going to class and when to tutoring every day after the first exam. granted i was behind on material the lectures are absolutely pointless to go to. My TA for recitation sucked too. Trying again next semster | Shocked by the positive reviews. I am a pre-med with a 3.9 GPA. I haven't received a grade lower than a B+. I study A LOT. I can only decipher MAYBE 20% of the lecture due to his extremely heavy accent. He's nice, sure, who cares? That isn't going to teach you the material. Also doesn't give homework, which is a must to practice. Take someone else! | Great professor. Really cares about his students | Prof Zhang is very knowledgeable in the field. He listens to every suggestion and critique that students have to bring. He uploads videos where he goes over the entire chapter and the exams as well. Go in this class with an open mind and be prepared to do a lot of practice problems and studying. One of the best chem profs in the department. | Professor Zhang is a very knowledgeable man. The slides he posts are decent and the textbook contain many problems that you should be doing daily. Also, erase all preemptive ideas you have of organic chemistry as a whole. This class could be stressful but walking in with the right attitude makes a huge difference. Practice doing problems online too | Absolutely stellar professor, made learning organic chemistry manageable and is one of the few Rutgers professors that truly took student feedback into consideration/cared about students. More importantly, he ensured grades/tests were as fair and balanced as they could be. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the subject; it showed. | This class is so difficult but Zhang just genuinely cares so much about his students and really wanted to see us succeed in this course. You're still going to have to study a bunch and the textbook is a really good resource but honestly Zhang motivated us so much. | Professor Zhang is hands down one of the best orgo307 professors. He really cares. You still have to study your butt off for the exams. But he uploads videos on the exam to explain everything. His powerpoints are also super helpful. He also has his office hours as a facebook page, which at first I didn't like but it's useful when studying for final | The class is difficult, don't get me wrong, but professor Zhang is really clear about what things will show up on the midterm. He has an accent but he explains things really well. His exams aren't too difficult if you do all the problems in the textbook. For the practice he assigns, he gives video explanations of the answers. Best prof in orgo307 | As dreadful as this course is, I think that Professor Zhang really tries his best to teach this course. He tries to compare a lot of the concepts by using analogies to help us. However, the course is only based off of 3 midterms, and your final is 50% of your grade. It is a hard course, so I would suggest getting the textbook to learn most. | This class is overall ridiculous and requires hours and hours of studying, but this is Jasons first semester teaching and he did a pretty good job. He isnt a very good teacher, but he definitely makes an effort to try to address the problems that students have. His lecture slides are very useful in studying for exams. | This was Professor Zhangs first time teaching Orgo I. He cared significantly more than the other 2 professors and tried to be as upfront with the students about exam material as he could. Lecture notes are also the best of the 3 professors. He even held more office hours right before the final until late because he knew students had questions. | This was Professor (Jason) Zhang's first semester teacher Orgo307. He was the only one of the three professors who actually seemed to care about his students. He tried to teach organic chemistry in a way that made sense and was very open about what would be on exams. This course is extremely difficult and graded/structured ridiculously."
"Nieuwkoop, Andrew","Andy was a solid teacher, his lectures were often really fast so it can be a little difficult to take notes. But he's good at answering questions and slowing down if you ask. He also had such a deadpan humor and it was the best haha. His tests were difficult, but definitely doable especially if you understood the homework and quizzes | Andy is awesome--clearly knows his stuff and is super willing to help you. Definitely don't neglect your textbook though, because he can sometimes lecture pretty quickly, and you'll want to have a good idea of whats going on before coming into class. Pay attention to the in-chapter examples and lecture examples because they'll show up on the exam."
"O'Carroll, Deirdre","Great professor. Read the book, pay attention during lectures, and do homework problems and you'll be fine on the exams. Nothing is out of left field on the quizzes/exams"
"Case, David","Nice & gave good advice. Made the lecture easy to understand. Exam is long & hard. He cut each PA by half compared to Fall. Made it half as much work due to class is half the time. Midterm was 3 hours and final was 4 hours; code(20-30%), mc(20%), short answers (30-45%), and long answers (6 sentence) (15-20%). The average was around 60 to 70%."
"Kimmel, Jane","Her exams are difficult, make sure you understand the lecture slides and all the HW as well as recitation problems. Hourly exams were not too bad but final was heavy. She is very responsible if you send her email and she cares about students. The curve is good | She is not a good Professor.Her exams are extremely hard. | I didn't attend lectures so I can't comment on her teaching. All exam questions came directly from the slides or homework problems. You actually have to understand each and every slide her slide shows to do guaruntee a good grade on exams. She tends to just pick a few topics and really hone in on them during the exam while not touching others. | I wish I wasn't forced to go to Rutgers as I earned a scholarship. The only positive thing I can say is Prof Hinch was not as bad as Prof. jimininez. Rutgers has some a few talents in the sciences but, so far while I am a woman in science, my female professors in the sciences at Rutgers have been the worst! Scholarships be damned as I teach myself. | The lectures are very material heavy, so it is true that at times they are difficult to follow. I had to force myself to get used to her monotone lectures, but they do actually make sense and aid studying. Read the textbook and make sure to work through the suggested problems or at least look at her solutions. Exams are mostly problem solving. | I suspect if you gave an actor w a HS diploma 30mins to review the material before presenting, it, their performance would resemble Hinch's lectures. It's actually amazing how convoluted her explanations are. Anyway, shes prime example why tenure shouldnt exist, and you're going to have to teach yourself all of physical chem so good luck | I used to think Hall was the mad face of the chem department till I took this class, and she proved me wrong. Lectures are made to put you to sleep and her voice makes it definite. Don't waste time on lectures or lecture notes rather study exams and suggested problems. averages were about 50+-5 and the curve was 10+ points. lots of calculus. | Attending lectures will not help with anything. Rather, lectures make materials even more UNinteresting. Exams are insanity itself. Need I say more? Professor gets an F. | Dr. Hinch is really nice, but she isn't very good at giving an interesting lecture. Furthermore, while she provides you with a practice exam for each test, those practice exams often are nothing like the actual exam is. | She literally reads off of her powerpoints every class. She is the most boring professor I have ever had. There are 10 people that attend her lectures because they are a waste of time. Unfortunately, she is the only one teaching this course, so you have to bear with her. Haven't taken an exam yet, but from what I've heard, they're incredibly hard | I usually hold off at least a month before I rate a professor, but I only needed one class for her. Key point: clarity, or lack there of. Absolutely senseless, has no idea what she's teaching or where she is. Stops and goes back to correct things written in her chicken scratch--impossible to understand. 55 min for 2 dimensional analysis problems. | Worst professor in the history of ever. Exam average with cotter: 70. Exam average with hinch: 45. | I have no idea how in the world I got an A in this class. This professor is the hardest person to follow along with than any other I've had, and trust me, I've had some pretty incomprehencible ones! Granted, she only taught the 2nd half of the course, but still...perhaps the average was so low that my 81% was good enough for an A. | Quite possibly the worst teacher in the history of my educational experience (since Kindergarten). She should quit her job and work at Taco Bell. | This professor is the worst teacher i've ever had through the history of my education. She does not care about any of her students and will lower final course grades. I still don't understand why she is still at Rutgers, she must have tenure. She could smoke cigarettes with Erkan for all I care. It wouldn't make any difference anyway. | Okay she seems to have a good personality, but that doesn't help me understand what she is saying in lecture. IMHO she should at least try to write as a human being. Even my handwriting when I was 6 years old is probably better than hers. I hate when she has questions which she never went over in class on the exam. Also the formula sheet is retard. | Worst professor I ever had at Rutgers...and I've had some bad ones. She doesn't even know what she's teaching. She'll take breaks during class to learn the material she's supposed to be teaching. Nothing is clear. Here quizzes and exams have nothing to do with what she taught. Do you want extra help? You're not going to get it from her..."
"Bean, Brynn","Dr. Dooley is just a delight. She makes the lectures so fun and interesting, it's just a pleasure to be in the classroom learning from her. She's also extremely good at being a professor. Always available, always reachable. She knows each of her students to the bone, and is capable of handling all types of personalities because she's that good. | Literally the best professor! She is easy to talk to and genuinely wants all her students to succeed. I wish every professor at Seneca was like her. | An amazing prof that goes into details about what she teaches! She makes herself available to students to ask questions and to better understand material. The lectures are tied into what is taught in the labs which make the course that much more enriching. Attend her problems sessions (easy marks), alot of that material will be on the exams. | Best. Prof. EVER. I have not met an instructor who takes your interests to heart as genuinely as Brynn does. I love that she never sweats the small stuff, focusing singularly on your understanding of the course material to get you ready for the field. Easily my most favourite prof at Seneca. | wonderful and amazing professor, and you willlearn alot from her class | One of the best teachers at Seneca. Really helpful and informative. She also genuinely cares. | Brynn Dooley is a great teacher. When you first meet her, she may seem a little difficult and stubborn in her ways, however she becomes a pleasure to deal with later on. Her passion for teaching and love for what she knows is amazing. She is knowledgeable and inspirational. Seneca College needs more new teachers like her. Out with the old! :)"
"Mummidi Manuraj, Bhavani Nandhini","Avg. professors know their material and have knowledge in his/her field; but this doesn't mean they're good instructors. This exceptional professor has a valuable skill of effective verbal communication apart from her knowledge in the field making you understand & break down concepts w/ utmost clarity. Very kind & helpful, one of the best I've had"
"Baker, John",John is a really nice guy who will willingly help you throughout the semester. To get a good grade you just have to take his feedback on your papers and really use it. He will let you out early some classes too | Great professor. Just follows the department's rules and all but tries to help you as much as he can. And you can always email him with any questions and he writer back with goof advice. | He is SO nice & pretty funny too. He does whatever he can to help you write a good paper. Sometimes even lets students out early!
"Jones, Taro","Iran/Iraq was the second class I took with Toby and he continues to deliver stellar lectures and valuable insights. However, I felt that quality participation in discussions required extensive background knowledge in 20th century global politics and middle eastern history, so be prepared for that. | Great professor and human. He is so willing to help his students and is very cooperative in class. He assigns readings for discussions every class, and the grades come from your participation and two papers. The readings are long, but summaries/skimming should be efficient. He is extremely personable and an amazing professor to take. | Simply wonderful professor and class. Discussion based lectures. Readings assigned weekly that are worth doing. 3 papers (including the final paper). Genuinely an extremely knowledgeable and overall great professor. Even people with prior knowledge can and will learn something in class. 11/10 It was a delight to take a class with this prof :) | Professor Jones is the best professor I ever had at Rutgers. He is great and he cares about each student and wants them all to succeed. He encourages conversation during class as the class I took History of Oil was a discussion class and not a lecture class. The only grades we had were a few papers all under 800 words and participation in class. | I wish I could select more tags to sum-up this professor, but without a doubt he's definitely one of my favorite of all time. He is super chill and specifically for this course its discussion based on the readings he assign, and while the readings do require effort, it'll help your knowledge on how the world really works. 10/10 GOAT Professor | every day was a discussion on the assigned reading (some were quite long, but you can skim/find summaries online). it lasted as long as people provided input basically, then the lecture would start, with a lot of questions to the class in btw material. only two short papers, one i did on an anime movie. I really like prof jones!! :) | Probably the best professor I've had so far. Mr. Jones is extremely knowledgeable of the material he teaches and also really well spoken. At the same time, if you want you can put in minimal effort and get a pretty good grade. There was one quiz and 3 essays that he is a really easy grader on. This may not be true at 300+ level though. | Probably the best history professor I've ever had. Super smart guy. Graded by 2 papers and a huge attendance grade but I think that was mostly because he took over a few weeks after the initial professor couldn't continue the class. The texts he gives, although lengthy to read, are phenomenal. | The semester started fine with Mr. Jones but closer to the end he changed the grading system which felt unfair. The classes were just lectures so very boring and felt impossible to learn anything. There's no homework, just three essays. I got A's on the first 2 and got so burnt out by finals that I failed the third. | Prof Jones is a super cool guy and a decent professor, though I think hed be a lot better in person or in a synchronous class because itd be easier to discuss the material. Pretty easy grader as long as you do the work. Itd be good to have an extensive knowledge of history though because he just jumps right in without explaining events. | Professor Jones was one of my most favorite professors. His class, when it was taught in person was completely discussion based with no lectures. (All you had to do was the reading). He knew a lot about history and really made you question the material he was teaching. He would challenge your viewpoints and make you see history from all sides. | Professor Jones is great! Grading was based on participation (40%) and 3-4 short papers (60%). Weekly readings, but they weren't long. Participation is based on in-class discussion, so it helps to speak up even if you just ask a question. Extra points for sharing interesting opinions. A real expert in his field and a down-to-Earth person. | Prof Jones is such a down to earth professor. I would only take his class if you're really interested in the class or you have good prior knowledge about the Middle East. He talks fast and occasionally uses notes so be sure you're able to catch details that he mentions. He grades fairly & there's no hw & there's 5 reading quizzes + midterm + final | This man is the real deal! so funny, down to earth, and so smart! i love when a prof can teach and actually enjoy it, the whole atmosphere of the class changes thanks to him! highly recommend him if you want an A but also to actually learn at the same time without the typical stress! | Prof Jones is extremely knowledgeable regarding the Middle east, oil, and modern day politics. His lectures are always super fun and funny, and he loves to hear other students opinions. He grades very fairly, mostly just assigns a few papers, and hes like that super modern and cool HS teacher we always treasure, Jones is a must take! History of oil | Amazing class! Made me more interested in history, will definitely take another of his courses. | Very easy class, says from the beginning that he doesn't care whether you come or not. Grade based on 1 map quiz, and 6 essays. 4 essays are short and easy, midterm/final essays are standard 5-7 p. Easy grader as long as sourcing is to his liking and you make a clear argument (does not have to be original). Lectures are not boring but not great | I took him for History of the Modern Middle East. Clearly knowledgable of the subject matter. Has background in the history of oil and its politics essentially acts as the backdrop for this course. Very interesting. Class is less lecture, more discussion. There are no tests, rather 5 short and 2 long papers, and a map quiz. | No syllabus from this class. He is an extremely interesting lecture and gets you motivated to want to do work. Sometimes he is disorganized, but he will admit this and therefore be more lenient with the work. Overall amazing professor and very persuasive, definitely a professor to take before you graduate. | Jones is clearly very knowledgeable about the middle east and does a great job painting a story-like, non- biased narrative of controversial issues. He often abandons the syllabus and asks us what we want to talk about instead (answering questions about ISIS current events) Awesome prof, easy grader, awesome guy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. | Professor Jones is very interesting. His experience with modern middle eastern history makes this course one of the most interesting courses in the department. He is not always around though, frequently cancelling class and assignments, and often difficult to track down. | Amazing class! I took Toby with the Oil and the Middle East Seminar. I was afraid that the work might be too much, but he is a great professor and very understanding. Have to do a 20+ page research paper at the end, and smaller assignments leading up to it. Lots of reading, but amazing discussion. Learned a lot! Must take class! | Great professor. Generally impartial (especially with this being such a heated topic). He knows what he's talking about. Absolutely wonderful lecturer. Must take notes though, his slides are pretty basic. There's a midterm, final, 1 paper, and ""random"" quizzes (reminds the students of). I loved the class, probably my fave prof and class at Rutgers. | Not a hard class: midterm, take home final, and reading quizzes, which are ""random"". Prof. Jones is amazing, he really knows the subject and explains the conflict in an impartial, if it is possible, and brilliant way. Take him!! | in general he is a great professor with a sense of humor and a lot of knowledge. i learned so much this class so i was happy about that. you have to be prepared for reading quizzes. they make up the most of your grade unfortunately (40%)...i would have gotten an A but the first two quizzes killed it for me. but i would recommend taking him anyway | Had him for IranIraq and now in his ArabIsraeli class. In general fairly easy, doesn't take attendance, but you can't miss the unanounced quizes, he'll only let you make them up if you were legitimately sick. I got a B in IranIraq and I was barely in class- and it was a 50 person class, not lecture hall where he wouldn't have noticed me. Good Prof. | Great young teacher--he isn't a professor yet, but he definitely will be. There is a lot of reading which you don't necessarily have to do, but it helps you in class discussion. Your grade is mostly participation based. I loved the class, loved the professor! | Cool guy. Has a sense of humor, when he figured out I wasn't doing the reading he joked about it in class. Really knows his stuff, He created this class. Gives a lot of reading but you can get away with not doing it. His essays aren't easy but they're not hard either. Put in some effort you're guaranteed an A. Would take again. | Attendance is not mandatory , but miss 2 or more class's and I'd bet my life that you'll only get a B+ at best (if you ace both papers). Reading is intensive and if you skip an assignment , kiss your A goodbye. I agree with the rater before me, 100 and 200 are easy, but 300 and above is really hard. Not an easy A at all. Readings can be tough... | Professor Jones is a truly awesome professor. He is an engaging lecturer and is more than willing to meet with you to help you out if you need it. In Arab-Israeli conflict he seemed to let his own personal opinions creep into the class a bit, but it was nonetheless a good experience. Highly recommended! | Yea Jones is an easy prof at the 100 and 200 level, but if you think thats gonna happen at the 300 level or above,think again. its not an easy A, although attendance is not mandatory, if you miss 3 class or more your pretty much setting your self up defeat. Reading is long and intensive,and you need to do it all to pass. Grades tough on the papers. | Class wasn't that bad. Really keeps interest in topics but his grading is not that great. Just a single map quiz was 15% of your grade (which could be helpful but i didn't know it having missed the first class) and he didn't announce it as well. A = 90-10, B+ is just 88-89 and anything below is a B. This was absurd but nice prof overall. | Great professor! Prof Toby Jones is probably one of the best professors at Rutgers! He keeps his class interesting through out the semester and allows you to speak about the readings during class, which really brings to life the story of the middle east, thus making learning interesting! Read and participate, show up to class, it's an easy A! | Modern Middle East is a pretty expansive course no since you go from the time of the prophet all the way to today! Jones was a pretty cool teacher; the first pop quiz was hard, but he drops the lowest one and if you read carefully you'll do well on the other quizes.The midterm is so easy;the average was an 85. There is a normal amount of reading. | Modern middle east is a hard class because of the pop quizzes, which make me feel nervous. I am not great in history, but Dr. Jones is a nice guy who makes the class interesting. He is very helpful in class and is always happy to answer questions in class. | Taught Modern Middle East and Arab Israeli Conflict.Actually cares about students.Will make every attempt to help you if you put in the effort. For classes below the 300 level its an easy A if you do the readings, participate in class discussions, and prepare for the exams well in advance(like 2 days).For 300+ level, you really work your ass off!"
"Khare, Sagar","This is a tough class to follow along and nothing he teaches is on the test. If your just okay in chemistry then I'm afraid you will not do well in this class . He is friendly enough but not a good professor. Everything just comes out of left field. | The exams are incredibly difficult and don't seem to evaluate your learning fairlyrelevantly. He likes to throw problem types you've never seen before on exams. Don't take unless you're already good at chemistry or a chem major. He only seems friendly and easygoing to make up for the fact that most people fail his exams. Good guy, bad professor. | Very great teacher. Prepares you for exams, but it's up to you to invest more time being up to speed with the material. Exams are challenging but are not impossible as long as you pay attention. Offers good help and lots of extra credit. I recommend the class if you want to learn chemistry while challenging yourself | good class. tests are tough. | great professor! only wished that the tests weren't so difficult, but the extra credit he offered made up for it. be ready to be able to apply yourself. as long as you pay attention in class and read, there's no reason you shouldn't get below a b+ | Class and professor are both tough. Been great at chemistry but the test this guy gives are out of left field. Not enough time to finish 5 out of 10 , its that bad! Nice guy but does not teach what he presents to you on tests. I'd say skip this class. | Great professor. Challenges you to think and recognize concepts. You will not do well if you are a straight memorizer. Prepares your for the future because you will learn to apply yourself with knowledge presented. Exams are difficult, but if you understand the material you will be able to do well. Offers extra credit but they are insanely hard | He teaches from the book, but some topics are too advanced for a General Chemistry course. The majority of the problems on his exams involve a lot of critical thinking and are not straightforward. Most students do not finish the exams in the time given. I got all A's on the recitation quizzes given by the TA but got significantly lower exam scores. | WOW THE EXAMS ARE IMPOSSIBLE. I had a 94 avg in CHEM163 so I decided to take this class inspite of the reviews. Exams are completely out of left field and don't really tie in much to anything I studied. Cool guy, but exams are crazy. I literally didnt know how to solve 8/10 problems each time and I'm amazing at chem. Woulda got an A in regularchem. | Cool dude, exams are difficult but overall he was a pretty good teacher. Read the textbook before lecture to know what's going on, keep up with material and you'll be fine. | He's a chill, hilarious Indian dude who's really the kinda professor who wants you to succeed, offering extra credit and exam re-dos. He even makes attendance optional. His exams are HARD though, keep up with the class and STUDY if you want an A! | Hard class. Cool guy. Wish exams weren't so complicated."
"Brennan, John","cool class, but hard to understand anything when you cant see the professor. | He's great, but I had trouble seeing him at times. | He was just plain amazing | He is the champ"
"Marvasti, Setareh","She assigns readings and practice questions from the textbook associated with each lecture. Do the readings for that lecture 1-2 days before the lecture, and then do the practice questions after the lecture. She treats lecture as a ressitation, only doing practice questions. You must teach yourself the content on your own in order to pass. | Honestly loved this professor. She really cared for her students and made a really hard subject manageable To succeed I say look over past exams, read the textbook, and attend office hours. | I had her for online chem recitation. She explained the concepts very well and cares a lot about her students. Her office hours are also very helpful. I would 100% take her as my chem recitation professor again. | She doesnt teach more than whats already written in the book, word for word. she re writes the notes on a yellow pad and confuses the class more. Just do as many practice problems outside of class to understand the material and youll be better off. ask the TA for help cause she wont answer your emails. | Marvasti's lectures consist of her reading her notes while rewriting them on a note pad. FYI, she will have many technical difficulties with the projectors. Advice: Do as many practice problems as you can and read the book. KEEP UP WITH THE HOMEWORK. She wants her students to do well & will take the time to go through questions during office hours. | take chem in the summer and try to avoid this professor. she does not answer emails on time and she always re-writes the textbook. word for word. | She just copies and pastes the textbook word for word on a yellow notepad. Hard to work with and not much help from the TA's either. | I never did homework and got an A just from reading the book. Curve is generally nice but the class is pretty easy. A lot of people get screwed over because the simply do not understand the subject. You can always go to office hours for clarity. | Hate chem, class was tough | She is such a kind person and easy spirit. Prof. Marvasti is one of the best chem Prof. you can take. Although her teaching method which is copying and pasting same texts from the text book word by word does not work at all, she is always there if you have any questions. Lectures are useless, so you have to do all the work and study. | She is such a kind person and easy spirit. Prof. Marvasti is one of the best chem Prof. you can take. Although her teaching method which is copying and pasting same texts from the text book word by word does not work at all, she is always there if you have any questions. Lectures are useless, so you have to do all the work and study. SHE ISN'T BAD | Do not take chemistry over the summer and try to avoid taking this class by taking another chemistry because this class is just the textbook being read and written word for word over and over. You would be better off teaching yourself as nobody goes to lecture. | DON'T TAKE CHEM OVER THE SUMMER. You will be teaching yourself and the pace moves so fast. I tried so hard to understand it, but chemistry concepts take time and practice. I fell behind because I was taking lab at the same time. I BARELY passed and I even PAID for a tutor. I'm not stupid, I just can't teach myself things like quantum mechanics... | Prof. Marvasti seems helpful at first but her lectures seem to drag on as she reads straight from the textbook and re-writes it and makes her students rewrite it as well. She isnt too good with helping out students through email or online so try to talk to her in person cause she will forget that she needs to help students instead of stress them. | Marvasti is a nice person but a very poor professor. She doesnt teach she only re-writes the textbook. Her lectures seem long because all you do is re-write what she writes in her notes, which is the textbook. Dont go to lecture and dont ask her for guidance because she is always busy and tends to forget to help students. | The final exam was nothing like what we had to teach ourselves throughout the semester. The chem department is very lazy and uses the ACS final rather than making their own. Dr Marvasti not only tends to be unhelpful, she only re-writes the textbook in class so it is hard to learn anything in lecture because you are too busy writing. | Professor Marvasti seems to have a never-ending lecture because she just writes the textbook again and makes you re-write it as well. It seems like you cant pay attention cause you're too busy trying to keep up with writing. She also doesnt help or answer emails too often as its a guess and check situation with her. | This class is basically a teach yourself class. Read the textbook because all she does in lecture is re-write it on a notepad. She is not very helpful as she does not answer emails on time or acts like she cares. Try to speak to her in person but even that might not help. The chem department is not very helpful. Make sure to read the textbook. | Don't take this class. She does not answer emails ever. You have to email her a good ten times. She definitely does not help students at all and does not really care about giving her students a proper education. You are basically paying to teach yourself so beware. | Her lectures do not help at all as she just writes the textbook again on a notepad. Get ready to teach yourself the whole textbook as exams as very difficult and have bad curves. If you need help or guidance do not email her because she will not be willing to help or answer the emails. The chem department in general is not very helpful. | Took 159 and 160 with marvasti. Chem department manages to maintain a D exam average for each semester. Amazing! Barely any curve also. Chem department seems to be too lazy to make their own final and rather give the ACS which has no way to efficiently prepare for! | Hard tests. Do the hw. Labs are tedious and extensive. But just prepare and you'll do fine. | Marvasti is one of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She writes quickly on her notes, but she is always open to questions and will stay after class for as long as you like to answer questions. In addition to her notes, it is imperative to read the textbook because her notes are an outline of the textbook. What a great woman. | At first I went to and paid attention to every lecture and just barely passed the first midterm. After that I decided to self-study the material using the textbook and online resources and I got an A on the 2nd midterm and the final. Read the textbook since there's not enough time in lecture for her to cover everything, you'll be better off. | Marvasti is the best professor I've had this semester. She's always there to clarify anything for you and offers yo give you her notes every lecture. She really wants her students to pass and is clear and fun in lecture. | Marvasti is a nice person and decent lecturer, but she only barely skims the surface of the material in class. Reading the textbook is an absolute must, rendering the lectures fairly useless. However, she will typically stay for a while after class to answer everybody's questions one-on-one. | She's very nice, but I hated her teaching style. It's just endless note taking for the entire lecture; she goes so fast that you can't even remember what you wrote after lecture is over. Exams are difficult if you didn't take AP Chem in high school. She teaches the first 1/3 of the course while Hove teaches the latter part. | Dr. Marvasti is awesome! She is such a sweet heart and cares so much about her students. Analytical Chem is a lot of work but all the exam and lab questions are straight from the Homework problems (DOO THEM) and her lecture powerpoints. You have to go to class but she tells you which questions are on the exam. She is an awesome professor! TAKE HER! | Dr. Marvasti spends the entire lecture writing the textbook verbatim on her yellow notepads. Its the same notepads year after year -- I bet there are boxes full of them in her office. At least the notes are thorough and you can understand her. I basically taught myself. | She simply rewrites the notes from the textbook. Word for word. The notes are online too so there is really no point in going to lecture. I had to teach myself everything I learned in this class. HW is not mandatory, but probably recommended. | She literally has the exact same notes year after year, word for word. Even the examples have the same values. I had an old notebook from a friend, so eventually I just stopped going to lecture b/c with the notes I had there was really no point. She's good about asking if anyone has any questions, but she teaches everything like it's a review. | She's just copying notes in every class. Moves and writes VERY fast. Handwriting not legible. She's boring and tried to make the class funny but failed.. She can write a page in 3 minutes! I felt really prosaic in class... Copying books, copying notes, reading books, reading notes...Not very helpful:( | very helpful and approachable. I am an international student and was confused about things like SAKAI etc and she helped me a lot. I advise everyone to go ask her questions after the class. She will go out of the way to help you. | Clear explanations. Doesn't cover the difficulty level that we will be facing during the exam; only gives the basic overview during class. | She goes incredibly fast during lectures and barely has time to answer questions. Her handwriting isn't very legible as well. Most people end up skipping lecture and learning it on their own with the book. Exams are hard but have good curves. | Awesome teacher, outlined notes perfectly, very easy to understand, always enthusiastic about teaching. I would recommend her to anyone! | Overall a good teacher, the course is tough but she explains everything clearly during lecture. She is also willing to help you during her office hours. | She was a good teacher... Just a really tough course | Dr. Marvasti is so nice and willing to help anyone with a question. She really wants her students to understand the material she presents and always encourages everyone to come to her office hours. If I were a chemistry major, I would definitely take her again and would recommend her to anyone thinking about taking her class. | Very nice and helpful, went too fast and the exams and quizzes were hard but she was good imo. The guy who switched with her halfway through the semester was AWFUL. I don't remember his name but he sucked. | Tries her best to help students succeed in the class, but she goes a bit fast during lectures. Sometimes misses out on some information, so reading the book for this class is very important. I wouldn't say exams are fair, but they are very tough and you must study for them. But if you put your time in, you get a grade for what you put in | Marvasti's lectures are like being in a high school class. For me, this was a good thing, but for others it may not be. If you're an engineer, unless you have AP chem credit, there's no avoiding her. But she's really nice, a great recitation teacher, and her quizzes and exams are reasonable. | Excellent lecturer that keeps your attention. | Her method of using a projector to display what she writes on a notepad may be hard to adapt to, but she does try her best to sound lively; I actually hardly see people sleeping in class. She puts lecture notes/supplements online that you can use to follow along which really helps by the way if you use it to write notes on the side as clarification | She is a really good teacher. College chem isn't easy so you should put effort in and read the book. She moves fast in lecture so if you have any questions go to her office hours, she will really help you there. She loves teaching | I took chemistry with her over the summer, and despite hearing that she has the tendency to move very fast, I actually enjoyed her pace. She wrote the notes along with us on the overhead so there is no rush to write. She is definitely one of the sweetest professors as well. She is a must havee! | Dr.Marvasti is a great professor. She actually cares about her students and her lectures are so helpful. Best professor at Rutgers. | I really enjoyed her lectures. She is easy to talk to and encouraged us to ask questions. :) you can tell she is passionate about chemistry and that is important when it comes to professors. | She is so sweet! Hated chemistry and never complained about going to her class because she is such a good professor! | I passed this class and I know no more about chemistry now than when I went in. I may have gotten dumber taking this class. The exams are not taken from the book, so the book is useless. You're better off teaching it to yourself online anyway. Overall, a pretty bad teacher that you can't avoid due to limitation of professors."
"Lee, Joon","He's such a caring, sweet guy. I would definitely go to the lecture even though it not mandatory and go to his office hours if struggling. He genuinely wants to see you strive and succeed. | I had Jae Ki Lee as a TA for recitation. He is such as sweet guy and always made sure everyone understood the material before he moved on. When we have questions, he explains it super well. I actually learned more here than in actual lecture. Attendance is not mandatory, but you needed to show up to take the quizzes which were super easy. Take him!"
"Knapp, Spencer","Make sure to consider carefully before taking this class. His class is not inspirational, and he is not a good lecturer. He will potentially lower your interests in learning. If you consider taking his class, make sure to not lose your interests in chemistry and in learning. Very hard class. | Very funny, but he is hard no doubt about it. The material is also hard so I cant blame him too much. Very helpful. | He isn't a bad professor.. until you take one of his exams and realize how unfair that exam was. The chemistry department actually apologized to us (in their own way) because his exam was beyond ridiculous. Take anybody else if possible. | A very friendly and nice professor but his exams are very difficult. The material on the exam is not covered in lecture or in the notes so I guess you have to pull the information u need to know out of thin air. Good luck future organic chemistry students, you are definitely going to need it if this guy is teaching Organic chemistry | he is absolutely horrible!!!! | Must read the textbook in order to past the test. The tests are nothing like the online practice tests, they seem much harder. A lot of information being thrown out in a little bit of time. | This is not an easier version of Orgo, it is 2 semesters condensed into one. The tutors couldn't always help me because the stuff we were learning they has learned in Orgo II or Biochem. There is way too much material in this class and recitation. Don't take it unless you like cramming. | Nice professor! You can do well as long as you read the book and do the problems. The notes are a good supplement to the book. | The class is chalenging, but read the book, go to lecture, and do the homework and its not to hard to pass. The class average (~60%) is approximately a C+ at the end, so its a good curve. He holds review sessions before exams. He seems to have a little attitude, but he is still willing to help. This class sure beats the 2 semester orgo. | Course: Elementary Organic Chemistry Dr. Knapp was VERY helpful. Even if I did not have an qppointment, he was willing to take time and help me to get an A. THis subject is hard, but he will work with you until it makes sense. | Orgo is not the easiest subject in the world and neither is he, but if you work hard, read ahead, go to class, and pay attention you can learn the material. | reads the book in class, late with final grades, inconsiderate"
"Narayanan, Buvaneswari","This guy is not the best at teaching, he tries, but does not succeed. I literally learned everything myself. | Intro to Linear Alg isn't supposed to be hard. This prof goes at a somewhat quick speed. Consider taking another professor however it's the course material that is hard. You will have to learn it regardless. Maybe 6-12 hours per week of work if you want an A. He is a smart guy and as a prof he is fair. | Is he the best professor? No. With that being said, the material he teaches is not easy to grasp and almost everyone taking it hasn't been exposed to it (so obv its hard). Pay attention to lecture and *try* to understand the material - his courses and quizzes are very straightforward: he does not want you to fail. Make use of TAs. | Reads straight from textbooks and assumes that you will understand the Theorems on the first go. If you want to do well, prepare for lectures ahead of time although no college student will be able to regularly do this. I'd suggest taking Linear Algebra at Rutgers over the summer at a CC; there is no curve"
"Gu, Yuwei","This professor is an ABSOLUTE GEM in the chemistry department. He is a very knowledgeable man, having extensive expertise in the field of polymer chemistry. He is able to take complex topics and explain them in a very understandable and engaging fashion. Very accessible after class and responds to emails in a timely manner. Absolute must-take. | Dr. Gu was an absolute G. Had him for Orgo 2 last year and his lectures were top notch. He recorded all of them and made sure to post them after class so we could review. He also sent out a bunch of his annotated notes and a lot of practice homework. You will learn so much from him. | Yuwei is one of the best profs I had in college. You can tell he really cares for his students and our success. He provided so many resources that would be useful. His office hours are extremely helpful. Also, his exams are a bit hard, but he gave partial credit. He recorded lectures and posted plus he did exam reviews, which were very useful. | Yuwei is very passionate in his teachings. You can tell he took a lot of time to make the lectures and practice problems engaging. While the material was rough at first, it took some time to adjust to meet his expectations. Very accessible outside of the class and is super helpful in his office hours. You will learn a lot in his class. | Dr. Gu was a great teacher. He went above and beyond for all of his students with practice sheets, recording, extra materials, etc. His lectures were fast paced and sometimes hard to follow, however, overall he did a good job in answering questions. His exams were HARD, however he is very generous with the A cutoff. He expects a lot from students."
"Arnold, Eddy","For chem, not a bad professor. A lot of work and strict in some respects on grading. Details matter. | He is very knowledgeable and smart. Three seminar writeups and two presentations is not much to do for an A, but make sure you know what you are presenting very well because he might ask in depth questions that blow your mind. He was not super picky about attendance but pays attention to who is showing up. | Pick a paper that you know and understand and you'll be fine. Be able to explain every single figure, chart, and table within the paper, and know what the big picture is and the class will be a breeze. I skipped a bunch of classes, but one day (while I was there), he randomly took attendance, so skip at your own risk. | Worst seminar prof at Rutgers. Avoid him at all costs. He is so rude. He criticizes the presentation in a non professional way and interrupts the presentation in a rude way to ask questions. He doesn't even have guidelines or even show us the right way to present. I don't know how he expects us to present properly when he has high expectations. | i dont think he teaches anything else, but he's really nice and helpful. and unlike other chem seminar profs, doesn't make you do an insane amount of work, pretty easy going and understanding. definitely worth the 9 am class."
"Sousa, Maria","Best math teacher I've had. Makes the class very doable as long as you do the homework and study. | Solid professor. Calc 5 is a tough class but she makes it manageable. She provides a lot of extra resources for students to study and she uploads her notes online after lecture. HW can get very lengthy and difficult but the bottom line is, as long as you put in the work and pay attention in lecture, you will definitely pass the class."
"Goldman, Alan","Great professor; knows his stuff; is very charming and a good lecturer that knows how to bring a lot of conversation out of students. Homework was not particularly difficult but included projects that are insightful and enjoyable for the students. It's clear that he wants everybody to succeed. Highly recommend. | He is great. Easy A. Do the work. Easy Grader. Only thing is that you gotta go to class. You gotta go and talk. But that's fine because he makes the class discussion so engaging to the point where you want to speak up and say something. Seriously tho, *definitely* take him if you wanna have a good time, get an easy A, or fulfill a requirement. | The class is easy, but what makes it such a good class is the discussions. We talked about all sort of topics, and your participation in these class conversations make up majority of your grade. If you're going to take CMSI, take it with Chorun because the other professors make you read a lot. Overall, the best SAS course I've taken at RU. | Current Moral and Social Issues is a pretty easy A with Chorun, who is an easy grading prof who expects regular participation. If you like socializing, you will make this class more. Content material is light and typical for a 100 level course. Chorun has left political views but is open to all. Submit work on time!!"
"Izgu, Enver","The course itself is terrible, a lot of self learning. Izgu does care but I would take Sethi instead. She does more practice problems and always goes over what we will be tested on. Izgu had a lot of research slides and rambled on about irrelevant research topics we didn't need to know. Was a nice guy just not what you want for an orgo prof | This class is extremely difficult. Dr. Izgu does care and he wants us to succeed. He asks questions and provides us many practice problems. He used a chalkboard instead of the projector when writing down practice problems, which was a bit difficult to read and understand if you were sitting far. He explains carefully in a detailed way. | Orgo is hard as it is but Dr. Izgu really tries to make it relatable, interesting, and easier. His exams were difficult but he was generous with the grading cutoffs in the end. I highly recommend him because he honestly is a great teacher and advocates for his students to the chemistry department. | Dr. Izgu was the only professor in Orgo308 who seemed to care if you understood material and wanted you to pass. He did a pretty good job lecturing and his exams were better than the previous two. | This class is difficult, no doubt! I did not get an A and I struggled first. However, Enver is an amazing professor, making organic chemistry interesting and inspiring. He is on top of everything and very helpful outside the class. I feel like I learned so much with him and I changed my view on chemistry in a positive way. | Dr. Izgu is the best of the 3 orgo profs. He actually cares and wants students to be interested in the material he's teaching. His exam was almost entirely based on his notes, and the easiest one. Also, he would do everything he could to ensure we understood things when he explained them during class, even moving to chalkboard to draw stuff out. | He tries very hard to help students understand the material, but often goes on tangents and explains things for so long that its hard to see the point in what he is saying. He definitely tries his best to care, and he is more fair about exams than the other professors. He genuinely wants everyone to do well. | Enver is truly the only brightspot in this crapshow of a course. Unlike Boikess and Roth, he actually cares about his students and tries to be accessible outside of class. His exams aren't overkill, know your stuff decently well and you'll do fine. Actually tries to make Orgo interesting by showing you real world applications of concepts."
"Khan, Rohan",Best recitation Professor I've ever had. Made the class material way less intimidating | Very good teacher! Very approachable
"Young, Steven","This is the second class that i have taken professor Jones with, and this is the second time i have been let down. Most of the time it feels like he doesn't understand anything else that is going on with the class, he is just there to lecture and then leaves. I do no recommend taking classes with him. Pop health was a joke. | Professor Jones is very passionate about what he is teaching and his field. His lectures can be a little dull but the class overall is easy as long as you read the book and take the study guide seriously. He lets you out early. | Prof. Jones is a nice man who is very straightforward and easy. The class gets quite boring but he usually lets us out early. Skim the book, but focus on the notes and things that he stresses in class. Easy A! I definitely recommend this class with him! | Reas the book. If you read the book and memorize the terms know them word for word you will do fine on exams.He is bery boring and almost keep you for the whole double period make sure you bring a snack. Attendance somewhat help but that not that much."
"Remsing, Rick","Amazing professor. Had him for physical chem 2. His tests were very fair. If you show up to every lecture and stay on top of the work, its not hard to get an A. You will struggle if you try to cram."
"Khan, Sara","Professor Manuel is a good professor however, her exams can be tough. Some of the questions asked were very tricky. She is very stingy with the extra credit. For example, there are only 5 extra credit assignments. 4 are worth 0.5 points and the other (which is an extra credit paper assignment) is worth only 1% point. She's okay, but not the best. | Manuel is the best. I took her for Social and the class was interesting, though provoking, and easy. As long as you attend class, pay attention, and go over her reviews a day or two before the exam you'll be fine. She also drops your lowest exam grade INCLUDING the final. Great for mentoring and very knowledgeable. 10/10 recommend | Exams are HARD. She drops your lowest grade though so the final is optional if you are content with your grade (which I'm sure not a lot of people are). She is a very nice person and her lectures are funny but I would not take her again. Paid attention at lectures too so you get the idea. | Tough exams. You really, really need to study. However, she is helpful and her lectures are stimulating. She's also pretty funny. I recommend going to class and using the book as some of the content shows up in the exams and it can really help you in getting a better grade. | She's awesome | Gem. | very knowledgable of the material. Lectures are very long, but shes a good professor, Although the final was a bit tough. | Don't really need text, summer lecture stayed full 4hrs, otherwise content was all very do able | Absolutely awful. Does not know her stats and cannot teach. Easy A though."
"Depaolo, Patrick","Bless his heart. I was so worried for the math-related core requirement but this class was super easy AND I learned a lot. Saw him while I was waiting in a classroom for my next class to begin and he gave me mini cupcakes. Love you Pat. | He is a nice guy, but I don't recommend him as a probability teacher if you want to study it further. He only gave us easy examples and didn't ask much. As a result I wasn't well prepared for probability II and felt like we didn't cover many important concepts that we were supposed to cover. I would look for another instructor for probability. | this guy was my TA for linear algebra and he saved my semester im looking at a B+ or A and before i went to his office hours i might have failed. seriously the best | Low quality; too many antics, not enough teaching. | Very easy for 400 level. I failed this class earlier, but now I think I got at least a B+. He is very very easy. I didn't learn much with him but the class is fun. | This is my second class with Pat. I had him for Calc151 and soon as I found out he was teaching this 400 level probability class I dropped my other classes to take this class with him. He's the best instructor I've ever had. He really makes me excited to learn. Very flexible with grades and deadlines and he also gives extra credit. | The class was exciting! Instead of just lectures, it's a seminar in which students discuss the topics presented in class. Students were even allowed to vote on a topic to discuss. I loved the democratic structure of the class. He does assign short reading and writing assignments and likes that you express your ideas creatively. | Hands down one of the best professors I've had. He is excited about the subject, extremely knowledgeable, excellent teacher and a riot to be around. I thoroughly enjoyed going to class ever week, I highly recommend. | Pat is the best instructor you could possibly have. Very enthusiastic and tries very hard to make the material interesting. Very helpful whenever you have questions. Due dates are also very flexible. He cares more about students understanding concepts rather than calculating and simplifying answers. Take good notes and do the hw problems. | The best instructor I've had at Rutgers. Truly cares about teaching his students and will go out of his way to make sure you understand something. He makes some of the dry material less boring with his antics in class. All around, a great and funny person. If you go see him for help, you will clearly understand whatever you needed help with! | Extremely funny guy. Makes recitation interesting and learning math fun! Is there for OFFICE HOURS, gives review for final, even accepts late homework, overall great TA. Just look at his other ratings. Material is not easy! But with Pat anything is possible. P.S. There is BIRDS! | He was extremely helpful with all questions we had with hw and exams. It was also really passionate about math and had cool problems. His recitation was really fun and we had waffles on the last day! | He will answer literally any question you ask about the material. Makes sure you understand the material in office hours. He even brought in pancakes for us for the last recitation. He's easily one of the best TAs in the department, so take a class with him if you can. | Pat is the best TA I have had so far. He made multivariable calc so interesting. He always applied what we were learning to the real world. I was never bored in his class. He is funny and helpful and will always make sure you understand what is going on. Plus, he is making us waffles for our last recitation. Pat rocks. | Pat Devlin is hands down, the best person to learn math from. Hes human, he understands youre human, and will work from the ground up with awesome, enthusiastic examples and hands on help over and over for every student that expresses the slightest concern. If youre feeling advanced, hell throw neat math at you to keep you interested. The BEST!! | As a TA for Calc 3, Pat did exactly what a TA should do: Make the learned material more familiar with students, strengthen the understanding of concepts, and keep the class interested. Best of all: he kept the class lively with his antics, changing the way the student would view education. Hands down, thumbs up: the best instructor I've ever had! | The best professor I've ever had, very understanding and fair and reasonable. You will also learn a lot! I got an A on the final and I was in remedial math in high school, TAKE HIM! | Pat is awesome. He explains well, keeps it interesting and relevant, and wants you to do well. He says all the time, ""I'm on your side"" - and he is. He wants to get to know his students - if you have him, go to his office hours and get to know him, he writes AMAZING recommendation letters. | Had pat for Linear algebra and he is hands down the best math professor I've had, as an engineering major I've taken a bunch of math courses and never thought one could be both educational and entertaining, but pat pulls it off with ease. | Pat is awesome! He really knows what he's teaching and *really* wants you to learn it, too. He's on your side, and he'll do whatever it takes to help you out. | and i quote, ""'Hey you's guys; fun fact.' Pat is awesomeee"" truth. he REALLY wants you to do well. go to office hours. yes, it is true he makes waffles for you during the final. like angry birds? take his class. someone else wrote you can actually understand him... very true. math hurts, pat helps it hurt less. | This guy knows how to teach. I looked forward to coming to his lectures and was thoroughly impressed with his ability to keep student's attention. He's an all-around great guy, and I highly recommend taking his class. | Pat is the man! If you can take him for any course at all, DO IT! He really wants to see his students do well and he makes it known | Math 152 is difficult class. But Pat makes it easier to comprehend the concepts. Unlike other prof at RU, he speaks perfect english. Seriously, this guy is awesome. Take him cause you will not regret it. | Wonderful professor! He goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Although there is no curve he gives you options to improve your grade. He explains things very well and often gives you multiple ways to do it. One cool thing about him is he agrees the class is useless for certain methods he never uses. | Excellent excellent excellent instructor. | Pat, is an excellent professor, and you get to learn from him a lot, he makes calc really easy for you. In short - highly highly recommend him. | Amazing teacher. Worth taking the class just for him. He is a genius and you learn a ton. | The best professor i've had at Rutgers. He's a real genuine guy and wants to see his students succeed. He will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Attendance is mandatory and he gives non graded quizzes every class to check. Gives out a lot of practice exams/material. Give him your all and his will give you his. | Pat's Calc 2 class taught me so much about mathematics. His tests really prepare you for the material and the class is no BS. HE ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT HIS STUDENTS AND WANTS YOU TO LEARN THE MATERIAL AND DO WELL IN HIS CLASS! Go to office hours!! Great guy, please respect him. | Excellent teacher! He was always so enthusiastic to teach that it kept my attention in class. He teaches the material thoroughly and clearly and makes sure everyone understands. He is always willing to help as long as you see him after class and talk to him. Best math professor I have seen. :) | The best professor ive ever seen | ""Hey you's guys; fun fact."" Pat is awesomeee | Holds attention in class. Excellent speaker and very down to earth. Helpful outside of classroom. Tests are long, only from notes. | he is the best teacher i have ever had. his exams were not by any means easy but they were fair and he never put things on there that he did not teach. he makes everything very easy to understand and is so helpful.. always a mob of kids at his office hours, he cares a lot about his students and is an absolute GENIUS ..so glad i was able to take him | It's easy to pay attention in class with all his antics and that's all you really have to do to learn in Pat's class. He makes sure everyone is on the same page. The text book was only used for homework problems. The class is not really mandatory but there are quizzes each week and hw is due in class so show up. Also he made us waffles... | made waffles for us during the final"
"Gbolade, Omolade","She has a bit of an accent so it might be hard at times to understand, but her class isn't hard overall if you try. | A pretty solid class as long as you keep up with notes and read assignment directions very carefully. All of her tests are online and out of class except for the final. Be sure to copy down ALL the notes, as some of the questions on tests/quizzes are very specific to the slide info. Aside from that, she's a very caring teacher. | The textbook used was unironically written in 2003, so a lot of information is out of date. Each reading is 35+ of an awfully formatted book although it is free. She WILL copy questions directly to the tests but NOT include them on her factually incorrect slides that she does not update with modern statistics or information. Memorize the book. | She reads off the slides. Not super engaging, but the slides are fairly easy to understand. She takes attendance. She reviews topics before an exam or quiz so you will be okay. There is a book, but I stoped reading it after the 2nd week. Its not necessary but if you do get it, its an easy read. She has an accent but you'll still understand. | Dr. Owoleke was a very sweet professor. She did not really know how to use online tools like Canvas very well and she has a heavy accent, but she makes her class easy to take and she is very caring and considerate. I also took her for AVS 1114L for sheep unit (awesome). | Professor Atomre is very nice and makes this class very easy to understand. Attendance was required and part of the grade so make an effort to show up. The class itself was very easy, all the answers are in the textbook. Class was graded on weekly assignments, attendance, and exams, all of which were easy and very manageable. | Very caring professor but her accent is very hard to understand. Read material & Discussion posts r easy. Quizs/exams are all based on textbook or lectures. She will go over the material covered in the quiz/exam so be ready to take notes w/friend to make a study guide since the info is usually identical & you can ask her anything. Very accessible. | Dr. Owoleke is awesome. Her tests and quizzes were all online even though the class and lectures were in person. She has a very heavy accent when she speaks, but she is very sweet and compassionate and will go over the material if students ask to hear it again. I really enjoyed her AVS 1112 and AVS 1114L and I highly recommend her. She's goated. | Owoleke was a great professor. Class was heavy on slideshow-lectures. She was always available outside of class to answer questions, she is very understanding of the hard material shown in class. She does have hard quizzes/exams but she does review some of the harder questions a day before :) | A little unorganized, and not very specific about which information is important to remember and which is just supplementary information. While she was present during the labs and would provide support, most of it was taught by the sheep unit live-in student. Make sure to review material for the test. | Class is mostly of the professor lecturing. Exams and quizzes are kind of hard so definitely requires a lot of studying to do well on them. | She has an accent so its sometimes hard to understand what she's saying and she's also a little unorganized. She goes over the slides very quickly and you have to read A LOT. Quizzes and tests are pretty easy if you go over the notes and read the textbook. | part of three sections. she does have an accent but overall it is fine. I felt that I learned more from her assistants as they went into detail while doing the activity. tests are online after in person lab. you have a week to complete them | There aren't any ppts just a couple videos on each topic. She has an accent but you get used to it after a while and she gets easier to understand every class. Overall i would say pretty good ! | Easy class if you do all reading on your own. Lectures are quick, but Professor is very difficult to understand, both because of her accent and she's all over the place, doesn't seem knowledgeable. Beware with quizzes, her wording with questions is not clear most of the time. | Does not use PPT, instead has 4 or more videos to teach us. Quizzes are easy if you watch all of the videos, but it's kind of a pain to have to go back to a video to reference for a question. Gives short notice, puts the quiz up the same day it is due, so not much of a window to do it at leisure if you work (since most quizzes are due fri)."
"Rivera Rios, Jean","Joe is a great professor. He makes his classes fun and enjoyable while teaching us great information. Everything he has taught me about sports writing has been extremely helpful, and the assignments he gives out have also helped me learn a lot. I took two classes with him, and he was by far one of my favorite professors. | Class act! Great guy who is caring and wants to see the best from his students! He gets great bagels and munchkins where the Jets win | Professor Rivera was a great professor and taught me a lot about the journalism world. Brought in great guest speakers and was really helpful and accessible for questions. | Even though I had very to little prior knowledge in sports reporting this class and professor Rivera worked me with to ensure I fully understood the class and all assignments. The class is fun, engaging, and I took a lot from it even though I do not necessarily want to go into sports reporting. 10/10 recommend this class and professor | Great professor, great guy, great class. Can't recommend highly enough. Definitely take his class. | Joe is an awesome professor! If you LOVE sports, this is the class to take. 5-10 minutes before class starts we talk about our favorite sports teams and what's going on in the world. Plus he works for SportingNews so for anyone interested in becoming a sports writer, he provides a ton of insight and is a great contact to have. | Professor Rivera is so cool and very nice. His power points are really entertaining and have a lot of great content. He is pretty funny and cares about his students. He is always available to give feedback and really wants his students to succeed. I can 100% say that my writing skills are much better and I am very confident in my writing now. | Great course. Assignments are straightforward and the grading is lenient if assignments are done on time. If you like sports, I would 100% recommend taking this class. | What a guy. Prof. Rivera is super cool, would def recommend taking his class! Gives the inside scoop on all things sports reporting, so if you think this is what you wanna do, this class is super helpful! His class feels like you're talking to a friend about sports. Would totally take any other class he taught!"
