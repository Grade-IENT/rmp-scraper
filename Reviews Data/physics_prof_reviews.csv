"Hughes, John","He is one of the worst professors I have ever had which is a shame because this class is required. No one has any idea of what our grades are. He never graded any of our homework and assigned the class a 10-page research paper with VERY little guidance on what he was looking for. Great scientist, really knows his stuff but a horrible professor. | Physics 442 with Hughes is a nightmare. He didn't grade our homework for entire month - a whole month!! And then only decided to give us solutions to that homework less than a week before a midterm. Almost the entire class was completely lost because the course was being taught like a grad level course - do not take this class with him. Just don't. | Great guy, tries to make the material as interesting as possible. Although you only need an 80 for an A, you will have to put in quite a bit of work to get that. The clicker quizzes are pretty difficult. If you're just trying to fulfill a NS requirement, I wouldn't take this class. | Very nice guy. 80+ was an A. Tests aren't hard, and testbanks are online (for most of questions). iClickr quizzes on second of the two weekly lectures, so you can skip first. Puts up lectures online so not mandatory to go to first one. iClicker quizzes are kinda hard but he drops two lowest ones. Easy class to hit Nat. Sci req. | Solid professor. Make sure you make it to class on Fridays for the clicker quizzes, and pay attention/do the readings. The midterm isn't crazy difficulty, just make sure you do some half decent studying. Professor is cool, helpful, and isn't trying to make you fail. Not a bad class for an A/meet the Nat. Sci. req, just apply yourself a bit. | He is such a lazy professor, but explains things well. His lectures are really boring, and his quizzes are super easy if you just read the lectures. There is a quiz almost every week, but they're only 5 questions and most of them are easy. The curve for the class is insane. Easy A. Take the class with him!! | Awesome professor - very helpful and has such an incredible depth of knowledge in all areas of Astrophysics. Homeworks were fairly difficult, exams not so much. That being said, I have learned more in this class than I thought was possible. Would absolutely take more classes with him or at the very least recommend others to do so. | Very fair when it comes to tests, be sure to review his powerpoint slides. I-clicker quizzes come from the reading and not so much from lectures. Gives extra credit and curves. Fairly chill about attendance. Always willing to pause lecturing to answer students' questions. Highly recommend him. | Great professor. Material gets extremely difficult at the end, but office hours are helpful and will keep you afloat. Prof. Hughes is a cool guy too. A few tasteful jokes here and there and lectures aren't boring for those who want to stay and do well on quizzes and exams. I recommend this professor for any course. | sometimes condesending. exams are MC but very tricky. need to know stupid details. 80+ was an A but hard to get even an 80. read the book. his lectures dont really help but he gives iclicker quizzes every week so u have to keep up with reading. with some work an A is attainable | Great teacher"
"Jerez, Andres","This man is an absolutely terrible recitation instructor. On top of failing to review useful concepts with the class before assigning timed in-class work, he acted disinterested when leading the class and refused to give any useful responses to the questions we asked. What a pompous and arrogant man. Avoid at all costs or your grades will suffer. | If you have good memory this class is an easy A, otherwise, you would have to work hard. 2 exams but both are monitored so you cannot lookup answers. Homework assignments are pretty easy - just 10 questions per week. Overall he is good at what he teaches but the exams are very specific and you would have to memorize his lecture slides to get an A. | Okay, he knows what he's talking about. His lectures are just super dis-engaging and he only grades off of weekly homework quizzes (everything is on quizlet)- and two exams. His class isn't particularly hard but yeah- its meh- also would like to mention I took his class during covid so it was online. | The class is really interesting and Jerez is very passionate about it. He assigns about 1 homework every week and it's only 10 questions and pretty easy. He records all of his lectures and his slides are super easy to follow so attendance is not mandatory. One midterm and one final and you should get a solid grade if you memorize the slides. | Attempted to force proctortrack instead of attempting to find other ways to give exams, whether that be making it more comprehensive than pure memorization or even scrapping exams and doing collaborative projects that will demonstrate understanding. Exam was needlessly specific and just tested how well you could memorize, not what you learned | Professor Jerez is a good and caring professor. He is very interested in the topic of astronomy. If you ask him questions related to astronomy, he will be able to answer them very good and throughly. The topics that are taught in the class are very interesting to learn. | Professor Jerez is a good professor. He can answer any questions that you have anything related to astronomy. He is a caring professor. | Lectures were fine, but the exams were very detailed, and at times contained information one might not have from the lecture notes. Very easy to do poor on the exams as they are completely different than the homework assignments and contained random questions. Pretty much a hit or miss. | Hes a good guy, fun to listen to. I enjoyed the lectures alot, but his exams were miserable and not worth it. They werent hard, per se, but very specific about very random details. It was hard for me because Im big on understanding things rather than memorizing random facts and distances. Overall I was disappointed in the class. | Professor Jerez and I would often talk after class about the beauty of astronomy. He was very good at answering my many questions in class and I could tell he cared deeply about the subject. It was a great pleasure to have him as a professor. If you are truly interested in astronomy and engage in thought of any kind I urge you to take this class. | He is a very nice and funny prof. His exams are a bit difficult, but if you study, you will basically get an A. Also, and A is 85 and above, so it isn't too difficult to get an A. I do recommend that you go to the lectures because he explains things really well. | You must attend every lecture b/c he doesn't post his slides. Get ready to take pics of his slides if you're not a fast writer/typer. Easy homework, fair exam. Gives a good curve at the end. You'll get use to his accent. Overall, a nice professor. | Lectures are long, the most helpful study material is the book, which is clear and understandable. Homework every week but they're brief. The two exams are only have thirty questions each which is rough. Grading matrix is generous though and I ended up with a B despite getting 66.66 percent on both exams. Professor Jerez is excellent to talk to tho | Im taking this class as a STEM major even though the syllabus states it's for humanities majors. I disagree, I'm not advanced enough for the upper level astrophysics courses. This course is great, you scratch the surface on some really cool topics. It's a good if you want an interesting easy A, Jerez is hilarious & I look forward to this class a lo | One of the best Profs. I've had. | I have never seen such a disorganized professor in all my life. Took 40 minutes to go through syllabus, EXTREMELY heavy accent, and his slides are mostly pictures he took in his backyard. Made me not want to take this class. | Professor Jerez has his heart in the right place and wants to make class enjoyable, but his lectures tend to be dull sometimes. The book isn't expensive on amazon and his lectures follow the book, so read along and you'll be fine. Homework is a grade booster. Careful with the tests, though. Study for those. Not an effortless A, but a pretty easy B! | He goes right by the textbook, which is good in this class because he has a heavy accent so he is hard to understand at times. But, following along in the textbook is helpful. The homework is definitely a grade booster as well. | Professor Jerez is a great professor. He is a very nice guy, who tries his hardest to make the material digestible, interactive, and largely entertaining for his students. He's got a dry sense of humor. Go to class, the lectures aren't posted online. You shouldn't need to do much reading if you just show up to the lectures. I highly recommend him. | I took his summer class, so four hour lectures (he let us take 2 breaks a class) He knows his stuff and he's a very nice person. You need to make sure you copy down notes very quickly as he doesn't put his powerpoints online. Quizzes aren't too hard but not an easy A. Never used the book, got an A. Attendance is mandatory, because reading quizzes! | I don't know what to make of this class. I took it to get an A because it seemed easy and ended up with a C+, so this class ended up hurting me when I thought for sure that it would help me. Sure, the HW is easy since you can just find the answers online but the tests are extremely difficult and he doesn't really even tell you what to study. | His class is not as easy as it seems. The lectures see long and boring, but you could read the textbook to get the information. The homework is all on Quizlet so it's easy to get 100% on that, but the 2 tests cover a lot of material and are very hard if you don't pay attention. I'd say it's an easy B, but don't take if you want an effortless A | If you pay attention and study notes/Quizlet questions, this class is probably an easy A. If you're like me and come to lectures and don't pay attention, you can still end up with a B. His grading scale helps students. Would recommend for core curriculum. | Attended his four hour lecture sessions during the summer - EASY class. Yes, his lectures are boring, but the content of his quizzes and exams are so easy I never even cared. He doesn't even care if you show up late or at all in most cases. Only read the textbook if you're not paying attention during lecture - you'll still be fine! | Grea Professor; really nice and very willing to explain material. Best if you go to class, since he will be more likely to help you out this way if you need it, but it is not mandatory to pass. He has a slight accent, but it is not that noticeable. Material is very boring in lectures, but it sticks to textbook. Do well on your tests, and ur good."
"Cochran, Geraldine","Cochran is an amazing teacher who is very helpful to all students no matter the time or need. She is a clear grader and is very passionate about student learning and advancement. Recitation is of the utmost importance and will guide you through the class. Overall a great teacher who I wish to take again. | Very nice, not difficult. 10/10 | Professor Cochran is a great teacher and also pretty funny lol. As for the class, recitation is where most of the learning happens, because in the lecture it's mostly her just reviewing the main ideas and topics. | Cochran is a godsend, she is by far the best professor I've had. She made a relatively difficult class easy with great lectures, great exams, and plenty of opportunities to improve your grades if you are struggling. My only complaint is that the HW is graded for correctness with limited tries, but besides that this class was perfect | She was the best professor Ive ever had. She taught well and clear. There are opportunities for extra credit and her exams arent hard as long as you do the workshops and homeworks. 10/10 | Honestly, she's the best professor I had at Rutgers so far. After, our first exam majority of the class failed and although she didn't curve the exam she gave everyone another chance to retake the test. She said “If major of a class fails an exam I always say it's the professors fault” She wants you to succeed! | I had Prof Cochran for both Physics 115 and 116. She is still amazing. Highly recommend her to anyone taking physics. | If you are worried about Dr. Cochran being your professor as a student taking any of her classes and are looking her up now - please don't be. She's amazing. She personally reaches out to students who have trouble and does everything possible to make sure you pass as long as you do your assignments. Homework 2x a week online & workshop 2x a week. | Dr. Cochran is an absolutely fantastic professor. She is extremely caring and accommodating to everyone in the class. Her class is challenging, but she makes it fair and helps you as much as she can. She adapted the class to online learning very well. | Very good professor | I absolutely loved Dr. Cochran. She is witty and with it! She tells you exactly what she is looking for and doesn't sugar coat anything. | Love Dr. Cochran!!!! Amazing professor who is really passionate about what she teaches and brings in unique points of view into our discussions. Really understanding of our issues as students and tries to make the class as fun as possible. There are lots of readings in the class, but even if you skim them, just make sure to contribute to discussion | Although you will do more reading in this class than you will ever do in your life, Dr. Cochran is a great professor. She really wants to help all her students and will go out of her way to help you if you ask her to."
"Lath, Amitabh","If you love physics, maybe he'd be great, but for pharmacy students who have never taken physics before, it was hard to connect his lectures and the exam material. | I have never hated a professor until this one. I wasted hours of my life doing everything he told me only to watch videos for the final and having it being my best score out of all three exams. For all future pharmacy students watch organic chem tutor's physic videos and pray to your god because this guy will not help you. | Don't be fooled by the title ""Elements of Physics"" because two semesters worth of physics crammed into a single semester is a living hell, especially when the professor breezes through the slides with minimal explanation and shames students for asking questions. Aside from that, he doesn't even know the answers to his own questions on exams. | Physics is hard itself, but he makes it even worse. Went to every lecture and struggled through his class. I went to his office hours too and he straight up asked me if I have no common sense. There are cheat sheets for each exam, but he doesn't teach how to work through problems in lecture and expects you to learn how yourself, so nothing helps. | He is a very poor teacher, with an extremely smug and passive aggressive manner when asked questions. It is extremely disappointing for pharmacy students taking this class as a bonus, and we get a teacher with no understanding for the students. In lectures, he puts up a couple of demonstrations and then goes on to just read off the PowerPoint! 0/10 | Im not really sure what these people are talking about but this was one of the most boring, most painful, and most difficult class I have ever taken in my entire life. We're pharmacy students for christ sake, we literally couldn't care any less about physics, why make the test so hard that no one gets a 100 and the average is 50. smh x 1000!! | He is actually the best professor I've ever had for physics. He has a way of making concepts understood during lecture that I didn't think was possible. He does go pretty fast so read the textbook before class and also he claims not to curve the class, but he's also ok with everyone in the class getting an A and his hw and quizzes are easy. | This class was extremely difficult, and if it wasn't for the very generous final curve I would have failed that class. He is a relatively good lecturer, but often gets impatient if you ask too many questions. | Attendance isn't necessarily mandatory but going to class helps your understanding of astronomy more. He says things in class that aren't always in the book or on his slides that do show up on exams. Gives practice exams that are exactly like the midterm and final. He makes class enjoyable once he makes connections with his students. Fun class. | Honestly, astronomy made no sense to me. I got a D on the midterm and decided to attend class more and take notes. The notes barely helped but the practice final was exactly like the real final (not for the midterm though) and I got a B on the final. got 100s on the homeworks and ended the class with an A. Easy grader. | I'm a political science and history major, and have never had any proclivity for the hard sciences. But Lath is so passionate about teaching physics, and so good at it, that he managed to make physics far more interesting than many of my major courses. He's also hilariously sarcastic and goes on educational rants. | Professor Lath is amazing. Homework and the midterm as well as the midterm didn't seem to account for much. He truly wants all of his students to know and appreciate physics more and he wants everyone to do well. He comes across as snarky but he's the best. Please go see him, he might seem scary but he is a good person at heart and really cares. | Passionate about Physics 106. Great class, fun, informative, not difficult, easy to study for. Do the homework and labs and clickers and you'll be fine. Nice guy would can intelligently teach you physics in ways you can clearly understand. | Had him for Quantum&Atomic Physics. Simplified the concepts and made himself available for office help. Exams are straight forward if you attend class and pay attention to his examples. He can come off as sarcastic and condescending, but this is just his sense of humor, he is very willing to help you succeed. | Wonderful professor. Yes, very sarcastic at times. Sensitive individuals may feel insulted at times, but he doesn't mean anything by it. SUPER good at simplifying concepts, SUPER willing to help outside of class. Always says his wish is for every student to ace the course. | Yes, he can be very sarcastic and straight forward at times. That being said, he is a fantastic professor and an all around nice guy. I would recommend anyone to take all of the classes he teaches. | Prof Lath is such a great professor. Thermo is one of the hardest physics classes you can take as an undergrad and he was very aware of that. He makes himself available to his students. I highly recommend office hours he is very helpful not just with homework questions. I highly recommend him to anyone at RU. | I had him for intermediate quantum. If you have any problems see him in office hours, he is really nice and understanding. He is the type of professor that wants everyone to get an A. | The Greenhouse Effect class itself is pretty easy but Professor Lath makes the experience comically odd. He seems to have a vendetta against solar panels and every lecture seems to revert back to the fact that solar panels are so awful. Homeworks are pretty easy, especially if you take the class with someone. Exams are short and multiple choice. | Made mechanics understandable. Some hard material, but doable and he was always willing to help. Take home exams too which was a plus!!!!! | GREAT professor! The class is a little hard, but he makes everything really understandable, and really helps with everything! | Only take if you are very interested in the subject if your not choose a diff class! Lath came off to be arrogant and not so nice when you asked him questions. Greenhouse effect was basically physics mixed with liberal views on ""Global Warming"". Grade consisted of 2 exams, 1 cumulative final and a couple of homework assignments. Overall alright.... | I took his class with Prof. Lath after failing with a different professor. So with experience, I can say Lath is an excellent professor. | Lath, thank you for your support and your brilliance! | Lath is awsome! He is so helpful and really wants you to do well. He was my recitation instructor for Physics 203 and helped me improve so much. I went from a 53 on the first exam to a 93 on the second. I recommend him if you are willing to work hard and show that you want to do well. He is really there to help you. | hes ok | I hated physics before coming into this class, and I really struggled through 271, but Prof Lath was really helpful. I learned a lot, and I even enjoyed coming to lecture. He's a great guy, so as long as you're willing to learn the material, you'll do fine in his class. | Amit's a great teacher. His leactures are great and the class size is small. He really gets you to learn the material. I recomendation to anyone who is wiling to do the work. Grading is fair. I got an A. Best physics teacher... | Very matter of fact. | Amit's a good guy. Great lecturer, especially when he acts like an electromagnetic wave and walks around the lecture hall lol. Homeworks aren't too bad. Know your stuff and you'll do fine. Grading is definitely fair. I learned a lot in these courses, I feel he did a very thorough job. | Horrible! Have to re-take the course again. went on grad school interview and couldn't answer basic questions.tells students not to worry about handing in hw's, and grades - WATCH OUT. does matter. he grades based on what everyone else gets. take course in chem depart. | I liked him, he wasn't terrific but teaches well and I got A's in both, you just have to know what you are doing. | Decent teacher. Final exams count for sooooooooo much more than the insanely difficult noncumulative exams. | awesome prof...you guys prolly just couldn't cut it. | This class is ridiculously hard, even as a physics major, he made me want to change my major. Calc one definitely needs to be a prereq, not a coreq. He is not very nice or helpful...impossible tests | He's good as a lecturer, but he dosen't answer questions well. He comes off as consieted. | Nuclear physics. Doesn't care. Just there to put in time for tenure. Gave take home exam, most students copied from one another. Those who did not, totally destroyed their grade & did not forwarn them. SHould be fired. | Not the best teacher - not especially clear. when i went to his office hours he was very impatient and made me feel like an idiot. | Fails to give students a qualitative understanding of material. Never explains phenomena with physics- always math. often gives the impression that his own understanding of the material is not deep. | Smart teacher, does try to teach his students well, very confident, tests are hard, but course should be ok. | Don't know, I found his tests easy but none of my friends did. Basically, you've got to either have prior knowledge or really pay attention and do your work. It's not easy but it's not unreasonable either. | No Comments"
"Friedan, Daniel","Honestly, I'm sure Dr. Friedan is an intelligent man, and a nice guy too, but as a lecturer, he is grossly average. I took the class online during the COVID-19 pandemic, but regardless, the class wasn't too tough as I took physics in high school. However, the exams were nothing like the homework or quizzes, and requires a lot of outside studying. | He's okay. I took Physics 123 during Covid, so the classes were online. It was really hard to follow him. He would go through the math really fast and it was hard to understand what was going on. I tired so hard to follow him, but I just got lost five minutes in. The homework is so hard too, I don't know how I did it. It wasn't really taught well. | Overall, I think that Mr. Friedan is a great professor. I knows his stuff well, and as a result, explains concepts very well. All in all, I enjoyed attending his lectures and recitations. | Friedan is the reason why I would ace Croft's exams. More often than not, I would get lost during lecture, but Friedan would always clear everything up during recitation. Not only that, but he is always available during office hours and is MORE than willing to help. However, his quizzes are not easy, and you need to study for them. | Daniel Friedan is a cool guy but he's not that great of a TA. His handwriting is absolutely illegible can't even understand the physics bc of how fast and sloppy he writes and talks! Quizzes are given weekly in recitation and are difficult. You really have to self-teach. | Professor Friedan is the man. The sole reason I passed Physics 203 at RU. He is a recitation TA and he makes you think about the processes for a problem...he doesn't let you just plug in numbers to formulas. He wants his students to understand the concepts. If possible, try to go to his office hours! You won't be sorry!"
"Zamick, Larry","With the way this class is setup, it was great having Larry to guide you. He is so nice and helpful. | he's a nice guy. he doesn't teach anything cause thats the way the class is setup. however, as long as you really understand the concepts, he'll go easy on you cause he can tell you've put in some efforts. he's very fair. the only thing against you in this class is time. | This course sucks. The books suck, too. You don't learn anything, and he doesn't teach. Enjoy! | No Comments"
"Diaconescu, Duiliu","I got a 36 on the final and still passed with a B. Youll be fine if you do the homeworks and show up to recitation, great prof but tests made 0 sense-studying the material probably wont help too much but you get to make a formula sheet for exams. | Nice and understanding person with well-respected research but not made for teaching. Lectures were useless to me. Webassigns took hours but were helpful. To do well, read the textbook, go over the slides, do recommended book problems (make sure you understand them!). Before exams, redo hard book and Webassign problem, review concepts, pract. exams | He gives terrible lectures. The WebAssign homework doesn't help at all. The practice exams have many mistakes in them. You could read the textbook to study for exams, but the textbook doesn't give nearly enough information. So good luck passing this class. Fortunately, there is a big curve. | He just isn't a great teacher. He focuses on kinematics and then tests you on weird gas laws and torque. Curve is really large. Honestly, this class is a waste of time. Avoid it if you can. Also, I got a 50 on the final and finished with an A. Just goes to show you how the tests don't line up with the lectures. | I'm a very passionate physics major, but his lectures often bored me. The iClicker questions were pretty easy, but he never shows the answer distributions. His tests were all multiple choice, so there was no chance at partial credit. If I hadn't taken AP physics in high school, I would have really struggled in his class. Great guy, bad teacher. | A really nice guy and clearly very passionate about physics and gives great curves. On the other hand, he isn't great at communicating some of the more difficult concepts, possibly because he never had to struggle to understand them. Great demonstrations. | Professor Diaconescu is a very smart person, but he lacks the ability to propagate the information appropriately to his students. He is very helpful and will try to set up office hours for you. Also, if you get an answer right in his class, he will give you a bright smile that will light up your day. | You get relatively easy recitation quizzes and very easy iClickers. Then, all hell breaks loose when he throws you his super theoretical physics questions that have no real world application with no explanation. The one upside is the effort he puts into answering questions during exams. He leaps through the lecture hall just to get to you. | He's a sweet man, there's a great curve but he can not explain concepts clearly and for someone like me with only some physics background from high school this class was tough. there is no consistency with recitation quizzes, suggested problems and actual exams. Hardest class of the semester hands down. | very hard to understand and tests are difficult, but he curves very well. it's hard to not get an A and next to impossible to get lower than a B. attendance is i-clicker and he counts 75% attendance as full credit. | Horrible at explaining material. Overcomplicates lessons. You're better off skipping class and just reading the textbook. However, he is a master at the time derivative."
"Chandra, Premala","Professor Chandra did not teach well and instead I found myself self-learning everything. Same with majority of my peers. I read the textbook and took notes but since physics is such a hands-on course I found myself extremely lost. At the end of the semester I was less than a point from an A for my final grade but there was no curve | She's weirdly obsessed with Dave so you will watch some of his videos now and then. Overall, the professor wasn't the best in terms of explaining material so you will be self-teaching most of the info. However, she was caring in terms of asking the students for feedback. Participation is mandatory since there ARE clicker questions. | Attendance is taken by iClicker, which counts for a grade so you have to go to class. Zooms through slides and worked examples | she's rlly the sweetest human. she is rlly patient and is super understanding. she tries her best to answer all questions. read the textbook or go thro lecture notes b4 class. also do lots of problems b4 exams for practice. if u actually study you will get a decent grade. there r iclicker questions so attend class. | Really cares about the success of her students, although, her questions in class are much more rudimentary than the exam questions. | She goes through slides in 2 seconds and then gets mad when we do not understand it. Many times she got the problems wrong too. Very nice but cannot teach. | Premi is terrible plain and simple. Her favorite quote, ""Would you like to come up and teach?"" should be met with a resounding ""Yes"" from the entire class as my dog could do a better job teaching, if that's even how you can describe whatever she is attempting to do at the front of the room. Avoid at all costs. | Relatively easy class, but you need to have taken physics before. If not, all the information will fly over your head. Spends too much time complaining about how students are incompetent and talk too much, but could use that time for lecturing. Only reason I did well is because I've taken physics before. | Terrible excuse of a professor. Doesnt teach anything, just speeds through the PowerPoint (5 slides per sec) and then blames us for not understanding the material. If you even sneeze or blink too loudly, she will stop the class and ask if you can teach (you probably can). Spends more time trying to discipline us like high school students. | Gets confused herself about the material she is teaching and stops class whenever people are talking whether they are whispering or not. Proceeds to waste more time by trying get them to teach the material in an attempt to humiliate them and put them on the spot. | Easy grader and easy class. Gets very petty about people talking during class yet spends more time stopping class than actually teaching, also doesn't really know her material. | It was a very eye-opening class since it was about both the science and a little bit about the politics of global warming. VERY easy, 2 midterms (15 questions each) and 1 final (30 questions), hws are simple, uses iclickers as a proxy for attendance. And shes very nice too, always stated her faith and hope in our generation. | greenhouse effect is horrible. dont take it. she doesnt teach. maybe because it was her first semester teaching it. horrible!!!!! | She subbed for my physics professor a couple of times, and each time she was so irritating. In the beginning I liked her because she wrote on the board and tried to explain things more in depth than the ppt. However, she constantly goes on rants about people talking and wastes so much of class time doing so. It's very counter-productive. | Phenomenal recitation instructor. Everything I learned in Analytical Physics IIA was because of Premi. Goes over the material very well and quizzes are easy too. | Do your homework, go to office hours. Great intro to Solid State. Keeps us up-to-date with latest findings in physics journals | One of the best teachers I have had at rutgers. There is no reason not to do well in this class she will help you as much as she can. I studied hard and went to office hours and got an A | what an awesome teacher! the lectures were kind of boring, i admit. but you can tell that she wants everyone to do well and will help out in any way she can for that to happen. you can get a good grade if u just go over all the homeworks. take this class!! | Check back with me later. I just started the class and I like what I see. | What a great woman. I had her for modern physics and she made it a wonderful class. | I would have been screwed in physics (not the best of lecturers that I had), had I not had her for recitation. Extremely articulate, organized, and professional. Extremely helpful. She makes concepts extrememly clear. I was extremely lucky to have her. | She is awesome! Super helpful and very intelligent. Other people took this class with other professors and hated it...but everyone in my class loved her! Got an ""A"" in what otherwise would have been my most difficult class."
"Kloet, Willem","Professor Kloet is such a sweet professor. He is enthusiastic and gives demonstrations during class on the concepts. The grading isn't harsh and has a good curve. He is very approachable and wants everyone to do well. He is well respected by the students and his lecture notes are available online and cover everything you are expected to know. | Professor Kloet is a great professor. His notes are helpful as well as his lectures with demonstrations of physics concepts. This class is a pretty easy A with a heavy curve. It is intended as a basic physics course for pharmacy students and Kloet was a great person all around. | Kloet is the type of guy who definitely knows physics but can't teach physics. He teaches the pharmacy section so people do well simply because they are smart and put in the extra effort outside of class to do well, not because he can teach. He doesn't project his voice and can't see past the 3rd row for questions. There is about a 7-10 point curve | Prof. Wim Kloet was the best physics TA anyone could ask for physics recitation.. He's so kind and helpful..does an awesome job explaining the concepts taught in lecture and his recitation quizzes are very fair. He has an accent but its not too bad. Overall, he's awesome. Try to get in his recitation section if you can for 204. You won't regret it! | Prof. Kloet is the best teacher ever! He is the most adorable and sweetest man!! | An extremely helpful and nice professor. He explains the material well and is always willing to answer a question. A pretty lenient grader as well. | if it wasn't for this guy, i would have had no idea what was going on in lecture. explains the material way better than van heuvelen did... really he should just teach the whole thing... | This guy is excellent. He explains the material very clearly, and in a way that students can understand. He is very helpful and responsive to student questions. Take him if you can. Nice guy, good professor. | The guy called a question A Different Beast!! in his awesome accent of his in class....that alone gives him a 5 | most impossible exams given...practice exams are so easy compared to the ones he gives."
"Wakim, David","Nice & gave good advice. Made the lecture easy to understand. Exam is long & hard. He cut each PA by half compared to Fall. Made it half as much work due to class is half the time. Midterm was 3 hours and final was 4 hours; code(20-30%), mc(20%), short answers (30-45%), and long answers (6 sentence) (15-20%). The average was around 60 to 70%."
"Gentile, Michael","A breath of fresh air compared to alot of other STEM professors here. Extremely caring and compassionate person who cares about each one of his students. Never studied for a single exam and I got a C+ since there are so many other ways to raise your grade in the class. Lab resubmissions allowed, lectures and recitation had completion based grading. | Gentile shows genuine interest in physics, which I fully respect. His easy going attitude and fun lectures make the difficult subject of physics enjoyable, which is hard for me to say because I did not like physics at all in high school. He is very nice so I recommend asking for help after lectures and going to office hours. | Really good for the summer, class is pretty easy, lectures were long but digestible. You can talk to him after class and he gives great explanations for any topic, even if its outside the scope of the class | Best prof at Rutgers. Actually cares about you as a person first, student after. Genuinely wants everyone to do well. Exams were tough but didn't make up a big part of your grade. Has a heart of gold. Impossible to hate him. Attendance mandatory but if you have friends u can alternate. TA's are very helpful. Study hard for exams, but hes the goat. | Lab:15%, Recitation:10%, Lecture Tasks:5%, HW:10%, 2 Projects: 10% each, 3 Exams: 15% each. Lectures are recorded and uploaded along with his notes. He does random group tasks (GT) during lecture that make them ""mandatory"". GT are not every lecture. Labs are moderate and recitation is participation grade (so just attending gets you 100). | Amazing professor but you will hardly learn from this class and probably panic doing the practice exams. The grades for the exams are low overall, we go over concepts and barely do any math up until the exam. You have to teach yourself the formula's and how to use them. There is an index card for each exam and there is a small curve at the end. | 193-194 is not a good option for any student who is trying to get into medical/dental school and needs to take the MCAT/DAT. Lectures are spent deriving one equation but no practice problems. Recitation/Labs are poorly organized and the exams are just as confusing. If you're a pre-med student, steer clear of 193-194 and take 203-204 with Brahmia. | Lots of leeway when grading, takes into consideration exam difficulty and how the class as a whole performed. Plenty of opportunities to raise your grade with in-class participation, HW assignments, recitation grades, etc. Fun and helpful when explaining concepts. The class itself is time consuming but wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. | Not a hard class but a tedious amount of work. Does group tasks during lectures, which are submitted for class participation grade. Group tasks are not hard, and he gives you the answer right after, but this requires attendance. The labs are moderately hard but most of the time finishable during the 3 hours. Lectures feel and are super short. | Mike is one of the best professors I ever came across. It's very hard to fail to this class. This is coming from someone who did physics, only because its required by the major. His lecture and homework questions are very helpful in understanding physics. The Recitations and lab also very helpful. Great guy. | Professor Gentile is amazing. He is very enthusiastic about physics and he also understands that not everyone is so he does his best to keep things interesting. The course is not too tough and the labs can be lengthy but otherwise not too bad. | Exams are relatively easy bc of the notecard, lectures are recorded. Only participation matters in recitation but he's very caring and will accommodate you if needed. Getting an A is easy if you're willing to put in a little extra but not too much. | mike is a nice guy but the class is not it... the entirety of lecture is spent deriving an equation but we don't ever get practice applying them which makes tests 10x harder. lab sucks and so do the group projects. making attendance mandatory is annoying too considering lecture is not helpful at all. might as well have taken gen physics | This professor means well but there's a lot of tedious, busy work in this course. The TAs also are not always the most helpful and respond to questions we ask in recitation or lab with more questions. Nice guy, otherwise. Just not a fan of his teaching. | Had him for Physics for the Sciences. Mike is the exact kind of professor you want for a class that has to cover a lot of material. He's extremely kind and responsive to in lecture questions and emails, as well as just great at presenting material to the class. The class is really difficult but he makes it possible! | Mike is so passionate about what he teaches and making sure that everyone understands. He cares so much about his students and actually listens to their feedback. Lectures are super easy to follow and makes physics so much more accessible to those who don't have a super strong background in it. | Dude cares way too much about this class. I understand being passionate but he's constantly looking over your shoulder at what you're doing. Easy class but it's annoying and tedious work. | Some of the best lectures come from Prof. Gentile. Clearly shows that he cares how his students do in his class. Although, the course is exam/project-heavy, you will feel prepared going into them. | He is probably one of the best professors in the physics department and among the best lecturers I have ever come across. His lectures are interesting, inspiring, and he loves answering cool physics questions. I must say I hated the way they decided to grade the semester I took it, though- it was based overwhelmingly on ambiguous group projects. | Very kind and funny, obviously knows what he's talking about. A lot of ways to get easy points and as long as you understand how to do the practice questions posted before each exam you will be fine. | Michael is the best professor I have ever met. The set up of the class and his personality both contribute to how good this class is. It's not a cake walk, but he gives you all of the tools that you need to succeed. He is super fair. We all respect him tremendously. If you need help there's a ton of support, you can succeed if you try even a little | Show up to lecture , go to recitation, and do lab corrections and my man Mike will usually give you that A. The exams do get harder but Mike is a real bro and curves to help the class. He is also is an amazing teacher and is very understanding. | AMAZING! Mike was one of my favorite professor at Rutgers. He truly wants the best for his students and makes it so easy to get help and get a good grade! Only 60% of the grade comes from exams, while 40% is easy lab, recitation, and lecture grades. I wish all my professors were as great as him. | BEST PROFESSOR AT RUTGERS HANDS DOWN! You can tell this guy loves teaching and loves physics. Not a physics major but he makes everything interesting and easy to understand. He listens to you and respects students. Lots of opportunities to get good grades even if you do poorly on exams. Wish he was my professor for every class. | His lectures arent that helpful, but you have to go because he makes you hand in something for participation like half the time. Tests are kind of hard but count for less than half your grade so its hard to do bad in the class. | This man is by far the best professor I have ever had in my life. He truly cares about teaching Physics and it is important to him that students learn the materiand the best they can. He kept me interested in the subject the whole time and was more than happy to help students before, during, and after class. He should teach teachers how to teach. | Not just a great professor, but a great guy as well. Exams are hard but there's lots of other ways to earn credit (lab, recitation, homework etc). Do take him if you can for any class. | I took him over the Summer and he was a thousand times better than Brahmia; went from c+ to b+. The homework is actually interactive and I learn. The recitation is interactive and I learn more--10 pts (show up, do work, get 10 pts). Lecture has participation points. Exams, 6 questions, open ended-partial credit, need I say more. | Professor Gentile is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, however, his lectures do not correspond well with his exams. Spends all of lecture deriving equations but the exams are nothing like that. Did well on everything else (lab, recitation) and got 60s on the exams and still ended up with a B in the class. | Professor Gentile is hands down the best professor that I have had at Rutgers. He is excited about what he teaches and wants his students to feel the same way about physics. He cares about how his students do in the class and how much they have learned after taking the class. I would definitely take this class again! | Professor Gentile is great! I really enjoyed his class and I am not a physics major. He really cares about his students and gives you the materials and plenty office hours to make sure you can do well in his class. His lectures are great and he explains things very clearly. I would recommend going to office hours for help with the material. | Professor goes over the basic stuff in lecture but when exam time comes and you are given practice problems, it's hell. Not only are the problems way too hard, but the solutions are not detailed enough to explain the reasoning behind the work. Think of lecture as: ""What is 1 apple plus 1 apple"" and the exam 10x more complicated..... | Gentile is an amazing lecturer. He gets very animated and is passionate about what he teaches, making it easy to follow along. Go to class! No slides! I've seen several people saying beware for MCAT takers, but I disagree. This was the only physics I took as an undergrad and I scored very well on the physical science section of the old MCAT. | Let's be very honest right now. Coming from a student with over 120 credits, this guy is in the top 3 of all professors I've ever had in my life. And I'm not just saying that. We get it. It's physics. It's not easy. But, if you want to do well. I promise you that with gentile you will do well. Put in the time studying, read the book, khan academy. | If you've new to physics, this class is going to be really tough. He did not give a curve (to be fair he really couldn't, test averages were in the 70s overall). Exams are incredibly difficult. If you get full scores on everything else (hw, recitation, cw) and C's on the exam, you should get a B (45% hw+cw+recitation, 55% for the exams). | Good class. Lectures are actually interesting and well taught. A tad too conceptual deriving stuff however which doesn't correlate enough with exams (which are hard). The grading scheme for the course is awesome, other departments should take note from this course because this is a very student friendly science course. Easy B if you study for tests | Tests are a lot harder than what you would expect. Don't chegg the mastering physics because the level of difficulty for those problems is similar to the level of difficulty for the exams. Don't procrastinate. Don't have to do well on exams because he gives so much credit in other places (labs, hw, group tasks). | Go to class, do your work, take notes, ask questions. Correct mistakes. | Dr. Gentile's class focuses a lot on participating, ie showing up. There aren't any lecture notes online so going to class is recommended. There's a lot of group work, which is nice if that's how you learn (I don't learn well in groups) but he is straightforward about what is required and gives a nice curve. | Zero time in lectures going over any problems which made hw and exams very tough. Lectures were always interesting and kept my attention. But it was consistent deriving equations and not showing how to use them. Exams are very hard but he does give a generous amount of partial credit. Wants to see his students do well but you have to do the work. | Gentile is the man. Lectures are really interesting and he is great speaker. Bring colored pencils or pens to class because your notes have tons of drawings. You should not get anything lower than a B in this class. Super student friendly as long as you do the work. Really nice guy, extremely helpful. | 1. Clear logic 2. Patient Explanation 3. Motivational Lecture 4. Surprisingly Straightforward Exams 5. Has Humanity | BEAST. Great professor and extremely clear lectures and course layout. Taking him for summer gen phys 203/204. Showing up is 45% of the grade and 3 exams constitute the rest. He gives a VERY generous curve. Exams are extremely fair, do his practice problems. a lot of people dont use the book he wrote but i found it very helpful when studying. | Professor Gentile really loves to teach physics and the lectures were very interactive and interesting. He was very helpful and the class was great overall. Definitely take Physics 193/194 with Professor Gentile; you will learn a lot and understand physics. | Fantastic human being. If you show him you care about the grade and show interest, you can easily get an A | Hands down the best professor I've ever had at Rutgers. He makes the exams conceptual and he's a really fair grader. I learned more from him over the summer than in any class during the semester. Take him if you ever get the chance!! | He is the worst if you actually want to learn physics. Nice guy, but his class is all conceptual, and his exams are confusing. If you're taking the MCAT or like a straightforward way to do well, don't take him. | Very Easy to get a good grade, but I warn you against taking this class if you are premed and need to take the MCATs. His conceptual teaching style and the fact that you don't cover many of the topics on the exam means you will need to teach yourself the whole subject even if you wind up getting an A. Take 203-204 if this is you else take him. | He's obviously very interested in the material and in teaching it. He's clear and makes all of it very practical and easy to understand. Truly amazing professor! | Very nice guy who grades well"
"Chishti, Shumaila","One of the best professors | one of the best if not the best | Speeds through lectures, doesn't seem like he wants to be teaching, monotone voice. He is available after class if you have questions, only two homework's per week, I'm not a math person, but I rather take Rasiel as a professor then the others I've heard of. | This guy has no passion to be there. Monotone voice and sloppy hand writing. He will speed through notes and isn't very clear."
"Ruggieri, Charles","Ruggieri is an amazing professor who makes the class feel very straightforward and easy. Lectures have a perfect balance of notes, demonstrations, and example problems. All TA's are amazing and care about your success. Grading system is so forgiving that you'll only fail the class if you straight don't do any work. Rutgers is lucky to have this guy | Amazing professor, comprehensive lectures, and amazing TA's for recitations. Teaching actually goes on during class time and expectations on what to learn and do are very clear. Exams and Finals also are very close to the subject matter taught in class, so there's class is a fair assessment of one's competence of physics. | Best professor I've ever had. He makes physics interesting. I'm taking him again in the upcoming sem! I'm glad I have him as my prof. Def take him!!! | Professor Ruggieri is excellent! He makes complex physics easy to understand and genuinely cares about his students. He extends deadlines when necessary and keeps stress low with a mock midterm focused on comprehension. Recitations are helpful, and the homework ties concepts together nicely. Highly recommend! | Nice guy, really wants his students to do well in his classes, and offers many different ways to improve one's grade and understand the subjects deeper. | Amazing professor !! Great lectures and clear grading criteria. If you put in the work you can easily get an A. One of the best professors I have ever had. | Genuinely a good professor, especially compared to the other Rutgers professors, def recommend. | The best professor I have ever had. Gets his students excited to learn. Provides tons of resources to get better. Entertaining lectures and overall an amazing guy | Chaz is the goat. He provides a lot of study resources and is one of the most down-to-earth professors out there. His exams are also exactly like the review material and the class is very organized. | Chaz Ruggeri I would argue is the best professor at Rutgers PERIOD. Gives tons of help, is very structured, if i could take him every semester of my entire college career I would. GOAT Ruggeri should be his legal name. | Chaz should unironically change his name to chad cuz hes genuinely the best professor at rutgers, uncontested. My absolute goat | Ruggieri is by far, one of the best professors at RU. As a frosh engineer, having him for both PHY 1A and 1B, was amazing. He gives perfect organized structure for each week on the topic. Lecture attendance is not mandatory because he posts videos of him going over each slide in depth. Don't be lazy, put in the time and you are guaranteed an A. | Chaz is AMAZING. He gives countless resources to study from, so there really is no excuse to do badly in the class if you made an effort. His class layout is perfect, enough work to keep us on track but not an overbearing amount. He has great demos and sense of humor. I also think he makes the exams as easy as physically possible. You're chilling. | chaz SLAYED | His lectures are amazing, the HW can take some time but if you work through it with groups it helps, recitations are helpful too, his grading is leant and he ensures students can pass and learn physics well. | chill dude | Appreciate Chaz if you have the opportunity to be one of his students. His grading system is the epitome of the grade doesn't matter. The exam replacements make the exams less stressful, and he notices and rewards growth throughout the course. Do your work on time and ask as many questions as needed. | Chaz is a great professor who truly cares about his students - hard to find. He is easily to communicate with. TA's aren't super helpful, but LA's are! He provides all the resources you need to succeed. Lecture is engaging with demos and polling questions. | Good professor. Posts all lectures and slides online so you can always rewatch them. There's lots of work for the class. | I am so grateful for Chaz and his efforts to making physics enjoyable and easier to understand. Although his tests are difficult, he's always willing to answer any question. | I'm a freshman, and I honestly don't think that any professor I will have for the rest of my time here will surpass Professor Chaz. He's a chill guy, and his assignment scheduling and teaching style are down to clockwork. If you've had a bad experience with physics, know that Professor Chaz will be different as long as you put in the effort. | Chaz is a great educator and a wonderful boon to Rutgers' Freshman SOE curriculum. The homework can get tough, and the midterms are of high value, but your grade in his class will likely reflect the effort you put in if not more. He gives grade replacement on his final, occasional (albeit very minor) extra credit, and he's a joy to listen to. | Took physics123 online in fall2021. I paid very little attention to his zoom lectures but the course is actually so easy that everything just made sense when you do the recitations. Also before exams, just do practice problems and practice exams. Prof. chaz seems like a very nice guy and easy going. | Actual goat of Rutgers. Take this prof for analytical physics... you will NOT regret it. | one of my favor physics prof ever! he loves his students, caring and give well advices to us. take his class to be success!! | he coo | Ives amazing lectures, cares about his students a lot, especially during the online. This guy is totally worth it. | Best professor I had so far!! His lectures were not dry and easy to follow along. Homework were though sometimes unnecessarily difficult. Always gave plenty material to use and study before exams. Go to his office hours if you're having any difficulty he is amazing!! | A really great professor that I enjoyed having. He made physics fun and I actually paid attention to the lectures! Not too much hw; he gave a lot of review materials before every exam, and before the final. The exams were fine as long as you did his review materials and looked through his suggestions. Overall, he was really funny, and a great guy. | Chaz is one of the best Professors I've had at Rutgers! Very good lecturer and easily accessible. Chat him up and go to office hours/review, very helpful for exams, he'll help you with your grade, and he could be a great reference. Really a great guy | Big Man Chaz is hands down the best professor I have ever had for the Engineering Curriculum (and all of Rutgers for that matter). His lectures were hilarious and interesting. He is SUPER helpful and knowledgeable in his subject and is willing to meet you whenever it's convenient for you. His exams are VERY doable, study hard and you will do well. | Very friendly, spoke clearly and generated interest. I think that's the only time I can say that about an engineering course. | Professor Ruggieri is the nicest, most understanding, funny and overall fantastic professor I've had so far. From the first day, I knew I'd be fine in his class. Answers emails immediately, wants you to pass but in a way where you have mastered physics afterward. Professor Cochran, his split, is also fantastic! Take extended analytical physics! | Professor Rugierri is a pretty solid professor. I really love his demos in class and he goes in depth with his lectures so we can understand them better conceptually. He's a cool guy! | Chaz is one of a kind. He took over Prof Brahmia's class this year and it was his first year teaching, so nothing is perfect yet. The class quality overall was good. Honestly I sat in the front row and would sometimes fall asleep but its because of the material and not the professor. He truly cares for students and makes himself available for you."
"Eisenchmied, Alexander","i don't recommend him. he randomly selects a student to screen mirror their computer and puts them on the spot to figure out a code, feels like an attempt to humiliate students. his lectures are very confusing, most of the course is self taught. there's a lab and quiz due at the end of each week. he once took points off for not centering the title. | Very straightforward class and material. There's a quiz and a lab every week but the quizzes are taken from the book and the lab instructions are very clear. Sometimes his lectures were boring, since he just read from slides but he takes attendance. Can take a while to grade things, but he answers emails and gives you feedback on assignments | He is a really good professor! The workload is not bad at all and the exams are pretty straightforward. Only thing I do not like is that he sometimes picks on students to share their screens and do a coding exercise together. | Pichugin is a good professor! Attendance is mandatory but the class is pretty light and easy to get through. Assignments and classwork are easy. Sometimes will call on you randomly and ask questions but the content is easy. Midterm and Final are easy based on quizzes and class content. | Great professor, just don't come in to his class expecting to become invisible. He will call on you/put pressure on you to answer questions. Linux assignments were light both in-class and for homework. | midterm/final are the exact same as the quizzes online, and you can find the answers on quizlets. Pretty easy class, he was good and funny but he didn't answer emails after the first few weeks. Sometimes a little hard to understand, but as long as you kinda follow along you are fine textbook is online too, a lot of reading, u can skip it lowkey | Lectures were occasionally boring but also gave you a TON of useful information. Very minimal work required per week that wasn't too difficult (between quizzes and assignments in Linux). Pichugin was very helpful with anyone who had questions or didn't understand something. Exams were open notes. Highly recommend taking him. | he's a good professor, not a tough grader. | Looking at previous reviews all I can say he is a hit or miss. You can't get ahold of him after class. Lectures are a bit boring and you're better off learning alone. Previous reviews likely give a good rating due to possibility of getting a good grade is High. But I can say I didn't learn much from his lectures. | Amazing professor. Really confused about all the bad reviews. He is one of the best professors you'll ever take at Rutgers. Your literally guaranteed an A if you do stiff on time. If you have the opportunity, TAKE HIM!!! | Pichugin is the one professor that low-key just makes ur life harder than it has to be. He's nice but he's kinda passive aggressive. The class is ""easy"" if you just put the time and work in, the labs take some time to do so don't wait till last minute. | I do not know why there are so many bad reviews! Professor Pichugin was amazing, not only did he try his best to make sure that the class was interesting, but he was also extremely understanding and caring. There were days when I couldn't make it to class, and as long as I made up the work, he was definitely understanding. The class is easy! | The class is very lecture heavy but you can easily do well in this class by doing the labs. They take some time but have all the steps laid out easily. | Professor Pichugin is a very nice professor and really cares about his students. Although the online class is a little bit boring because he often talks for like two hours without stopping, the overall experience is great, and the quizzes are quite easy and the answers can be found in the textbook. Easy A if you follow the progress. | Genuinely the worst Professor I have had. He does not care about his students, at all. If you ask a question he treats you like you're stupid. He goes on long rants about things that don't matter and are irrelevant to the course material. Assigns irrelevant work. Save yourself the headache. Avoid this guy at all costs. | The class had to move online but I enjoyed it in person. Professor is really helpful. He is knowledgeable in several areas and he is enthusiastic about teaching. It really helps if you go to his office hours. The material is ok but not exciting. The assignments are long but easy. | Class was super boring, unemotional, and a drag every single lecture. He assigns the most useless and tedious assignments that are LONG and don't do anything but waste your time. He never emails you back too and doesn't post grades. Horrible class. | DO not take class with this man, biggest .... out there. Classes super boring, him just talking at you. Worst person on this planet. If you dare ask questions hes going to make you look stupid with. Has to much sass for absolutely no reason. Avoid at all cost."
"Rajabi, Samira","Professor Rajabi was very good at keeping a respectful environment and I truly felt like she enjoyed teaching and getting to know as many of us as possible. There were quizzes based on every reading, but we did Kahoot reviews that showed every question that would be on the midterm and the final, so they were super easy to study for. | Lecture was boring and didnt relate to recitation. Recitation Instructor breaks or makes the class experience. We have assignments every week but a lot of reading on top of it and when we find out about the assignment its only a week before. | Samira is the best professor I've had at Boulder, no contest. She is so intelligent and real, and makes you really care about the material she teaches. She's always available for feedback, and you will walk out of her class feeling like you learned a lot. 11/10 recommend | Professor Rajabi is a respectful professor, yet the class is dull and the material is duller. Unless you love media studies and analyzing every little piece of media from BLM to feminism, then skip this class. Assignments feel like high school projects, I finished the final project in about 45 minutes and got an A. Skip this class, it's not useful. | Samira Rajabi is my favorite professor! Want a fun class where you are required to buy the book titled, ""A*******"" ? This class is for you. I never wanted to miss her class because she was so engaging and interesting to talk about different ethics of media topics such as twitter and Facebook. DO THE READINGS, but she rocks and the tests are easy"
"Lee, Brian","Brian is a godsend. If you can find the time, take his office hours whether you have him for recitation/lab or not; he's a great communicator and is creative (and, not to forget, humorous) at teaching concepts that are understandable to the average student. | Brian is my Physics 227 recitation instructor. He is patient that willing to help everyone struggled with physics problems. He is good at interpreting hard physics or math problems in straightforward sentences which is quite easy to understand. Overall, he is one of the best TA I have ever met. Take him if you really want to learn. | While Brian might be a chill guy, he barely teaches you anything. That might work for some students but most of the time you're pretty much on your own in figuring out where you went wrong. He was also absolutely brutal at grading and to this day I have no idea what the criterion was. We did get a decent curve though! | Physics 230 is the Analytical Physics 2B (introductory modern physics) lab. I'm sorry that you were among the unfortunate crowd who had to take this course remotely. But all of the grading criteria were determined by rubrics from the course coordinators. They were all readily available. You admit here that you chose to read none of it. | Brian is the GOAT. He genuinely wants to help students learn and he also has a great sense of humor. He's able to empathize with other students and gives great feedback on labs. He is pretty lenient with grading, but looks for specific details within your explanation. I respect the f out of this guy and I hope I could play some League with him ;) | I love Brian. Literally one of the best Physics Lab TAs. He actually wants you to know Physics and will work with you to make sure you know what's happening. 10/10 reccommend | Brian is one of the coolest people on this planet. He is super down to Earth and is always willing to help you. He wants you to do well, so as long as you show up to class and do your labs, youll do well. His quizzes are really easy too, and he grades them super generously. Hes a legend. | This guy is the definition of a living legend! Like really, Brian is a really down to earth person and the most humble guy I have met at Rutgers so far. His quizzes and instructions are really easy and he wants everyone to get an A on the class. Best TA outta all of the TAs here at Rutgers. | Besides being a really helpful and insightful TA, he has an amazing (dry) sense of humor! Explained the labs really well, quizzes weren't too hard (some were a bit conceptual, though), and great at answering any questions. Pretty chill but at the same time very knowledgeable. | One of the best TA's i've ever had. Real fun, hilarious guy. Greatly enjoyed the Undertale themed quiz! | His use of English is fantastic and you're probably wondering why I am complimenting his English since this is a Physics Lab. He articulates and explains the concepts and instructions so well that its impossible for you to understand it. He will even word it in different ways and show you. Great lab instructor and I would definitely take him again. | Funny | Really fun and nice! His quizzes are straight forward and he tries his best to help everyone pass | Best TA I've ever had. Really funny and laid back. Impeccable english and helpful. Take him if you can."
"Wang, Hao","Don't take with this prof. He's a nice man, but not a great teacher. Makes you stand up and listen to him ramble for 30 min at the beginning of every class. Quizzes are impossible and graded super harshly. The lab reports themselves aren't too bad, they're the only thing that saved my grade. Good luck. | Overall nice person but horrible lecturer. Exams are tough so be ready to study. Class is doable but if you put in the work. | Dr. Wang was very knowledgeable about the subject of Pavement. However, it was a challenge for him to expand on practical experiences. A lot of work in this class. His homeworks were lengthly and sufficient time was often not given. His take home midterm took over my entire weekend. His project was only part that I really enjoyed about the class. | He is confused, mumbles a lot,talks too much about certain topics in class. He picks on students and is not a good not a good adviser. I would not recommend to a PhD. with him. | Hard to understand & he mumbles. But exams aren't too bad. Except the final, which was brutal. | Very helpful if you have questions. Attendance is taken sporadically. He goes over examples in class that are helpful for the homework and exam and can't be found online. The homework is graded and worth a good amount. | Prof Wang was helpful and welcomed students to ask questions after class"
"Mastbaum, Andrew","Great guy, easy to pass, hard to get an A | This was my hardest and most interesting MBA course. Professor Gates made complex math clear and relatable. | I thought this would be boring and it was not at all. The lectures were engaging and he is helpful in office hours and drops the lowest pop quiz. The problem sets were tough but the exam was fine if you paid attention | Amazing class! Intellectually stimulating, informal, relaxed environment got everyone to participate. No textbook or slides he just did everything on the board from his mind and made handouts after. Unusual format but it really worked well. Kind, funny, articulate, LOVES ECON. Long but fair exam made me realize how much I learned."
"Gershenson, Michael","He was so nice. Always cared for every student's wellbeing, talked to us about meaningful topics, assigned fun assignments, gave amazing and personal comments. Only thing is he made me more anxious about climate change lol. But he helped my writing so much, and made this class a breeze. | Professor Masiello is one of the best professors you could have for College Writing! I'm a reader, nor am I big on writing, so this was a class I was DREADING, but it was so fun. He cares about actually TEACHING his students rather than meeting the departments requirements. He's super understanding is more than willing to help his students out. | Professor Masiello is one of my favorite professors. Business writing is not an easy class, but he is a funny guy who does his best to make instructions as clear as possible. His feedback is very thorough, and pushes you to take your writing to the next level. Although the final paper is long, you're well prepared via earlier assignments. | He is big with reading, so you have to at least understand the text before writing your papers. Don't just pick a quote and try to connect it because he can tell whether you actually read or not. Also, his prompt questions have some difficult terms; can be confusing. If you end up taking him, I hope you have as much passion for reading as he does. | Prof Masiello was an amazing teacher to have for college writing. He always took time to go over the projects and make sure we understood even though they were a little tricky. Super caring and understanding too. Would definitely take his class again if I could. | FAVORITE PROFESSOR! I came into his class with severe anxiety of writing a 6000 word paper but Professor Masiello was extremely helpful in making it manageable. Very organized class, excellent feedback provided, and he truly cares for all his students. His humor always made me enjoy going to his classes too. TAKE HIM FOR YOUR WRITING REQ'S!!! | I loved Professor Masiello! He broke down a ten-page paper into manageable chunks and gave really good feedback on our drafts. He's approachable and gives you insights and texts to help you with your paper. The class wasn't easy, and you have to manage your time, but Professor Masiello did his best to make it as engaging and as possible. | As a writing tutor, I must say that Michael and his sister are assets at Rutgers' writing dept. You will be required to work on a semester-long proposal. It is not an easy A, and can be difficult for those who lack pro-writing background, but he is a great professor from every possible angle. Definitely an amazing experience to take it with him. | Amazing professor. He is always there for his students and is willing to help them regardless of anything. He is very clear with what he expects and how you can write better. Expos can be a hard class, but Professor Masiello makes it so much more bearable. Take his class and go to his office hours if you're confused!!! | Really wants you to succeed and is very supportive and understanding. If you need an extension all you have to do is reach out to him and he will work with you and do anything to help. Makes lectures really fun, even tho sometimes they run a bit longer. If you care about the class and will put the time and effort in, he will do everything to help. | Very caring and tries to make it fun | Sci and Tech Writing - culminates in final paper. Professor makes scientific paper reading and writing an enjoyable experience. He cares deeply about his students and wants them to succeed. I learned a lot about academic writing and learned how to break 15-page research proposals into manageable chunks. Would highly recommend taking with Masiello | Mr. Masiello was definitely the chillest professor Ive ever had. He really cares about his students doing well. He gives critical feedback on the midterm thats super useful for the final and is always available for extra help/questions. I definitely recommend choosing a topic that interests you so its not boring to write for an entire semester. | He expects you to know words and stuff. When you write words and stuff he tells you its out of order or something. its a tough class but i do have a better word order now when then i started so good that and yeah. class fun if you. | He is an amazing professor. Very passionate about the class and very specific in what he wants. Follow his instructions and you will do well in the class. It is crucial to pick a topic you 1) like and 2) able to do LOTS of research on, because the final 20 page paper is 50% of the class. He will go out of his way to meet you in case you need help. | Clear, perceptive, and super understanding. Like with any ""difficult"" project, if you're not willing to put in the work, don't expect a good grade. The work is time consuming, and he's a tough grader, but you'll walk away with a real skill if you apply his comments and suggestions, which he *will* take the time to share with you. | very unclear, not too happy about my grade specially because i have attended every single class. | Took it online. Hard class . Time consuming . Tough grader . Got a C after working my butt off | Prof Masiello maybe the best at rutgers, he has alot of patients and he is very very funny which makes class very very intresting and I learned alot. I take him for all my coarses if I could even my math ones haha! Srsly. | Amending my previous rating: Mr. Mike, or Indian-smelling hot guy, as we call him, deserves the best rating because he relly is into teaching you to be the best thing you can be. He is krystal clear and I once herd someone say he is as clear as Hegel on acid. I agree. I understood everything he threw at me. Take him now this moment don't stop. | Mr Mike is so cool. He smells like Indian food which I like but he cleans his beard well and no food hangs from it. hes super/dooper smart and will tell you all of the world that has happened since before you we're born. He will change your future and you're destinee. Just don't ask him to change your grade if you fail. Take him! Now! | This man is worth your time. He quotes shakespeare and knowns his stuff. Talk to him. He WANTS to help you.. just communicate with him what you're struggling with. two main grades: 15min oral pres, and 20-pg single space paper. i ended up with a solid A. because i talked to him and because he cares about people who care. | Smart. Down to earth. Understanding. BUT he's unclear, which is problematic - yet he genuinely tries to be helpful. It would have been best if he just handed out a syllabus or worksheet detailing assignment requirements instead of us having to take notes on his kinda vague verbal instructions. Ask him questions if needed & show interest in class. | He is an awesome teacher. Really down to Earth. He is really helpful when it comes to improving your paper; you just need to ask. You just need to come to class and listen to him, and you'll do fine. He is not an easy teacher, but he grades fairly. He is by far my most favorite writing professor. | Hands down one of the best professors at Rutgers. This man knows everything about everything. He's always trying to lighten the mood in class and crack jokes, and man is he funny! He's always there to help when students need it. He answers e-mails within a couple of hours. Very helpful, smart, and absolutely hilarious! | Made business writing fun. His speech is so elegant and flawless and he is very approachable. No one can get less than a B if you do the work | Best teacher I have had so far. Blows my mind how much he knows about Shakespeare every time I go to class. Breaks down the true meaning of each play. Also had for SciTech writing and although it's not his favorite, he taught it well and I received an A after a lottt of hard work. Take this class if you want to learn. Also, he has a sexy beard. | Masiello is so cool. he has his own life and he lets you know that. scitech is for science majors so its understood that english isnt your focus. only thing is hes kinda slow at giving back rough drafts of papers and he may say you did fine but he ll give you a mediocre grade so just make sure you get a second opinion. | None of this gushy ""let's talk about how this passage makes you feel"" sort of stuff. There is always a right answer for what the author means when they write, and if you don't know, he'll keep asking different questions until you understand it. Grading is HARD, but you really do get so much out of it. Definitely worth it for serious eng majors | His class was hard, but totally not boring. Mr Massiello was actually funny and his class wound up being my favorite class. ha ha I even memorized one of the poems cause I'm a dork and he made me like it. Good times. | Took Spenser's Faerie Queene with him, wish I could take something I'm more interested in. He is in my top 5 teachers of all time, an inspiration with his attitude and approach, and he cares about students like none other. Expect to work hard for his class, be graded fairly, and to learn a lot. *Angelic Choir* | awesome / inspiring class | Probably one of the most knowledgable professors at Rutgers, only problem is he expects his class to know as much as he does. If you do not have a pretty good prior knowledge of Ren Lit and the Bible, you might want to catch up on it before taking his class. He is very helpful, however, and if you work your ass off you might be able to pull of an A | I don't know what the previous reviewer could possibly have been thinking. Professor Masiello is amazing. He makes you work really, really hard, and he's a tough grader, but I learned more about poetry from him than I have from anybody else. | No Comments | Professor Masiello is the most intelligent teacher I have ever had! I have never learned so much in just one semester. Every word that comes out of his mouth shows his passion and his gift of teaching which he brings with this incredible enthusiasm in every class! | GREAT teacher. Very helpful. | Definitely one of the best teachers I've ever had. Knows everything and wants you to know everything. Very very approachable and willing to help. Has a ton of energy and is excited about what he's teaching. Really tries to help you understand. Great teacher. | This professor is funny, intelligent, and best of all he loves what he teaches, and that makes the work so much more fun and interesting. He is easy to get in touch with and will help you to succeed in any way he can. One of the best professors I have had. | The professor is young and energetic. Very smart and has the mastery of many disciplines in edition to Literature including Philosophy and is proficient in several languages. You will need to work in this class, but the payoff is that you will be better prepared for any other class you take at the university. Provides much help to student papers. | Well versed with an obvious love for Shakespeare. Informative about history and influences on Will. Amazing enthusiasm. Great class for Shakespeare lovers and haters. | GREAT class! Amazing teacher and enjoys Shakespeare as much as he loves teaching...definately recommend him! | Great professor. Challenging, but you will learn... or else. | Mr. Masiello's class was a joy. I learned more than any of my other English classes. Take him if you can. He's smart, extremely funny and always willing to help. He is one of the best teachers at Rutgers and anyone with a brain will enjoy his classes. | Mr. Masiello is the funniest, smartest professor I've had at Rutgers. The fools giving him bad ratings only reveal their own stupidity. He demands a lot, but only because he believes college students are capable of a lot. He knows a ton, and you'll learn a ton. Take his class! | I don't know about all these other idiots here but I had Mr. Masiello and he's awesome. Sure he's hard, but you also learn more in his class than in any other English class you're likely to take in the next 3 years. He's also very funny. Take him! | I had him and failed. Then took expos again, had the same level of work and got an A. Avoid him if u want a good grade | very into himself, thinks english is the most important subject in the world. I don't recommend him if you have a choice. | No Comments | He was very arrogant not helpful doesn't specify what he wants on the assignments...Hard to get a decent grade...."
"Rabe, Karin","Dr. Rabe was teaching Adv. General physics for the first time this semester and I'd say she did a wonderful job. Homeworks are super super tough, but that's what recitation is for. Only one exam and thats' the final, which wasn't too bad either. Homeworks are the hardest thing you'll encounter in this class and they're graded on effort! | Professor Rabe was amazing. Her lectures were really clear and she would always give clear responses to my questions. The homework was very very difficult but the tests were not even a tenth as hard as the homework. Even in an online setting she showed us video demos which helped us learn. Great professor, I wish I can have her for another class. | Professor Rabe is the best. She is so kind and considerate, best Physics professor at Rutgers that I have encountered. The class was online but she was so personable and brought the energy of the physics lecture hall into the zoom room. We even did demos like we normally would if we were in person. Top-notch alpha professor. | Professor Rabe is one of the best professors I've ever had. She cares about her students and tries to help them succeed, and she's passionate about her material. I wish that I could take her for every class. She makes very hard concepts seem more manageable, and she tries to make sure everyone in her class passes with a B. | Professor Rabe is a fantastic, passionate professor. She really takes the time to make sure her students understand material, and uses as many fun demonstrations as she can to allow you to visualize the sometimes abstract nature of E&M. The course itself is challenging by its very nature, and you may find yourself putting in long hours. | Professor is nice and caring but not a terrific lecturer (focuses too much on derivations). Exams were not bad, calculations were relatively easily but there are a few difficult conceptual questions so make sure to know the concepts and not just the calculations. Weekly homework, suggested problems, and old exams helped a lot. | Very good at speaking to a hall full of students, keeps students engaged and interested, very likable, will really help you understand the material if you talk to hear post-lecture or go to her office hours, which are made quite clear. The two midterms and final were of slightly above-average difficulty but curving is very fair. | This professor loves what she teaches, she makes sure you understand the topics and her powerpoints are mostly useful. Exams are not too hard, they are straight forward like problems done in class. Anything you don't understand will always be covered in recitation. | Lectures are a mix of theory and applications, and what she doesn't cover in lecture, the TA gets to in recitation. When asked questions, Dr. Rabe is very helpful and tries to make things as clear as possible. The exams are kind of difficult, but they're based on the homework and suggested problems she gives. | Lectures - Interesting but lacking real teaching, she touches upon very basic parts yet expects detailed understanding in homework, you either have to search the internet for answers or read the text several times in depth Homework - Rough, that's all I'll say Recitation - Where most learning happens, TA was pretty good | She was all over the place during and out of class. Never responded to any of my emails. Don't think I will ever see my final exam. | she is not helpful. | Good class. She's a sweet lady and is very helpful. She's also lenient with grading and gives a decent grading curve. | Rabe's a good lecturer. She presents the material slightly differently than the book so you can get two prspectives on the material, making it easier to learn. Plus she's real straightforward and uses experiments to intiguethe students while teaching them the material. | She's a decent professor, but it's hard to hear what goes on sometimes. Not because of soft speaking or heavy accent, but because so many other students are talking around me. If she was more forceful in shutting them up or by making lecture voluntary, class would flow a lot better for me and probably others. | very nice professor, grading is very generous too | Overall really nice and cares about students. If you ask her a question you will get a generally long answer that has extra information. She really tries to help but is not always easy to understand her point | Overall a very good professor. Her lectures are hard to sit through because of too much detail and she also stutters but she is very helpful on a individual basis and tells you exactly what she expects. The homework is somewhat difficult but is able to be worked through with some outside help. Overall an excellent class | Cool, nice. But I really don't like the way the exams are situated. You'd have to find where your seat is and that almost takes every student like 10 minutes. Very frustrating seating chart sometimes | Professor Rabe is very nice and helpful. The curve is generous and she goes out of her way to help you. Material is interesting and certainly relates to today. Old exams, homeworks, and cheat sheets help on exams. | She's a nice woman. The class is interesting but can definitely get boring at some points. She is pretty helpful and her homeworks and practice exams help with the actual exams. Her curve is generous. Take her class. | Amazing professor! She definitely goes out of her way to help you and make sure that you understand the work. The topic is interesting and you also learn a lot. Not too worried about grades so she implements a really generous curve - somewhere in the 80's starts the A range. Definitely take her! | Prof. Rabe is sweet. The class is pretty much the easiest college class I have ever taken. She is always willing to go out of her way for you. She definately explains things TOO thoroughly and it tends to make the class a bit boring."
"Townsend, Peter","Hybrid class, on line and at the studio."
"Mckeegan, Jeremy","His lectures are boring, you don't need the textbook at all, and he posts powerpoints online. You can do well if you study, but the class isn't as easy as people say. There's no hw, just 3 exams, and the final isn't cumulative. His exams are nothing like his study guides; use common sense to help you on exams. He gives extra credit for attendance | Was extremely disappointed with this course and professor. Took this course for an easy earth science course but it was the exact opposite. He does not answer his email whatsoever and does not even post his email on sakai. Nothing on the study guide is on the exam and the questions are very confusing. DO NOT TAKE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! | Took Planet Earth for an easy science core class but it was very hard. Lectures are extremely detailed and so are exams. Study guides aren't useful. Professor is passionate about what he teaches but unless youre extremely interested in Geology, do not take. Takes attendance but it turned out to not count towards the grade. | I took this class for an easy science credit course and it was anything but that! The exams are unnecessarily difficult and 65 questions each. The study guides he gives you have almost nothing to do with what will be on the exam. He says that attendance will count for 20% of grade but in the 2nd to last lecture announced it didn't count. Don't take | Had him for Planet Earth. Very unorganized and lectures are very hard to follow and pay attention to. Only 3 exams determine your grade, but fortunately none of them are cumulative. Also probably won't answer your emails. You're probably better off with the online version of this class. | Nice guy but his lectures are super boring. His study guides don't match whats on the test so just study his lecture slides. He lets you have a notecard for the test but it barely helps. You don't need the textbook. He doesn't respond to emails either so don't even try to email him with any questions. He only gave us an hour for the final. | Easy A IF you study. There is no homework or any other assignments, just 3 exams (final is not accumulative). You are allowed on index card (front and back) for a cheat sheet. Test is only on his slides which he posts on sakai, just study those and you'll be fine. His lectures are very boring and he can be a bit unorganized. No textbook needed. | He is a nice man but does not lecture well. In the syllabus it says that attendance counts but he later told us it counts for nothing. Exams are nothing like the study guide and very difficult/long for a natural science course. Was looking for a GPA booster but it proved to actually be difficult. Book is completely useless. Would not take again!!! | Delaney is extremely scattered. He gets sidetracked and confused during lecture and assumes we understand what he's talking about. Tests are nothing like the study guides he gives us and if you're not a science person they are difficult, even with the use of a notecard. There is too much material and everything is unclear. Nice man though. | Excellent professor. Charming accent, strong interest and experience in the subject, knows how to add some flavor to the lectures to make them funny and interesting. Great teacher, great class. | If I have to sit through another one of his lectures, I may consider suicide. Nothing he says is objecive. It is kind of a class on what he would like to find on Mars. | he is totally charming and goofy and the accent is really cute. the class, on the other hand, ehhh. he never used the book, don't bother buying it. he has the slides online so you might not evenwanna bother going to class. the tests were alright, some questions were detailed or worded badly. | super nice guy, but very goofy and hard to understand. I mean hard as hell, plus he uses all this moon slang. Don't buy the book, he never uses it, and make sure you know your stuff on the first 2 exams for the final, since it's the same questions! class is very boring. | Nice guy. Exams r easy only if u go to class because the questions r things that he says. Powerpoints r online but not helpful cuz they r only pics. Classes are boring esp on friday afternoons when all u wanna do is leave..sometimes lets us out early though. don't buy the book. Gravity always wins | Wonderful wonderful guy - has a passion for the material he teaches, and his lectures are easy to follow. Be sure to go to class and take notes because some of the material is too recent to be in the book. He lets you have a notecard cheat sheet for the tests. You'll love him :) | takes him about 30 minutes to get the computer started..its pretty funny"
"Geiko, Aleksandra","an apologist for communist genocidal activities | I took the HIS338: the Holocaust with Prof Pomiecko and absolutely loved it. My love for WW2 history aside, she has great lectures, loud clear voice and is very knowledgable about the material. Also has a nice personality, and includes jokes here and there to keep lectures from being boring. Would absolutely recommend this course with her! | Gave very long readings, 50 pages or more every week, explains what is expected for assignments and tests clearly, likes participation and gives pop quizzes that are difficult and wants very specific details about the reading in the answers."
"Kiryukhin, Valery","Teaches the course material well and gives thorough and interesting lectures. | He is one of the most wonderful physics professors in existence. He makes lecture so entertaining. | Very straightforward syllabus. The textbook is very helpful to review or catch up on lectures. Kudos to him for being able to teach with a broken arm on the first week. | Exams are graded tough, but there is a festive curve that comes into play at the end (which is generous). His lectures are predominantly theory and setting up problems. There are a couple examples. He doesn't do posted office hours, but the TA is usually helpful with questions. He makes students hand in hard copies of the homework in person. | So, Valery has super intense lectures, and kind of just assumes you have 100% grasp of the fundamentals before getting to lecture. Be ready to experience some math ""magic"" on the chalkboard. Take the class if you have to, but not if you can go another way. | 381-382 is a yearlong sequence. Clear, friendly, funny guy with crystal clear lecture skills. Problems are tough but doable, material is very manageable with dedicated effort. Word of advice: don't panic, and don't despair...keep up steadily and an A is certainly within reach. | he is a cute little man... the curve is beast but i hate physics so it was ok.. it did not turn out bad you do need to go to class for prs points and the things he does are pretty cool exams were a bit hard but like i said the curve is amazing | he does crazy magic during lecture. | Kiryukhin is the man. I never thought it was possible to get so much out of a lecture till I had him last semester. I was filled with joy to learn I had him again this semester for 124. He's partially insane and does awesome in class experiment demonstrations. | Well Profssor Kiryukin is a hard lecturer to keep up with because he goes through material like we know it already. The exams are really hard, but the curves are so good, you can have no idea what you're doing and get a B. That is...just as long as you cheat on the homework haha. I have to bare with him another semester so yay! | This professor may know his stuff, but he tends to blow through topics of physics, skipping over imperative details in his lectures. I go to the homework, and Im like....""uhh ohh"". The exams, in my opinion, were pretty brutal. If you have to take this course for engineering, go to Extended (115 - 115) instead. You get more credit anyways. | I enjoyed this professor, he kept some humour in the lecture.... and had a funny accent to boot. Never needed or used the textbook in his class, got an A both semesters. | AMAZING teacher! Keeps interest, wild demonstrations, very funny! HIGHLY recommend!!!!Uses own explanations and own examples nto illustrate points which in most cases are better than the book! His accent takes a couple lectures to get over, but is totally worth it! A++ | he knows what he is doing! | good fun teacher | Very funny; makes physics lecture somewhat enjoyable. | this guy is a easy teacher, wait till you freshmen ****s get to physics 2..say your prayers then | i like his teaching style of adding in jokes from time to time and the demos are informative. his accent doesn't really bother me at all. | He is a great showman. He risked life to show that air travels faster in helium. Thanks for not making the lecture boring!! | he wasnt that great of a teacher but the class was entertaining and the demos helped | Excellent Prof. Funny, entertaining but sometimes boring. Tests are a little hard, but the curve will help you alot. | Valery was an excellent professor that I enjoyed very much. | The best class I have ever taken, even thorugh I don't like physics. It is not the typical tedious class; this guy really knows how to teach. He looks like the typical crazy nerdy professor that makes class fun. Take you should definitely take this class. | Class is hard but curves rock, i thought i was going to fail...literally and i got a B | Had a good time in lectures...this guy has a quirky sense of humor. The exams, as others have said, are tough, but he lets you make a cheat sheet for them. MAKE SURE YOU WRITE DOWN ALL THE FORMULAS YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED! | he was okay, the curve helped a lot tho, exams were really tough | Funny little guy and he gets your attention with his demonstrations but when it comes down to it......he's not that great of a teacher and the exams are freaking hard! My final was a train wreck but luckily there is a huge curve. | This class was very entertaining. | he was better on ally mcbeal. | My favorite | Anyone who said they dont like this man, must have been sitting in the wrong lecture. He's very cool and approachable, can explain every element of his lectures to you confidently, and has the craziest cool accent ever. And its true, he does look like wolfgang puck. Great teacher, take his class. | He looks like Wolfgang Puck. His lectures are fun. | This guy can teach, great teacher, great lectures. He really makes the class fun and interesting. It helps that he really knows his stuff. He does present it hard but once u understand what hes talking about u wont be disappointed. | He shot a money out of the air with a metal ballbearing. Need I say more??!! But in all reality, he was hard as sh!t. Needed to read the book alot for his course. | i wish i could have him again next year he was so great...every lecture was a blast | he's puts on a cute show, but without his demonstrations, the class is extremely borning. Study hard for the exams, the prs is tricky but it doesn't count much. | hes got a cool accent but the class is so boring all i do is read the paper | great demos. Thorouh explanations. Very funny, how could a short Russian guy with his mannerisms not be. | Very easy, but a little boring | No Comments | Cool guy, some fun lectures, puts on a show for the class, actually learning something | No Comments"
"Chou, John","He did not know how to teach an intro physics course properly. He said homework should approx. take 8-10 hours per week. Exams were very challenging requiring excessive preparation in order to get at or above the 40% average. Took AP physics and still found it very challenging. Would not recommend for new students! Coming from a student w/ A avg. | If you're not very strong in physics, take 123 or 123H instead. 271-273 averages are low because too many are pushed into this fast-paced honors sequence. JPC is great and teaches well, but the broad, tough coursework causes struggles. There's a generous curve, though. If you're gifted and love physics, go for it. If not, avoid it. | (Honors Physics I) Horrible Professor, lectures were useless, the exams were nothing like the Homeworks like he says, and does no practice Problems at all. The exams are extremely hard, and even with prior physics knowledge, the exam questions are still difficult. The exam averages were like 40%,and lectures are extremely useless. | For Honors Physics 1, Prof. Chou is knowledgeable and helpful. However, the lectures are highly theoretical and we rarely went through practice problems, making the homework and exams very difficult. There is a curve at the end and I got mid to high 40's on the exams and ended with a B. Try to review calculus and physics before taking this class. | (Physics I Honors) Mr. Chou uses no notes for his lectures and explains things in a way that only Einstein would understand. The majority of the class leaves more confused than when they walked in. The average on the final exam was a 40%, if that says enough. Showing up to lectures is a waste of time. Accept your fate if you get him. | His class was amazing, but difficult. I had previous experience in physics during high school, which made his lectures very intuitive and the problems easier, but if you have not had that experience brush up. His lectures are top tier, and his knowledge is deep. He is always open to explaining concepts, and has humour in lectures. Amazing. | He is terrible | got an A and aced one of the exams, and i still cant follow his lectures. he moves very quickly at a high level w/o regard to what students do/don't understand. read the textbook and try to understand it deeply (if ur falling behind, preread sections before lecture to prime ur brain). then cram problems madly leading up to the exam, and pray to God | honors sec for 227 was hard, but chou made it doable. he speaks very theoretically and was kinda all over the place, but he makes the content seem cool. he's a very fair grader and reasonable person- he curved our class really heavy bc we all did bad on the exams and the final. it was his first time teaching E&M so he was just figuring it out too | Professor Chou is a terrible professor. Even if you read the textbook, attend lecture and recitation, do all the homework AND understand it, you still will do terribly on his arbitrarily difficult and misguided exams. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS | Not super easy or anything but he was so helpful and nice that I would give him a 5 even if I failed. Once we went online everybody got the iClicker points for free and exams were fair if you watched his amazing lectures. Man is a legend and his house tour after one of the lectures was the highlight of the semester. | Really good professor, tries to connect with students and illustrates difficult concepts very well. Really good guy all around and extremely knowledgeable. | Nothing similar between his lecture, homework, and exams. Nothing in homework covered in his lecture notes. Basically study by yourself. | One of the smartest professors I have ever had. He is funny and energetic and SO passionate. I took him for honors physics III and really enjoyed it. He is so good at explaining the difficult concepts and answers any questions you have. Even though the exams were hard because he is so intelligent, I learned a lot and am happy I took the course | Ask questions in lecture if you dont understand something. He once answered the same question three times within a few minutes. Workshop attendance is mandatory. Exam and quiz questions are taken from the homework, iclickers, and past exams. | Lecture is a great way to get extra credit. If you understand the book, you don't really need to pay attention. Exams were really easy (except the second midterm) and the recitations are decent. Overall, easy A. | Chou has by far one of the best voices for a physics lecture. So soothing and he's so easy to follow. Great lecturer and makes physics 124 a joke. Well physics is always a joke at this school, easy A bruhh | Good lecturers are hard to find but Prof Chou is def one of the best lecturers in the uni. Lectures arent even boring in his class. I learned a great deal and started to enjoy the subject more. He also has nice sense of style. | I actually really looked forward to lecture-- he goes through the material clearly and will explain if people have trouble. Also, the demonstrations were always awesome. I highly recommend taking him if you can. | His lectures are great. He goes over the important concepts that will show up on the exams. His i-clickers count as extra credit towards your final grade. Got a low grade on final exam, but still passed with a B | J.P. Chou is a good lecturer. You can tell he's super intelligent but tries his best to dumb things down to teach. I learned a lot in this lecture, and obviously you've gotta love the phys lecture demos. | The previous comments are accurate, but the rating on helpfulness needs to be higher. | He's a nice guy, but he assumes you know way too much. The final was impossible, if you want to do well you need to study everything every week. Other than having to put in a lot of time, not that bad."
"Lee, Sang-Hyuk","This man is very boring. The exams are hard as hell for no reason, and he asks the most specific questions on them. I studied so hard, and his tests are unfair, and his lectures will put you to REM sleep. The topic is interesting, but he somehow makes it a drag. Don't take him!!! | Took him for Modern East Asia and it was a blast. He is incredibly knowledgeable and has a pretty entertaining lecture style. It's a history course so it is dense, but he makes the material easy to digest and he has a great sense of humor. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the area. | Lots and lots of readings were assigned. Seemingly a caring professor; however, it isn't easy to get a hold of him if you have questions. Also, I only knew my grades trajectory at the end of the class, adding to my college-induced anxieties. | A good guy and pretty good professor, it is clear he has a lot of passion for the material. The class can be a bit dry at times, but if you are interested in the subject it should still be engaging. The work consists of a few 1-2 page response tests and a midterm/final exam. Overall, easy class as long as you study terms and do the papers. | Professor Lee's lectures were intense but illuminating. His breadth of knowledge is impressive, and some anecdotes he provides about historical events are quite funny. His work, when he does assign any, is relatively easy but thought-provoking and analytical. He also appears to have an affinity for Ralph Lauren jackets and sportcoats. | He is a nice professor. Don't expect this class going to be easy, this is a college-level of history class. One thing I think he should make improvements on responding and checking email frequently. You know what he graduated from Harvard. He definitely very knowledgeable, but I recommend people who passionate about history take this, informative | love this man he's literally the cutest professor LMAO. don't expect classical asia to be an easy A. it's history, there's gonna be a lot of memorization (which most people here don't realize). you don't need the textbook, but i personally thought it made the class easier. midterm and final were an essay that we had 24 hours to write. | Best class online! I wish I could take it in person as well. Professor Lee is great and his lectures have all the information you need for any assignments we have. Everything is straight to the point and the mini papers we get are not hard at all. The readings are all relevant to what we are learning. Super positive and passionate about Asian hist. | I love Professor Lee. He is evidently passionate about Asian history, and he seems to be a very caring person who wants to see his students succeed. He's not the best at working canvas, and sometimes you can miss an assignment he posts, but he has been very understanding about missed assignments and other mistakes. Great professor. | He doesnt respond to emails. Doesnt explain assignments. Doesnt post assignments on the schedule. Doesnt post any documents or files that would help with assignments explaining what to do. No clear grading criteria. Lots of readings that you gotta do on your own with no help. I honestly cant say enough bad things about this man. Hes no help. | Not a difficult class, but get ready to memorize terms and people from the handouts for the exams. The handouts are your study guides. There were also two quizzes and four response papers. Not an easy A, but you can earn it if you put in a great amount of effort. | Thought Classical Asia was an easy class but was wrong. you have to put effort/memorize a good amount. The lectures are really boring unless you are actually interested in Asian history. Discussions were pretty interesting as they are based on stories. Prof was p chill and funny but sometimes hard to understand. Not an easy grader as well. | good dude, he's caring and dresses hella clean. his korean accent is not terrible and you can understand pretty clearly what he says. for the exams, review all the key terms on the handouts he gives you each lecture because the exam (besides the essay which he gives to you) is basically those terms. record the lectures cause sometimes hes confusing | Professor Lee is a great professor and is clearly knowledgeable on the subject, my only complaints are with the structure of the class which can get a bit dry as all but two or three classes are lectures | He's very kind and caring towards his students. When I took Classical Asia with him and mentioned to him my love for literature, he even suggested different books which fall into context with the syllabus, like The Tale of Genji. He's the man for any Chinese history class, although I wish he taught a separate course for Japanese and Korean history | Professor Lee is an expert on the subject, but sometimes, the criteria of what we would be tested on would be a little unclear. That said, he is a very nice man who just wants you to understand the material. I would say it is easy to pass, but an A will take some extra effort. | this professor is good enough to make me go out of my way and tell potential students they should take his class....enough said | Personally I like this professor but the grading and the way the course was structured may need some adjustements. He said it was non-cumulative but added some materials from the past (quote identification). And the first exam was graded in a very strict manner. The final exam was also very tricky. I just hope i can get decent grade. | He probably should respond to email. Sometimes students have to send important messages or papers to him and as students we get nervous when professors don't reply. | He's an ok prof. He definitely does know his asian history well. But I felt he was somewhat strict in grading my test and paper. I do feel i know more about asian history than my other classmates so i was shocked when some students did better than me. So i have this weird suspicion he graded me stricter. But i could be wrong. lol~ But a decent guy. | such a quirky, adorakable guy. his accent makes you laugh sometimes, and he pronounces all the names in the 'proper' way (read: the non-american way), so sometimes it's hard to follow if you haven't done the readings. with that said, if you read the textbook and skim the additional readings (and attend class) you'll be fine. he's so helpful/nice! | I took 2 classes with him in one semester. The classes themselves were great as I'm a history major and love asian history. Attending class was a drag as his lectures are hard to follow but everything he talks about is in the readings and he really assigns some great reading material. Plus he gives out lecture outlines with ID's and main points | Great Prof! Really passionate about his subject and very clear about what he expects on exams. Was not interested in Asian history until I took his course and found it to be one of the best history courses at Rutgers. | Great professor, totally passionate about course material, wants you to do well, encourages active participation in discussions. great accent. lectures could be dry sometimes, although he has a very quirky sense of humor that occasionally surfaces...overall, gives the sense of a good person through and through | He's really nice and tries to make the lectures interesting, but he couldn't... classes are boring and sometimes he couldn't understand students' questions... besides, he didn't gave us back our papers' grades until the last class... grade is based on participation, four short papers, midterm, final and book review. | Passionate about his subject, tries to make class interesting, easy to understand despite his accent. Is an easy grader if you just go to class and takes notes, he has these nifty little outlines with all the IDs on the midterm. I had no interest in asian history before him but i'd totally take another one of his classes. great prof! | Very good guy, and is not a bad teacher either. Is passionate about his subject matter and is a fairly lenient grader. Make sure you come to class and take notes and you will be fine on the exams and paper. Otherwise you will be stuck reading through the book all night | He's totally into what he teaches, but he's rather boring. I love Asian culture, but my focus is Japanese... More than half of this course is Chinese history. If you don't like Chinese philosophy, don't take this because a lot of time is spent focusing on it. | No Comments"
"Blumberg, Girsh","He's more assertive and direct than most Canadians - there is kindness in that. If you're expecting everyone to handle you with ""kid gloves,"" you might wanna reconsider choosing therapy as a career. Since, by his own admission, he teaches the class as if his students are planning to train as therapists, he's doing his job turning some people off. | Incredibly disorganized course. I've never taken a course where to complete weekly assignments, I have to review content that is supposed to be 2 weeks from that date. The weekly quizzes would be on one week's material while the assignments are on totally different material. Incredibly confusing and making this course more difficult than it should. | I love this professor. I have had him for two classes, history of pysch and counselling, I enjoyed both. Students have commented, saying he's rude, he's not. He is just straight to the point and some students can't handle that. Participation matters and slides are great study guide. Also gives valuable career insight in class. | His class is very straight forward and he doesn't overload you with unnecessary information. Workload was minimal and he uses real life examples to explain the material which was helpful. The final is worth 50% but it's easy as long as you take notes during class. | this prof is the worst... first day of classes he told us that if we didn't have a profile picture on zoom we would be going to hell... not a good first impression. other then that his tests where a piece of cake as he copy's verbatim the questions off of quizlet.. took ages to get my final grade back though | There were 6 midterms every two weeks, and one cumulative final exam, all multiple-choice. Dr Blumberg lectured pretty quickly but if you focus in class and take good notes, you'll be fine. He also posts the PowerPoints before class so you can take notes on your own time. | Good lecturer and relatively easy A+; half the mark is participation and weekly online quizzes which basically test to see if you're doing the readings and attending class. Final exam is multiple choice and straightforward. Definitely worthwhile if you want to do clinical as Marc has years of experience and ties in a lot of anecdotes etc. | Well put together powerpoint lectures. Straightforward quizzes, discussions and 3 midterms. I enjoyed the material, Marc is a good lecturer. | Not only did this professor not do well with teaching relevant material, there were times where he was very rude and discrediting towards people in the class and their questions. There were many people who did not want to ask him questions as he would call them out and make them feel inferior. I learned more reading the textbook and slides myself. | Dr. Blumberg is not everyone's cup of tea - due to his occasional outdated opinions and loud manner, but his classes are fairly easy. Although he does not give a clear grading scheme, if you show up to class and ask questions/share opinions - you will receive participation points. All weekly quizzes and exams were MC and you get plenty of time. | I understand that it's difficult to keep an online class engaging, but this prof doesn't even try. He's extremely rude, often embarrassing students for asking simple questions. Makes you watch 45 min videos just to ask one question about it on the quiz. Reads slides and always rushes through lectures. Easy to pass the class but you learn nothing. | He was my yr 1 (intro evolutionary psych). Im in my 4th yr about to graduate and I still talk about things I learned in that course and from him. Cool prof enjoyed every minute of this course. Criteria: weekly quizzes online 10-20 questions and a midterm and final. All multiple choice, the book explained perfectly everything tested & in PowerPoint | Any class taught by this prof can be better taught to yourself via a textbook. He teaches advanced courses as though they are 1st year courses; if you want an easy A, he's your guy! If you want value for your money, go with someone else. He puts in the minimal amount of work possible and is not open to being challenged. He is, however, accessible | Marc is an okay person but not a good professor at all. He is priveleged and does not care about his students. All tests are tough multiple choices and his lectures are just copy paste. Further, he posts too many videos for only one irrelevant question to come in the exam. Honestly, just dont recommend him at ALL! | I took this class because i love evolution and psychology is my major. class is good, but he is EXTREMELY unclear for what he is asking for. Does not tell you what to expect on test and demands you take notes during all 80 of his videos but doesn't specify whats important. Good/interesting material is all i can say. | Blumberg has so much experience in the field and it's evident when he teaches. He includes so many stories and videos to keep things interesting. A generous marker, extremely fair, a nice man overall. I would definitely take classes with him again! | He's an amazing person and makes lectures really interesting with his use of personal anecdotes (this man has lived 100 lives). I've taken him for 3 courses (History, Counselling, Community). DONT MISS HIS LECTURES. His MC tests tend to be a little confusing and full of typos but he offers extra credit if you don't test well! | Very boring lectures. Reads almost everything off of the slides and puts most of the class to sleep. Almost half the classes are videos and movies you could just watch at home and make me regret coming to class. I find it impossible to pay attention when I cannot keep interested. I like the topic but he teaches it very dryly. | Wonderful man; cares about the success of students and the field of psychology as a whole, he is also accessible out of class. With that said, 80% of his lectures were unbearable - and he's so nice that it hurts to even say that! I was very interested in the subject but struggled going to class to listen to him read of slides I could read myself | Honestly a really great guy. Weekly online quizzes were easy if you read the material. He can be passive aggressive when people comment on how he does things, but most people (in my class at least) didn't do the readings and would complain it was too tough or too much work on top of a full course load. I entirely disagree. He was super nice! | First class at SMU so dont have anything to compare but Blumberg really seemed to know his stuff. Made the material fun and easy to understand. Really made me think about Psych as a major. | Dr. Blumberg used personal/professional stories about his experience in this field. Found this very interesting and valuable. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about his current and previous work, which makes it easier to learn form. Don't expect a fast response to emails, but he did give up his personal cell # - told us to call not write | Lectures were great. Love the incorporation of video clips as well as integrating life events in lectures. Really enjoy the class structure and exams straight forward. Would take more classes with Blumberg if it wasn't my last year. Only bad thing was very fast paced, but still manageable. | If he likes you, he'll treat you well. If for whatever reason he decides he doesn't like you, he's dismissive, condescending and passive aggressive. I am really not enjoying my experience in his class. | Dont take a class with him in winter if it's 8:30. He refuses to come in if there is snowflakes falling. Twice the whole class was waiting for him and he didn't show up. He's not respectful of the students time. He has great knowledge and hopefully will improve on his lectures the next time. It is an interesting course. He's very disorganized. | Very considerate and wanted us to succeed. Gave extra credit when he saw the test marks weren't good. If you don't like multiple choice exams don't take this class. Gave various opportunities for bonus points even on the exams themselves. Told stories and showed videos to make the material more interesting which really helped. | I am really disappointed with Mr. Blumberg as a professor, his teaching of History of Psychology is a joke. He flies through his ppts so fast that you have no chance to even read what's on the slides or take notes, doesn't respond to emails containing important inquiries about the class, and doesn't seem to care about individual students at all. | Pretty good prof, although he is clueless when it comes to technology. He gave us weekly lecture quizzes which were widely based on the lectures. He doesn't put a lot of effort in his course and evaluations are always multiple choice! | favorite prof at SMU, have taken 1220 and 3307 with him and going to be taking his psyc history class this summer, super nice, you respect him and he will respect you, interesting lectures, lots of movies/clips, overall nice guy and if you go to class you should be good.. got at A in 1220 and an A+ in 3307 | Best teacher ever! Must take his classes | I decided to become a psychologist because of him! Very helpful and will often accommodate ( if you need to take an exam earlyer or latter). Took every class he thought. He is easy going , knowledgeable and funny. Best teacher I had at SMU. | 2nd time w/ him. Much better at teaching hist than origins of evolution. Really great at giving lectures, makes boring material bearable with humor and vids. Also gives bonus quizzes + in class activities. Gives pointers of what will most likely be on test so attendance is a must. All around great prof. Tests decent but you HAVE to study. | Second class I took with Blumberg, but I liked him a lot more this time around. He was funny and has interesting stories that relate to the material. If you go to class (bonus points!!) and do the readings you can do well. Paper is not too bad if you follow his instructions. Evening classes felt long but he usually ended class a little early. | Took PSYC 1220 - Evolutionary Psychology. Blumberg is a nice enough guy and has some interesting stories from his time as a lawyer. Not the most helpful prof ever, pretty slow when it comes to grading and posting marks. Grading is based on 2 tests and a research paper. He can seem a little rough around the edges and doesn't put much effort in. | Puts the minimal amount of effort into his teaching. Putting minimal amounts of effort into this class yielded an ""A"". Go figure. | Took his behavior problems in children course... Classes were interesting enough and he is a cool guy, but his tests are very very difficult.. Mark was made up of 3 multiple choice tests and not many people did well. Definitely needs to reevaluate his testing. | *Sigh* Never again. If I have to delay graduation to avoid his class, so be it. | Some of the reviews are surprising to me, I have taken two courses with him and both I learned a lot from. One based on the textbook chosen and two because he talks so much about his personal experiences being a psychologist. He tells how his practice is and what he does to treat people. It's awesome to hear about if that's the career you want. | Faculty like Blumberg are the reason why a lot of people call Saint Mary's University ""Robie Street High School"". If you go to his classes, he rewards you with marks. But he can't teach very well. I now rearrange my classes to avoid sitting in his. | I really liked Dr Blumberg. It is a rather easy course, and he's probably nicer than he should be, but if you go to class, and do the work you'll learn a lot and enjoy it. If you go and nap, you won't get anything from it. He's a clinical psyc, so shares his experiences, and uses a lot of movies/clips. He likes his courses, but is very disorganised | Syllabus stipulates that he doesn't respond to emails so those upset over that are just stunned. Makes boring material interesting. Infuses humour. Tests are hard so that you have to *gasp* apply yourself to achieve your university degree - shocking!! :P Great guy - go to class, if for nothing but the extra credit points. | I highly recommend this guy. Just make sure you attend class and listen. He has some very interesting stories. | Marc is without passion, conviction and calling him a ""lazy professor"" is a disgrace to the title ""professor"". Easy grades is all he's good for, though he seems to think he's funny too. Disorganized, inconsistent, condescending, late for class, quizzes are on-the-cuff and silly....Profs like him are the reason why your degree isn't worth much. | I took biological orgins of behaviour. He was awesome, tests were easy, very funny, would definitely take other courses with him, very laid back. | Classes with Blumberg were immediately regrettable in terms of the educational experience. I've had 8 years of university level classes and Blumberg represents my least inspiring, least enthusiastic, teacher to date. He gives everybody good grades, but nothing more than that. He did nothing to help students engage the subject matter. | Considering the dryness of the material, Dr. Blumberg kept the class very interesting. His experience as a practicing clinical psychologist is very valuable and gives you perspective about the field. He is quite funny.his slides are very clear. you have to pay attention to the detail he puts in them though. one of the best profs I EVER had.5 stars. | Made dry material interesting. Tests can be tough. make sure you study the text thoroughly and the powerpoints, unless otherwise instructed. Take good notes. | Terrible Prof. He always late for class and/or cancels a lot of them. If you write your exam in the atlantic centre, then he'll post everyone else's marks except for yours. He doesn't go pick them up right away, so he doesn't mark those exams until everyone else's are posted. If you email him, he won't get back, and he wont meet in person. terrible | Awesome prof, however, he doesnt reply to emails. very lenient. 1 test & final exam 35% each which were pretty straight forward once you studied. paper is 20% and attendance/participation is 10%. interesting class as well. i got an A. | Just show up to class for the attendance points and videos. To study, just read the chapter summaries. If you've taken an evolution class before you'll get an easy A. Great prof in all, but he's hard to get a hold of out of class though, and somewhat disorganized at times."
"Schnetzer, Stephen","An honest legend of Rutgers Physics. Easily in my top 3, can't think of anyone better. | The grading policy is very lenient. I ended up with an A, but to be honest came away not really understanding physics. It seems like it's mostly equations being put on a board, with not enough attempt at helping students to really understand the material. Retakes on every quiz though, and participation counts for 20% of your grade. | This professor is simpling amazing, when he graded the homework. Every one get full score as long as you did it?And the exam is paragraph question which is easier than multiple choice?I think everyone can get A if you go to every class?You must take this professor if you need 21th century challenge requirement. Most important, he looks so cute. | He is a pretty good professor - he did seem to go fast at times but it is really due to the way the course has been set up. He does a fairly good job with helping students to understand the necessary equations but he could definitely be more clear with some of his instructions. Takes clicker attendance so it is mandatory. Use old exams to study. | Greenhouse Effect: Not bad, since the midterm average was low he offered an extra credit paper for 25 points onto the midterm grade. Homeworks and iclicker questions made up a lot of the grade and were pretty easy. Interesting course material as well. | I have this professor for Greenhouse Gases, sounds like an easy class? right? Well guess again, his midterm was 20 multiple choice questions,where the class average was a 64 .. he wouldnt cure the midterm. Hes hard to understand during lecture so he just keeps going. To much information crammed into one lecture. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSS !!!!! | good teacher, enthusiastic about the material, will go over all the stuff you need to know for the exam. as long as you do the work its a piece of cake | He tells us to just accept what he's presenting without explaining why sometimes. Crams too much into lecture, with many mistakes in notes, and there is too much material. The problems we are required to know how to solve are given step by step instructions. Class seems to focus more on memorization than understanding concepts | He tries to fit too much into the lectures and usually goes over class time. The material is not clear, but that might be just that it's that hard! He's very likable. | Honestly, he is not a very good instructor in 273. I am straight A students who love phsycs (major in physics) and has 48 AP credits. Although I Aced his tests, I did not really understand a thing in full depths. I found myself memorizing things rather than understanding things. He is a cool guy though. | this class is so hard. the lectures are impossible, and so is the homework. Your only hope is to study with a whole bunch of your friends. He can't explain anything. He was enthusiastic about choosing this really unfriendly black and white book, which is impossible to read on your own. pick someone like kalekar if you value your grade/sanity. | His helpfulness depends upon the day. He is enthusiastic about quantum but tends to go off on tangents beyond anyone in the class. When he stays on the level of the audience, he is good. Other lectures you might as well skip cuz you wont understand a THING. He once caught himself having spent an entire lecture describing equations in Calc. 5. | very concise and clear. he is the best physics teacher i've known in my life. | explains things fairly well... sometimes he confuses himself. knows his stuff | very intelligent. great teacher. a++++ | Excellent recitation teacher. Does a great job helping you understand problems you don't get. Strongly recommended. | Relies too heavily on Powerpoint; gotta learn to do homework problems on your own. Exams not too hard and a hefty curve means not too many grades below a B in his class. Lectures really boring. | Decent class. Be nice if he didnt screw people onthe E/M final though. | good guy | Amazing. Class is fun and interesting. He helps you understand the material | (Science=Physics)Bookish but focused. Great presenter, Clear."
"Podzorov, Vitaly","Awesome class, lots of overlap with modern physics, and you can definitely tell when he is teaching in his own expertise area (organic semiconductors). | So 326 is a lab course and Podzorov is a hard grader. The labs are extensive and the course my be easier if taken with one of the TAs. On the other hand, Podzorov is a great professor and will take the time to answer your questions. He peppers in extra credit during the lectures and there are occasional quizzes during class. Attend lecture! | My favorite Pro in Rutgers. Good lecturer. Prepare for pop quizzes, week homework, and give an amazing presentation. | He is awesome and his class goes over a lot of fun stuff. Although there is only really a paper and presentation for this class, there are also a few quizzes and home works each week, but they are just a few questions each time. Mainly focus on your presentation and paper. One again, he is awesome and a really cool guy, probably the coolest ever."
"Buckley, Matthew","Great professor who clearly explains all topics covered in class. He also makes it clear how the class will be curved. For homeworks he does not explain where you lose points which can make it difficult to figure out what you did wrong in your work. | Professor Buckley is a very good professor. His lecture slides are very useful. Most importantly he is very approachable. His classes are just awesome! | If you are looking for an easy science class to fulfill your SAS core curriculum requirements, look elsewhere because Astronomy&Cosmology is not it!!! While Professor Buckley is a great guy and some of his lectures are pretty cool, you get graded on your responses to clicker questions every lecture and his exams are tough as well. Not an easy A!!!"
"Wu, Weida","Very organized, follows the course textbook very closely and has the best lecture notes (textbook worthy) which supplement the book very nicely. Practice exams are a really good indicator of what to expect for the exams. Challenging but rewarding course and grades fairly. Problem sets can get quite lengthy though. | great professor. He creates computationally difficult test questions and makes a class very competitive for an A although he does curves well. His style is realistic, college is supposed to prepare us for the real world and I think his class does well in this regard. If you enjoy physics and an intellectual challenge take his class. | Nice man, not a good teacher. The leacures mostly consist of long-winded derivations on a blackboard with barely audible commentary that does little to illuminate what he is doing or why, The homework looks nothing like the exams, and he uses higher-level math than the corequisite math-course. Most people did poorly in the class. | He is a very nice man, but honestly a pretty boring lecturer. He tends to overcomplicate much of the content more than necessary. The homework was also extremely easy, and the midterm and final were extremely difficult. This made it very hard to study for exams. | His lectures are rambling and often spoken softly into the board. You might as well just read the textbook instead of attending class for 381, that way you might actually learn something. | Physics 381 is a hard class and you must prepare yourself for at least an hour to understand and engage in the lecture. Besides from being really knowledgable, Prof Wu cares about students and is approachable during office hours. While his accent is sometimes incomprehensible, his lectures strictly follow textbook. So just be prepared and goodluck | Physics 381 is actually not that difficult since there is really a big curve I guess. I get an A with 80 out 100 total score. He is very helpful. I just hope he can give more practice problems for the exams. Good overall. | I don't know why I'm writing this; it's not like the phys dep't gives a choice in professor. Anyway, people hate his lectures, but what I hate was the structure of the class. HW is not like the exams, so the practice exams are the best way to study, but many of the solutions he gives to his prac. exams are unintelligible and riddled with mistakes. | He is very bad at lecturing. You might decide it's not worth going to his lectures. He has very detailed and useful lecture notes that he puts online. His tests are pretty hard, but if you study the practice exams and the example problems from the lectures, you should be okay. | His class is very easy, but it takes a lot of time to type the lab reports. Be aware of lab! | He explains what we need to know, gives a quiz or assignment and that's it. Sitting in his classes is lackadaisical and the lab assignments are not hard at all. Basically, he's the most basic professor. I wish his classes were a little more interesting and I wish Wu was more passionate about teaching. | Had him for Thermal and Computer based. He is a nice person, and he is willing to help you if you reach out. The language barrier is really difficult at times, but if you put in the effort you can get an A. I predict he will get better with time."
"Salur, Sevil","Professor Salur is a really good professor for electromagnetism 1 and 2. She is a really caring professor who wants the students to do really well. She knows the material really well as well while she is teaching the material. | great professor that really cares about their students. | Class was about as good as you could expect from an electromagnetism class. Homework and lecture content are quite difficult, but the exams themselves are much easier and focus more on solution techniques than calculation. Class was well-handled considering the virus situation. | Had her for a seminar on the Big Bang. The 3 hour format was rough but she tried her best to keep us awake. She was super enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The lectures were basically recaps of the book. The writing assignments were very easy, especially for an ""honors"" class. Would recommend if they offer this interdisciplinary honors seminar again. | Sevil may not be the most skilled lecturer, but she is extremely willing to help answer your questions and have a conversation with you. Overall her class was very straight forward, with no tricks and a generous grading policy. | Ms. Salur is such a sweetheart. But the class is fast-paced and it helps if you've had exposure to physics in the past or else it might be a bit challenging. She's really generous with the curve though and she builds in some stuff (iclickers, HW, etc) to help with your grade. | Sevil is an absolute sweetheart and is ridiculously generous to her students. It takes genuine effort to fail this class with her, or to even get anything worse than a B. She's not really the clearest lecturer and she gets mixed up sometimes, but she's comprehensible and always seems enthusiastic about what she's teaching. | She is a great lecturer and very willing to help you during office hours. I have really enjoyed attending her classes and would highly recommend anyone take her if they can. Also, the cutoff for an A is pretty low, so it's not hard at all to do well as long as you pay attention and do hw. And you even get to drop a bunch of grades at the end. | With no physics background in high school this class was pretty tough. Fortunately, there are a lot of points to be obtained from homework questions and clickers. Quizzes can be hard, and exams are ok. I managed to get an A, but overall I thought lecture was not helpful and I had to struggle through the material myself to do it. | Clearest and most helpful science professor I ever had. If you do the reading ahead of class and the homework ahead of recitation, you should be on solid ground. That being said, the quizzes are very rough. The curve for an A is 85% with a strong class. Prof. Salur is very enthusiastic about teaching and friendly individually. HIGHLY recommend. | She is an excellent professor. She explains well, gives fair exams, and curves generously. She is very helpful and very accommodating regarding rescheduling exams. Make sure to take the honors section if you can in order to have Salur. | Rutgers makes it so that if you only took 1 AP physics test (in physics C), then you have to retake physics 1. I imagine the class would be extremely difficult if you have 0 physics background from high school. But if you know physics already, then you should be fine. Her enthusiasm is also pretty cute I find it funny | She's actually a very easy and fair teacher. The curve isn't bad. She also really has a passion for physics and you can see that by her enthusiasm during lectures. If you're a physics major, I strongly suggest you take the honors section of 271-272 with her. It's worth it. | Had her for Honors Physics I. It was her first time teaching the class, and she put a lot of effort into it. I'm horrific at physics, and this course covers way too much stuff, but she made the class very laid back. Exams weren't too hard and there was a massive curve. My exam average was around 60% and with hw and quizzes I was able to pull a B."
"Oh, Seongshik","This guy was tops in my honest opinion. Definitely challenging on many levels, but I was due for it, and many of you are too. | Once upon a time my classmates complained to me about their TAs for Physics 203/204. You cannot compare their efficieny to Professor Oh's. He does Online Homework Problems in class and the recitation quiz is a modification of the completed problems. He's helpful and has a nice butt. | One of the worst classes I have taken at Rutgers. | Terrible professor. 40% of the Midterm was on a topic we went over once in passing. The homeworks have nothing to do with anything, the midterm and quizes were completely different then anything we ever did in homeworks. I sincerely hope that he is not a professor at Rutgers after this year."
"Jackson, Rebecca","Not a typical lecture class. Just need to follow the assignments that are posted on the web and you will do fine. Dr. Jordan really seems to care and she is very approachable. The class is not really a science class, but I wish the dummies that could never understand photosynthesis would have stayed out. | She is soo nice and down-to-earth. This isn't your typical boring, lecture class, you do something different every week. There's a bunch of fun guest speakers, lots of fun group work, science experiments, you get to go outside, go to Rutgers gardens, etc. The hw assignments are easy too. You don't have to be a science expert to like the class! | She's a WINNER | Dr Jordan is a great teacher who focuses on student needs. Take her if you have the chance. | Dr. Jordan is the best professor in the department. Take her if you have the chance. | I had her for teaching environmental science in the classroom. A great class for potential teachers, shows how important and tough it is to incorporate the environnment into programs...but possible. She was fairly new when I took the course but assured us she would keep the things that helped us the most in her future teaching. Very easy assignm | Great class if you want to be a teacher, not just if you want to teach about the environment. Lots you can use in the class. Dr. Jordan tries hard to gear the class to student needs. This can be a problem: some kids don't care about the environment and don't really want to teach. This is a constant RU problem-some students don't belong in class."
"Chant, Robert","Professor Laugwitz is a very caring and intelligent professor. His Lin Opt class was structured very well, and his exams were more than fair. Take him if you want to learn and have a not so difficult time. His lectures sometimes were a little hard to follow, but he was able to answer all questions. Overall, an awesome professor, glad I chose him! | Pretty cool prof. Is definitely able to explain stuff clearly and is very organized. Also always willing to help. | He's lecture is very detailed and he is very patient. Tough German grader tho but if you follow his hm and get all the incorrect parts on the hm done, formalize the answer with full sentence and you will be fine. I did really bad on hm but get over 90 for both of the midterms. I do not know how 350 he teaches but for 300 he is really good. | I absolutely love math. Taking this class is making me hate math. Lectures are pretty terrible, he can't explain concepts well at all. Just gives you some steps to follow, doesn't explain why. Homework is terrible. Absurd amounts of pointless number crunching, puts absolutely no thought into writing his homework assignments Easy A tho... | He's really nice, kind and sweet! I liked his class. Very attractive (; | Great professor, explains everything well and he is really accessible during office hours if you have any questions at all. | This is the worst professor I had in my life. I have no idea whats going in lecture. | he's not really good at making the material understandable, but if you can keep up it is helpful how rigorous he is. also pretty cute imo | He is a really good professor and if you have a question he will explain to you patiently! | Was not a fan, super strict about exams and was not able to explain the abstract concepts well."
"Sengupta, Anirvan",Always available to help.
"Croft, Mark","Professor Croft despite his outdated presentation and website format, has outstanding lectures with interesting experiments. His demonstrations with the spectrometer/glasses, the fire extinguisher, and when he spit out liquid hydrogen into a cloud of smoke were all memorable experiences for me as a student as Rutgers. 100% recommend him for anyone. | I had a great time in Professor Croft's class. He would always do these very fun experiments and it a class I left with a better understanding and respect of the subject, which is very uncommon. | Prof Croft was very sweet and very knowledgeable about his field. But, his class is very lecture heavy and his slides are a bit disorganized. He drops either one or two of the lowest HW grades and curves the midterm and the final. I used the book only to look for answers that I could not find online, but otherwise, the book is not needed. | Prof. Croft is a very sweet person. He is very passionate about astronomy, and cares about imparting knowledge to his students. However, this class is difficult, even if it is intended for non-science majors. His slides are disorganized, and he can be hard to follow. His tests are hard, but he gives a very large curve and is generous with grades. | Prof Croft seems very sweet and is an expert in his field. That being said, as intelligent as he is, he is not a great lecturer. The slides are full of words, but are very unorganized. Everything in this class is simply memorization, and I feel like I'm not retaining any of the material because I am not applying it. | Professor Croft is incredibly sweet and very funny. His class is very lecture heavy, and sometimes hard to follow because he talks a little fast but all of the tests/quizzes are open note and open book. He encourages questions and loves answering them. He cares very much about his students and gives a MASSIVE curve on exams. | Prof. is understand and really wants to help you do your best in class. Lectures arent mandatory but are helpful. Even though his voice is a bit monotone and lectures can be a bit boring the content is interesting. The class is graded on HW, midterm, and a final (exams are pretty clear). He even gives you opportunity for extra credit. Great Prof! | The lectures are useful for quizzes in recitation. The notes are not excessively sloppy, he does sometimes make mistakes but is very willing to correct any. He is not cold like the chemistry department, and will listen to student concerns regarding their performance and take that into account. The exams are very fair if you attend the classes. | Croft was a wonderful professor, smart and cracks a few good jokes throughout lecture. He is transparent about what is on his tests, and arrives one hour early as well as stays an hour after lecture for office hours. He is always happy to help. That said, the lecture notes are messy and the material can be hard. Just study hard and you'll do fine. | Croft is an unbelievably sweet and nice guy who is more than willing to help. However, his lecture notes are a complete mess, and you must go to lecture for clarification. He is not that good at explaining either. The good thing is that he is very straightforward about what he expects for exams, and he curves heavily. | Took him for 203 and 204. He's funny, respects students, does fun experiments, encourages questions, and is experienced (decades of teaching physics). Homework should be done but not part of grade. Recitations have quizzes and exams are challenging (16 multiple choice). He doesn't like to fail students but you need to work hard for a decent grade. | Croft is super funny, and his in-class demonstrations are interesting applications of the material. His lectures are slide-based, and his powerpoints can be really confusing. He gives a formula sheet that contains all you want, and he answers questions really well in person and over email. Just go to lecture. TAs are super helpful too. | Avoid Avoid Avoid. Lecture is power point slides which you have access to anyways because it is online. Worst lecture, worst tests. There are 10 multiple choice answers per question (NO KIDDING!!!). Lecture are so unorganized, you will never going to understand anything in lecture. You have to spend so much time outside of class to understand. | 204 is not difficult at all as long as you generally understand the topics and read through his lectures. His exams are heavily lecture material-based so make sure you actually read through his slides. His notes are confusing so go to lecture for clarification. I went to all the lectures, did all the homework, studied a day before and got an A. | Funny guy but gave complicated lectures. | It is probably the people who do not attend lecture who give him low ratings (75% of students). His exams are VERY easy and are based on examples in his slides and HW problems. Attend lectures for clarifications. HUGE CURVE. He cares and answers any questions we have in office hours. I took him twice for 203 and 204 and would take him again. | My professors who gave me an open ended exam with 50 questions can grade faster than him and this exam was multiple choice | It has been two days since the final. He hasn't released the grades yet. The exam was a scantron. Also, his exams are ridiculous, there are 10 options for a multiple choice question! | His class is a complete mess. His lecture notes are incredibly unclear and he doesn't clarify much in lecture. Sadly, his exams stem from lecture more than the book. The book is very useful for teaching yourself the concepts though. Personally, I went to about 6 lectures total and just read the book heavily. Still got a B+ in the class. big curve! | DO NOT LISTEN TO THE FALL 2015 REVIEWS BELOW. Its one person posting 1 start reviews. Anyway I had Croft for gen phys 1/2 and his class is ok. To do well you need to study on your own because lecture/notes are confusing but he clarifies anything in office hours. Tests are fair, based solely on lectures NOT HW so understand his lectures to get an A | Crofts lectures are painful, but the class is passable if you understand the concepts from Physics 203 and do the homework. I only attended the first lecture, not a single one after that, as all he did was read formulas off of a power point slide. I studied by doing all of the homework problems a week before the exams, and passed with a C. | Never got a low grade in any science class before in life. Well I guess Croft's class is not really a science class. It should be changed to Comedy 101 or Demo 101. If you are a premed, you will regret taking this course since Physics is one of the most important class that med schools look at besides MCAT scores. | Croft is a boring lecturer with a nasty attitude for anybody with a question. His tests are at an extremely high graduate level and does not correlate to his lecture notes or textbook problems. He leaves you unprepared and the only way to pass is through tutoring. | if you attend class , then croft guides you what to study for the exams and you can get a sense of what is important . I personally enjoyed this class and I felt I learned a lot . I noticed a lot of people complained on here , but I also noticed not many people attending lectures . | Listen, everyone here is right. Croft is one of the worst teachers at this school. Having said this, the book is an excellent resource. I never went to class and am still in contention for an A. This class requires a lot of work and a lot of self teaching. Formula sheet is vague. The only plus is the average is put at a B. So its not THAT bad. | Final today which is going to be difficult due to many finals at the same time. Questions require proficiency in abstract Physics like Squarewell Theory and Linear Algebra. Formula sheet is missing many formulas. Textbook and lecture notes do not help that much in studying. | Quiz tomorrow which does not make sense since it is the last day of class. Quizzes are also difficult and do not correlate well with the lectures or the textbook. Puts random questions out of the sky that require an in-depth knowledge of Calculus and Linear Algebra. Does not explain concepts that clearly. | Croft should definitely attend one or some or all of Professor Brahmia's lectures to get a comprehensive idea on how to be a good teacher. Professor Brahmia even has office hours! So if he needs more guidance, he will have it!! | During lecture Croft probably whispers I went to Johns Hopkins. Those students won't go there. This inspires him to create difficult exams and quizzes that are designed to weed out students. Take Physics on-season or in the summer or Honors Physics. | I agree that exams and quizzes are not easy, but difficult. None of the topics on the exams or quizzes are covered in lecture or the textbook. Lecture and textbook problems are easier than the actual exam. Had to use Calculus once to solve a problem. Even Calc 151 and Orgo is easier than this course. I don't care who you are. Just study. | ALL OF THESE PEOPLE GIVING CROFT A 1 ARE LIARS!! don't believe it! Croft is not the best lecture but his exams are very easy and FAIR! All you have to do s do the hw problems and you will be JUST fine. I literally started doing all of hw 4 days prior to the exam and got a B+ which he curved to a high A. Oh yeah he sets the average to a B!. | This class is intense and difficult. Most of the questions on the exams and quizzes are theoretical. Even though there are some computational questions, those questions require an in-depth knowledge of Linear Algebra. Lectures are confusing and not worded that clearly. Textbook is not at the rigor of this course. | Thought that I knew the concepts well for today's quiz, but the quiz was still difficult. All the questions were from the left field. Pretty sure that I did not pass since Croft made sure that the TAs ask questions that covered concepts that students never saw before. | If you want a good GPA, do not take this course. Makes the course more difficult than usual. Questions on the exams are designed for Physics majors. Most of the calculation questions require an extensive knowledge of Calculus 1 and 2 (probably Calculus 3 and Linear Algebra). Half the exam are also theoretical and based on abstract theory. | Exams are difficult for the level of this class. Spent many hours studying for the first exam and knew what I was doing, but somehow failed it since none of the material on the exam was covered in the textbook. Lectures are also pointless since Croft does not explain concepts clearly and none of those concepts are on the exam. | This course is irrelevant and takes away people's interest for applying to med school due to the challenging hourly exams. Exams are harder than Orgo since there is no way to study for it. | This class is terrible and difficult. Exams and quizzes are difficult and intended for graduate students. Even Orgo is easier than this course. | This class is a nightmare. Exams and quizzes are difficult and beyond the scope of the course. Exams and quizzes also do not correlate well with the lecture and the textbook. | This class is tough and requires hours of studying. It's difficult to tell what concepts will be on the exam since there is not enough resources to practice from. The problems in the textbook are basic compared to the questions on his exams. Strongly recommend to take this course in the summer if you will never use Physics again in life. | This man has the ability to generate the hardest questions for a basic Physics exam. Questions do not correlate well with the textbook, lectures, and recitations. Also no practice exams besides the textbook, which does not appear on the exam. Should generate questions similar to the questions in the textbook since there are no other resources. | Exams require abstract thinking rather than computations such as solving for a variable using one or more formula. Lecture notes are not that straight and scattered. Textbook does not help that much when studying since none of the concepts are in the textbook. | Croft needs to reevaluate his teaching methods. Slides are not that organized making the lectures useless and difficult to comprehend. Exams should only have 5 options for each question instead of 10-15 options. Should also release practice exams instead of just textbook problems since they don't correlate to the exam. Also useless in general. | Croft's exams are graduate level and written by a postdoc. Do not be alarmed when you score below a 50. Simply withdraw. I do not understand how the average is in the 60's when most people fail the exams. Probably the people who are only good at Physics score in the 90's and destroy the curve. | Exams are difficult. The formula sheet that he gives you during the exam does not apply to any question. Some of the questions are concepts that was not covered in class and has no definite answer. Spent 20 minutes on one of the questions and got no answer. Probably have to use calculus to solve the problems on the exams. | Exams are difficult and require hours of studying. Even then it is highly unlikely to pass with an A or B since the questions come from the left field. None of the questions are similar to the lecture notes or practice problems for the textbook. Most of the questions are abstract with 10 or more options. Be prepared for a C or below. | This class may not be that difficult at first, but wait until the quizzes and exams. The quizzes and exams do not correlate well with the concepts covered in lecture. Also has difficulty in explaining concepts to students so you have to rely on the book. | His quizzes are too long and hard to even attempt. If you want to save your GPA, I recommend pulling an all-nighter before each quiz. I had other things to do so I failed the first quiz, which was beyond the level of the textbook. Even studying the textbook is not that great since his quizzes are like 300- or 400-level material. | Exams and quizzes require abstract thinking instead of formula manipulation. | This class is terrible. Exams and quizzes are beyond the scope of basic Physics. Formula sheet doesn't apply to the questions on the exams and quizzes. Your whole grade is based off of those quizzes and exams. Believes that this is the only class we are taking. I have other classes to study for. | Steer clear of this course. It is not an easy A or easy to pass. Quizzes contain all abstract questions and TAs are strict in grading those quizzes. Exams are difficult to understand and calculations are based on abstract theory rather than concepts. Greenblatt probably contributed with him before designing the recitation quizzes and exams."
"Baker, Andrew","His lectures were interesting and he seems to be a very easy grader! If you visit him during office hours, he's very understanding and helps the best he can if you have any questions about the material. He definitely enjoys teaching astronomy too, often sharing his experiences in the field. Overall, he just seemed very interested in your education. | Online, had group midterm + final. Great lectures, very interesting if you like the topic, could get tedious+boring tho. Passionate and intelligent. Daily easy zoom quizzes to check for understanding+boost grade. Weekly HW, kinda challenging but encouraged working together. Overall, really loved the guy and his passion for the subject. | HW 2x a week based on lecture ALWAYS posted the day before its due, inconvenient. 1x a Month assigns Essay questions for HW, it is Nov and he hasnt graded any. Midterm and Final are proctored via zoom but deviate greatly from lecture and HW content despite being open note. No late work accepted. Graded Zoom Polls every lecture. | (took him for Interdis seminar, not astro) Horrible teacher for the Inter Dis Seminar. Dude made us write 10 response papers (1 per week), and another 10 page research paper. After all that, he didn't grade any of the papers till the very end. The class does sound cool, but don't take it because the time you put in is not even close to worth it. | 10/10 coolest professor. Only one I've liked so far. Favorite class. | One of the most fun classes I've ever taken! I would take it again in a heartbeat. The lectures are information-heavy - you really do have to pay attention, especially since there's Clicker questions - but it's such fascinating material. There's 10 weekly hw questions, a HUGE curve, and helpful extra credit. I truly enjoyed going to class! | Professor Baker is so knowledgable, kind, helpful, and super organized- favorite professor so far. Lectures are enjoyable and interesting; slides are color-coded and posted. Clicker quizzes every class are fun and give you a chance to talk with others. Only 10 HW questions a week. I truly looked forward to going to class and learned SO SO much. | Professor Baker is hands down the most helpful professor I have ever taken. Responds to emails promptly and courteously, grades very fairly, has a huge curve and cares about his students' knowledge and well-being. As long as you go to class and do the labs, you will be fine. He is open to you asking as many questions as needed, and is just awesome. | Easily one of the best professors at Rutgers. I took him in Fall 2014, and if he ever taught ASTRO109 again, I would recommend to take Baker for anyone interested. His exams are a little difficult, but as long as you take notes, and pay attention in lecture you should be fine. Plus, the curve was so high I believe you only need about an 85 for an A | Prof. Baker makes you work for your grade. That said, his exams come straight from lecture/homework, but they do require application of what you've learned, so you can't just memorize. Clicker questions in every class, so attendance is key. HUGE curve. Go to class, do the weekly homework, understand lectures, and you're golden. | Andrew Baker is the man. By far my favorite professor at the university. If Astronomy interests you, Baker's class is necessary. His class is not easy, however, it comes with a large curve so if you pay attention, and do the homework you should do fine. Lectures can be boring or fun, but are sometimes filled with very interesting demonstrations. | Professor Baker is everything you want in a professor, there is a lot of material that he covers but he is very intelligent and would absolutely take his class again. Still trying to figure out what a Klingon is though... | Always available through Sakai & office hours. Incredibly helpful. Study groups are a must have for grasping the wealth of knowledge and for extra credit. This was a great class and I would take it again in a heartbeat. | Professor Baker was the nicest guy, his jokes were always corny but he knew how to keep his students interested. The demonstrations were so fascinating and he makes an otherwise boring course much more fun. There are a lot of clicker questions in class, a lot of hard homework questions, but an extremely awesome curve. Go to extra credit sessions! | Awesome guy! So chill and really knowledgeable. Highly recommend his Byrne Seminar on Radio Astronomy. | Professor Baker is a really nice guy who will go out of his way to help you understand the material. His tests were kind of hard but he gave the class a ridiculous curve. | He is a very hard working man, if you need help he will go out of his way to help | Kind of hard, gave reading that you have to do. Very helpful but tests are very hard and gives no source of extra credit. Curves well. | REALLY nice guy. Extremely helpful. Actually an interesting course with a lot of cool demonstrations, but it IS very hard, especially if you're not into the topic. Exams are hard but his curves are HUGE. I got a 17/30 on the exam (should have been a 56% F) and it ended up being a B+ | Good guy, helps you out with more than class work. He has in class quizzes during every lecture but if you pay attention they're usually pretty easy | Not a bad lecturer. Explained some interesting things and ended class early. Nice guy."
"Gawiser, Eric","Gawiser is a total rock star in his lectures! They're informative and fun to listen to, his HWs, workshops, projects, and quizzes are easy compared to other lab courses I've had. 11/10 professor!!! | I took Astronomy with him online so it was more manageable for me. You really just have to read through the textbook and pay attention to lectures and you are set. Attendance is mandatory because he does polls based on readings and lectures. He is understanding as long as you respect him. The exams were also open notes and group work. | Grade is based on in class polls, HW, a midterm, and a final. HW and exams are open book. His HW questions are tricky, he really wants you to understand the material so you have to thoroughly read the textbook to get the answers. Exams are in groups which helps unless your group doesnt understand the material. Hes a nice professor overall! | This class is based on weekly quizzes which you won't be able to pass without reading the assigned chapters. The professor is okay, his attitude could use some work but overall it was fine. The midterm and final is in groups which works! | He's an amazing professor! Knows what he's talking about and cares about how you do in the class. Homework is due before class and questions can be worded a bit tricky but easy if you read the textbook. He tries to make the class enjoyable and the midterm is a group effort. Would recommend for a decently easy A | homework due BEFORE he teaches it. lots of trick questions. take another class for the easy a . | Listen he's not a bad guy- but the questions he gives for homework do NOT match up with what is in the textbook. He actively tries to confuse/trick students. Don't take it bc you think it's an easy A- its not. I didn't listen to the one mid review on here and i really should have. | I took this class online in Fall 2020. We met twice a week, and homework was due before meetings. Homework is relatively short and easy if you read the textbook. He does poll quizzes during lecture, so don't miss class. We also had a group midterm, and he gave us an optional final (In light of Covid-19). I highly recommend this professor. | Fall 2020 semester was absolute hell but he made it amazing. He is extremely genuine, caring, a professor who cares about the class. He made the class really easy to keep up with and structured it so that students don't need to over stress. Midterm was a group exam, really easy, and the final was optional for us. Loved him as a person and professor | Took astronomy to fulfill the NS requirement and was kind of surprised by the amount of textbook reading. If you're into astronomy it'll be more enjoyable, especially because Prof Gawiser ties in astronomy news/stargazing to soften the math/science concepts. The lectures can be boring but it's easy to get an A, and he even made the final optional. | while he cares about the material, he assigns way too much work. For an introductory course he assumes we all know/remember math that is not easy. If I knew that this was what the class was going to be like, I would have not signed up. Find another science to fulfill your SAS Core requirement. Not a GPA booster. | The only professor at Rutgers that I enjoyed. Iclicker Qs, history of physics, class discussions, caring, smart, so much more. The rest of the department should emulate his class. | Great professor, one of my favorites from the Physics and Astronomy Department | Cannot recommend enough; definitely one of best professors around. Gawiser cares a lot about his students and has a great sense of humor. Excellent teaching style and grading policy that makes the class both enlightening and easy. Read the notes, go to class, do the homework, get an A. | The absolute, very VERY BEST professor at Rutgers, hands down! Rutgers is one of the luckiest universities in the world to have a professor like him. TAKE HIS CLASS! He's a very knowledgeable professor, and very funny! You will enjoy coming to lecture, and you will leave having learned a lot. He will increase your interest in subject guaranteed. | TAKE GAWISERS CLASS. | Amazing professor. Textbook optional. Homework is worth 50%, it may take a bit of time but at the end of the day, its easier to do well in the class with more weight placed on homeworks than exams. exams are rough, but he grades them very kindly. Answers any and all questions very well with clarity | AstroPhysics 341. Awesome Teacher! Attendance is mandatory and iClicker questions make up 20% of your grade, but they're pretty easy. Definitely take this class with friends since hw is 50% of the grade but he makes it really hard so you'll be obligated to work in groups. Exams are a little tricky but he is a very fair grader. A must take imo. | He is the man! Honestly the best professor in the world, hands down. Words cannot describe how awesome he is. TAKE HIS CLASS!! Need to work to get an A, but it is more than possible. He teaches more than Astrophysics. He teaches HOW to think and learn, and how to properly utilize all the skills you have. | Take this class! Gawiser is the man; he is such a great teacher and really teaches you HOW TO THINK, unlike most professors that just teach you WHAT TO THINK. And if you go, Astrophysics becomes an easy A, or maybe a B. A+ for him though | Great Professor. Makes class interesting, really good at teaching, and is a fair grader. Nice guy one take his class if you can, you'll learn a lot and enjoy it! | This is one of the most in-depth and intellectual profs I've ever had. Easy A. Must take. | Best professor I ever had so far. The class was never boring, always interesting, and you got extra credit for doing fun things like going to the observatory night. Recommend this class to anyone... gonna miss this class | Gawiser is a great teacher teaching a very interesting course. A lot of extra credit is given, and iclicker/attendance is a HUGE part of your grade, so going to class is practically mandatory. Exams aren't too tough and neither are the class quizzes, just read the textbook and you're good! Easy A, if not, an easy B+. | i got a c- on the midterm and still have a high a because of the extra credit and iclicker scores- awesome class, interesting, great professor and pretty much an easy a | One of the best Profs at Rutgers. He knows so much about the subject and describes in depth with awesome demos and powerpoint. Iclicker questions each class worth 1/3 of the grade but thats ok because going to the class was actually worth it. Take this class, he's funny, and practically an easy A | best prof and class ever!!!sooo easy and extremely interesting. demos are amazing and hes super funny. my final grade was a 102 and i barely cracked the book after the first exam. definitely a FUN gpa booster. and hes beyond helpful, giving numerous opportunities for extra credit. a must-take, really. | This guy is the man. Really helpfull, jokes around, cool demos, really helpfull, gives extra credit, the two exams are mad easy. Only downside is that there is a clicker, which counts as an exam, but as long as you read the questions should seem like a joke. Take this class | Awesome teacher. Enthusiastic, and will get you excited too. Able to break down complicated science & math ideas for non science & math students. I thought he was very easy too, but I am a math major with a strong prior interest and knowledge base in astronomy, so i may be biased. | Some of the concepts in astronomy are definitely challenging, but he is able teach the material in a clear manner. Great lecturer and eloquent. Fair grader. | Really nice guy/ great professor. Class is an easy A if you go to class and do the i-clickers. Midterm and Exam are only 25 MP questions. | Really nice guy/ great professor. Class is an easy A if you go to class and do the i-clickers. Midterm and Exam are only 25 MP questions. | The exams may be difficult. You will need to understand the concepts, not just memorize key terms. However, the i-clicker questions and extra credit opportunities really help. | loads of reading, but easy A if you attend all classes and get facts straight. What was annoying, was the fact that he travels alot and there were two substitute which has never happened to me in any other class. But he's a nice guy overall, helps you out. And fun experiments!! | Astronomy. The class seemed to get easier as the semester progressed, which I think was due to the fact that we did a mid-semster survey thing. Go to class for sake of the iClicker and study what he tell you to study for the exams. | Very knowledgeable about astronomy. His exams can be tough, but it helps a lot to read the book and pay attention during lectures. Did a great job at adjusting his teaching style based on mid-course evaluation suggestions, and it really helped. Definitely worth a look for those interested in Astronomy."
"Halkiadakis, Eva","Prof is nice and keeps class interesting with lots of demos but not the greatest teacher. Clicker Q's every class for attendance. Weekly assignments that may be more difficult if you don't pay attention. 5 labs as well that take a little time. The class isn't bad but the teacher isn't amazing either. Manageable nonetheless. | She's so sweet and cares so much about her students. If you study the practice exam and go over practice problems, you will do well in her class. If you forget an equation for the exam/are stuck, she will literally help you through the problem. Amazingly enthusiastic about quantum physics. Very generous with partial credit. | Ok I have mixed feelings about Eva. She is kind and has good intentions but her teaching skills are truly subpar. She kept taking off points for petty things and she is not great at explaining. The work is pretty easy, and exams are multiple choice. If you can understand physics concepts you're good to go. Minimally quantitative. I-clicker daily.. | She is really great at lecturing and has concise powerpoint notes that she also posts on the class website. Try to bring these to class or create a pdf and take notes on them with a stylus. | Made the class a truly enjoyable learning experience, tackled the theoretical part with great ease, and got to know her students on a personal level among other highlights. Thank you for everything, Eva, and I am still dreaming. | Lectures can get difficult to follow, but the exams aren't too difficult. Read the textbook if you don't understand something. | Not good at explaining. She gets very excited about teaching the material but often leaves out key parts and leaves the students lost. Because of the confusing textbook, the concepts are way above the students heads and she only makes it worse. Fortunately, the quizzes, homework, and exams are mostly simple calculations and are much easier."
"Makowski, Patrick","lit professor. lots of swag take class | He's fun, caring, and tries to make physics as easy as possible to understand. homework is fairly light, 10 multiple choice everyweek (unlimited tries), 4 openended questions (graded based on effort) and sometimes study modules (extra multiplechoice). Tests are easy (25 multiple choice questions).he grades on participation and effort, great teacher"
"Brahmia, Abdelbaki","Unless you're premed, do not take 203/204 unless you're prepared to devote a significant portion of your time to the class. Exams are difficult, weekly homework and recitation quizzes, and the formula sheet is subpar. Take 193/194 (or physics at a CC) if you're majoring in CS or a science-adjacent field. Not worth the effort for the average student | Professor Brahmia is a great professor. His in-person lectures are super helpful and he is available for office hours. The quizzes and exams are pretty similar to homework. Overall I would highly recommend his class. | He's very passionate about what he's teaching! Honestly the exams are pretty fair and straightforward as long as you're on top of your work. | Best prof at Rutgers. Provides so many resources and if you can master the homework you will do well on the exams. I would recommend going to in person lectures as well. I cannot say enough good things about him. | Very structured course. Do the homework and make sure you understand it, the problems will be on exams. Same with recitation. Easy to get help in the class since everyone in Rutgers has taken it in some form. | Physics 204 was not difficult, just extremely time-consuming if you want to get an A because you need to have a solid conceptual understanding. Your algebra skills and calculator mechanics need to be ON POINT in order to solve problems quickly and correctly, especially on exams and during recitations. My recitation instructor was also awesome. | While the class is difficult and you will constantly be swamped with work, he provides many resources for you to succeed. Do NOT fall behind or slack off because the lecture videos, HW and recitations all take up so much time. As a senior, I barely had the work ethic to keep up, but if you are motivated, he's a good choice. | very organized with clear and engaging lectures. LOTS of study material and practice questions are provided for every exam, making it easy to study and do well | I HATE THE WAY HE TEACHES. OUTDATED OLD VIDEOS, HARD TO UNDERSTAND. His office hours are the only things that are helpful. | The professor is engaging, but the class demands a lot of work. Completing the homework is crucial for doing well on exams. Unstuck Study AI and practice problems really help with preparation. | Brahmia is everything wrong with college classes His material, in videos, study strats, & course structure (3 big tests) -- are painfully inefficient and outdated Because of his class, plus others at Rutgers, I'd experience PTSD when going to study for over a year, & have experienced multiple nightmares of failing the class months after graduating | Dr. Brahmia is the best. Physics is a hard subject but Brahmia tries really hard to make the class fair. Recitations and homework assignments help to boost your grades. Go to his in person lecture if you can. He emphasizes important questions and concepts in person. He is so passionate that it makes you want to learn physics. | Gen Physics is challenging and requires you to work hard. The online lecture videos are good, but the HW is still the most challenging part of the course. At least my recitation TA was awesome, or else I would have suffered a lot more for no reason. This class is no pushover and requires you to keep up with the pace and put in the work to get an A. | Class content was challenging, but if you put the work in, you will be rewarded. A great engaging professor and a friendly person to talk with. Exams were fair and fairly reflected how much you studied. Enjoyed this experience overall. | My favorite professor at Rutgers, clearly cares a lot about his students. In-person class is much better imo (I watched the vids later). Hw is tedious and can be tricky but solving it helps you grasp the topics. If you struggle with hw go to his zoom office hrs. Always print notes before recitation & try to review so you do well on the quizzes | Very friendly & approachable, clearly loves the subject, & cares a lot about students. Highly recommend going to class bc he explains better in person than in the videos. This isn't an easy course, so stay on top of the topics. Ask him questions after class & watch his zoom office hrs cause he goes over hw. Hw was the worst part of the course imo | When I first took physics in hs I HATED it so much, and was not so excited about it when I had to take it in college. But let me tell you... physics became one of my top favorite classes. Professor Brahmia's lectures were amazing, and the experiments that he demonstrated were interesting and fun. He's very passionate about teaching physics. | Best lecturer I've had at Rutgers. Dr. Brahmia teaches with a lot of passion and energy. Exams are always straightforward, and will never trick you. Extended has a separate built in lab, which I personally thought was much harder than regular lab for gen physics. Overall, stay on top of the topics, do your homework, and it is a very doable course. | Amazing lecturer, make sure to do the homework to succeed in the class as the exams are very similar to the homework problems. The recitations are kinda difficult so make sure to study beforehand. Overall not that hard to get a B/B+ but an A will require a lot more work. | Prob one of the most straightforward classes I've taken. don't need to go to lecture as he posts videos of all the materials, notes, + tons of extra review. just do the work, understand what you're doing, practice, and you'll do well. | Considerable amounts of time expected to be spent on homework, TA does most of the teaching, not the most responsive on emails. Gets his TA's to do most of the heavy lifting. | Amazing physics professor! I did not like physics in high school, but he completely changed my views on physics. His in person lectures are amazing and he emphasizes what you need to know for the exam in the in person lecture. His exams are very fair and the homework and his in person lecture problems are key! | Professor Brahmia is definitely a good physics professor and I would love to have him as the professor for phy204! His lectures are interesting and would help you to solve different problems in an efficient way. He always stays after class to solve any additional questions from us. | He is a tough grader and exams could be difficult, but he is patient. His lectures are inspiring. | Compare to the other physics professors, he is probably the best. He gives 12 problems and you have one week to finish them. He also does practice problems during class which is really helpful. The work he gives is similar to exam questions. The course is still difficult, so make sure to watch the videos before class to be prepared. | His lectures are amazing, always go in person! Take the HW seriously, and watch his recorded zoom reviews if you get stuck on a problem. | If you have time to go to his in-person lectures please go!! He is so much more engaging and does a lot of demos and questions to help you understand. They are early in the morning but it'll reflect on your exams (in a good way!) | I took 203 and 204 asynchronously but his lecture videos were still good to learn off of. Exams typically felt fair, though some final exam questions were unusual this semester for 204. Weekly homework and quizzes are assigned, and they can be somewhat difficult or tedious, but they are much harder than any exam material, so it's good practice. | Very good teacher, the best I had during my undergraduate time at the university. Attending the lectures and online reviews help a lot for the homework and exams. More easily accessible after the lectures and during the review sessions than through emails. Answers to and helps effectively with concerns regarding the homework and previous exams. | worst professor at rutgers. horrible. horriblle. | Brahmia was almost the reason I wanted to double major in CS and Physics. He's an amazing lecturer and willing to help you out if you ask and show the same respect you demand. There's a lot of homework and the homework sometimes is trickier than the lectures, but they train you to tackle the exams easier. 10/10 prof | His lecture/recitation videos are usually very thorough and well explained. Responds to emails very quickly, though can be a bit unhelpful in them. 1 homework and 1 quiz a week -- they can be kinda tricky but again, his vids help. Exams are much easier than an average homework problem, and can be taken online (though only with lockdown browser) | He posts weekly lecture videos. They cover most of the basics but for HW the questions are much harder and require a little self learning to do. Tests are weighted heavily but doing the hw and his practice problems are perfect preparation. There is A LOT of content though so stay on top of the work or you will regret it. | He's a nice guy, but the material is generally way too hard. Almost every problem is some algebra puzzle, and nothing is really just plug and chug; every problem is completely different from the other, especially regarding lecture problems vs quiz/hw/exam problems. Additionally, his grading can be really harsh. | worst professor. do not take if possible. i understand physics 1 is hard but the physics department at rutgers is complete garbage | Would not recommend. Recitation is a series of timed quizzes 3 grouped and 1 individual quiz. Lecture is short snippets as he would describe it teaching the general information on weekly topics. followed by lecture problem he performs. Practice exams are far from the reality of the exams and no time to ever talk or learn one to one or in face | The worst professor I ever had at Rutgers, he could be the only bad professor I ever had. Taking this course with him is like self-taught with a bunch of prerecorded youtube videos. Recitation is awful, too. TA doesn't even care how well you have learned the material, and they will have must complete handouts count toward grades. | Professor Brahmia was probably the most straightforward professor I've ever had, and he presented the course material in a concise and digestible manner. His lectures took no more than 1-2 hours per week to watch and homework was very helpful for exams. I took 203 during the spring and 204 over the summer and had a great experience both times! | I love Professor Brahmia! He is a literal angel and the best teacher I have ever had! I was completely lost at one point and he took the time outside of class to explain everything to me clearly and make sure I understood. His class is very manageable as long as you put in the necessary work outside of class. | Decent overall. 204 was a lot more difficult than 203. That being said, exams were more difficult as there were more unusual problems on exams. They were not just from the homework or lecture problems like before in 203. Pay much more attention in class as a lot of the ideas discussed are taught in actual lecture and not the lecture videos. | Great professor overall. Concepts were taught in great detail. Exams were very fair as they were based mostly on lecture problems and homework problems. Overall a great learning experience. | Pretty smooth and easy class if you understand physics itself. If not, I suggest putting extra attention into ""seeing"" it. By mandatory I meant recitations. They are pretty easy to do and with the right group, you can leave early if you're that fast. LAs are very friendly and give possible approaches to a problem if a group is stuck. | He is the michael jordan of physics professors. | I took 203 and 204 and ended with an A and a B+ respectively. He is a solid lecturer and he clearly knows his stuff, but the class is general should definitely be 4 credits, not 3. He expects us to watch his asynchronous lectures, attend his live lectures, and attend recitations. The homework's are manageable as long as you work on it with others. | Listen, at the end of the day you are teaching yourself Phys 1 as if you decided one day to do so with Utube videos. All you have are a set of videos per topic from him and they cover basic ideas. Then online HW becomes 10x more complicated. Exams are difficult, recitation is not helpful, and will ONLY hurt you if ill-prepared. Overall be careful. | This class isn't as difficult as people make it seem, but you do have to put in a lot of work to get a good grade. His asynchronous videos are pretty terrible but his in person lectures are a lot better and help you actually understand concepts instead of just how to do problems. Brahmia can be condescending at times but he's a decent teacher. | No matter how much I tried in this class, my exam grades still ended up being bad. Super hard to keep up as the work given is super difficult, homeworks are so hard that even after 4 attempts all questions are never fully correct. You have to dedicate a LOT of your time just for this one class in order to do well. | Gives you a few short videos to go over a weeks worth of topics. Does not respond to emails. Makes you buy access to his own website. Over complicates things. Ironically he is the only option Rutgers gives you for physics 203. Thanks Rutgers! | Frankly the hardest class I have ever come across in my life (so far as a freshman). While he does try, he doesn't go through all the types of questions we could encounter on quizzes and exams or he takes easier questions and alters them to where you have to think outside the box like crazy. His grading system is horrible; exams ARE your grade. | This guy makes literally no sense. The entire department at Rutgers is beyond bad. Extremely hard class with no instruction."
"Khan, Hamza","Great teacher, explains concepts very well - It was fun to go to his class 3 | Physics Lab with Faraz is a breeze. He is pretty informal which is great. If you ask for help, he will be more than welcome to assist you and even do some of the lab to help. Answers questions well and easy grader. A+"
"Bunkowski, Klaudia","She was such a cool lady and was very interactive with students. | I really enjoyed the class and was actually excited to come to class every weekend. I thank klaudia for a wonderful semester. I appreciated her caring disposition and teaching style. | Klaudia is an excellent instructor! She is very supportive and present, and it was very evident that she wanted us all to succeed and connect to the course content in a meaningful way. The class discussions that she led were interesting and relevant, and I found myself even more excited about the topic as a direct result of her thoughtful care. | Klaudia's lessons are very well planned with lots of interesting, real life examples and discussion points. She explains difficult topics well and creates a safe environment for everyone to participate. She provides very clear expectations for assignments and exams. She takes time to check in with each group and answers emails in a timely manner. | Klaudia delivers lessons with clarity, she uses examples from real life situations and makes her classes interactive by starting them with group discussions and activities. She is always available for assistance with lessons and homeworks. She is kind to her students and everyone feels importand and respected in her classes."
"Mainiero, Thomas","He is not the worst professor but his lecture was boring ,his handwriting is too small, and he speaks softly and quietly. Yet the best of him is his exams. They helped me prepared for final exam which was amazingly easy if you compared it to his. I would encourage you to study from homeworks and Youtube (i.e. PatrickJMT) I hope this helps! | first test:easy A. next two: super hard his lectures are extremely boring and are somewhat important if you are not good at teaching yourself material. if you are, only go to a few and then just study really hard for the exams. I got a B+ not he first exam, D on the second, B on the final and ended up with a C+.wish i had studied for second | Robinson is a nice guy and tries to help you out. His midterms were really hard but I still got B's with the curve. He prepares you well for the departmental final which felt so easy after his tough exams. Just stay on top of the work and do the usual studying. | Professor Robinson's exams were very difficult but he gave a really generous curve that made up for it. Also, unlike professors who gave easier exams, his exams really helped prepare for the final, which is made by the department. He even has extra office hours the night before each exam in case you still don't understand something or need help. | Robinson is really nice, but he can be confusing with his lectures since he speaks softly and writes illegibly. Overall, the midterms are pretty hard, but the curves are very generous and he gives easy extra credit. If you have him, the final will be fairly easy, and you may finish the course work early. He offers help if but only of you ask. | Prof. Robinson is nice and helpful. His exams are actually kind of fun. | Robinson, although very intelligent, is not the greatest teacher. He is unclear in lectures and spends far too much time on unnecessary derivations and not enough time on more important applications. | Robinson is an interesting one. He is remarkably smart, and has a lot of confidence in his students. This doesn't work too well for teaching though, since it seems like he expects his students to make the same logical leaps he does in class. In a general sense, he is a great professor if you make it clear what you don't understand. | He expects the students to understand everything he says at the pace that he says it. He talks quietly and talks to the board. Sit in the front. Your textbook and Khan Academy will be your best friends during this course. Texts are extremely hard but the curves are insane since everyone messes up. I would have chosen another teacher if i could. | Horrible Professor could not learn anything in class. Feels pointless going to class. Extremely difficult exams, even the TA's think they are hard. Very quiet and hard to hear, but feel bad for the guy and can't hate him. | He speaks so quiet that you can't understand what he is saying even when you're sitting towards the front. It's no use asking questions either. You're better off learning the material on your own and with your teaching assistant to pass. I honestly don't know why the university is paying him to whisper to the chalkboard twice a week. | Talks to the board and gets mad if you ask him questions that he thinks are ""dumb."" His exams are way too hard for a calc 1 college class. | Robinson made this class a breeze. He gives you hints during workshops, hw does not have a set due date, and gives fair reviews for exams. The exams, however, are very tough. As long as you do your work, participate in workshops, and attend lecture, you can ride the curve to passing grade. Also worth noting that he zooms right through the book. | Worst teacher i've had in my first semester at rutgers. He speaks to the board, cannot 'read' the students (as in he says all the time ""i cannot tell what you guys are feeling right now...okay lets move on"") he comes to class late on a bike. He finished thematerial 3 weeks early, and instead of reviewing or slowing down, he starts calc152. | Literally the WORST professor I ever had. No sympathy. Cannot understand him during lectures or read his handwriting. Exams are impossible compared to the hw and workshops and the final is ridiculous. Hands down worst professor I've ever even heard about. | A truly excellent professor. He does speak softly and has poor handwriting, but if you sit near the front and you'll be fine. Explains concepts in layman's terms to make differential equations a breeze to comprehend. His class is well constructed and exams are fair. Highly recommend. | So, Robinson is a sort of special teacher, even though he does have a Math Degree and clearly knows stuff, however there are issues, such as clarity, He makes very intuitive leaps, and questions to clarify them can often result in confusion. Speaks quietly and has messy handwriting, so sit up front. Nice guy, rather bad teacher. | Horrible teacher, does not speak to the class, but rather to the board. his handwriting is illegible, his exams and homework questions do not correlate and he always starts class late. DO NOT take him. | Sit in the front if you wanna learn stuff because he's quiet. Otherwise, great teacher. | Test is IMPOSSIBLE!! So tough compared with other teachers. The average score is 35.... His speaking is also unclear. Better not take his calculus course, or you will lose confidence. | Terrible teacher. Does not interact with students at all. Tests are NOTHING like lecture or textbook problems. Practice tests are way easier than the exam. Does not matter how good at calculus you are, he does a lot of unnecessary proofs that will confuse you. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. | i love him! | DONT TAKE CALC WITH HIM. you can find an easier professor in the summer i promise. just not him. tests are IMPOSSIBLE compared to other teachers. he is really smart but too difficult | Seems a little bit insane. It's okay, he is going for a Ph.D in Math - that explains the disheveled appearance of this man. Otherwise, a pretty good teacher. | Feels like he's just talking to the board | terrible, always just stares at the class in silence, takes points off for his own unjustified reasons. | I love Tom so much. He's nice, hot and good teacher. | he is the man, but do NOT disrespect him or he will bring the wrath"
"Chakhalian, Jak","Really knowledgeable and easy going | Love this guy! | OK I was wrong before. It turns out that if the current isn't passing by a junction it always remains constant through any edge even if you change the cross sectional area of the resistor. He didn't explain this very well but at least he didn't give wrong information. 5 stars to offset my last rating. Dont know how to delete ratings. | Gave us the wrong information in lecture. He said that if you change the cross sectional area of the wire, then the current stays the same. No it doesn't, Jak, it changes."
"Neuberger, Herbert","Prof cares about students + wants them to succeed. Offers EC opportunities, so DEFINITELY take advantage of those-marketing research studies! Assignments are leniently graded by TA. Announces pop quizzes, which are really simple (10 T/F) but make sure you study for them. Exams have confusing questions, but make sure to ask TA/prof for clarification | Miller receives hate for being ""obsessed with AI"" but genuinely wants to highlight importance of using AI. His exams aren't hard, did minimal studying and passed all the exams. Attendance is only mandatory and taken the day of exams and speakers, but attending class makes reading manageable as class goes hand in hand with textbook | Is obsessed with AI for some reason. He doesn't engage with the class at all, & his slides are from McGraw Hill. I feel like the class was much harder than it needed to be. The two key things you learn In this class is ""Companies value AI"" & ""Connections/networking matters"" I couldn't tell you anything about marketing after taking this class. | Attendance is mandatory and his lectures can be boring. His tests are pretty hard because they can be over anything he talks about and he doesn't provide his lectures on Canvas. However, he is really sweet and a good person. He also curves grades at the end. He will also write letters of recommendation and try to help anyone out. | This class should NOT be as difficult as he makes it out to be. Tell me why most of his lectures are him rambling about football, his time at IBM, how many CEOs he knows, and his previous students who are supposedly now CEOs. And NONE of this will be on the 3 difficult exams throughout the semester. Such an inefficient professor. Do NOT take him. | Do not take this professor - im taking Millers MKT 337, Fin 367 and Acc 326 all at the same time and mkt 337 is the hardest. Tests are majority of your grade and purely textbook- what he lectures on is vaguly related to the textbook, but its basically useless. Bro litterly just jabbers for and hour about how he has rich friends and likes ice hockey | This guy is the prime example of why tenure is failing the higher education system. Lectures are just rambles; his slides tie to the textbook, but nothing he says will. The tests, which are a significant chunk of your overall grade, have no basis reality, lectures, or the book. If you have this prof, drop him. Good luck. | Do not take this class. It is a disservice to pay thousands for a class and receive this poorly of an education. Canvas, tests, projects, and grading run entirely by the TA. Tests are random vocabulary words you have no business memorizing. Lectures are hard to follow and hardly related to anything on exams or projects. | Professor Miller is the most egotistical person I have ever encountered. Most of his lectures are spent boasting about his various accomplishments and connections. As far as the class itself, the material is easy to grasp and exam questions are directly correlated to the textbook. He could be tolerable if he humbled himself. | Whatever reason you have for taking Miller, it's not worth it. Though he cares about his students, his lectures are completely useless as he spends 50% of them discussing irrelevant topics. Tests are based on textbooks and random facts said during lectures and guest speaker sessions. Tests ask unfair questions that you have no business memorizing. | The class content-wise wasn't horrible, but he is an interesting character, to say the least. Every class all he does is brag about his rich friends and yells unnecessarily to stress his points. He also talks a lot about AI and uses words I don't even think he knows what they mean. Class is not hard, but the group project can be very annoying. | Professor Miller brags about his life the entire class and basically claims that you're going to be unsuccessful if you don't do marketing. He thinks women are only fit for marketing and favors the men in his class. He is obnoxious and makes it hard to go to class.The class is easy though if you utilize Quizlet as every exam is straight from there. | Doesn't teach just rants about bitcoin, tesla, & AI and how women should do MKT & leave finance for the boys. Brags about athletes in the class and is singles out ""frat"" guys in the class and becomes their friends. literally worst part of my year & his TAs run the whole class & still are very late to post info about assignments. Tests are random | This professor wastes your time. He spends the whole class lecturing about his famous rich friends and how important building relationships are in business. This is useless considering it's repetitive and not relevant to the exams. You will have three tests that are straight from the textbook and quizlet. | Prof Miller was ok. His lectures were boring and unnecessary for success on the exams. The speakers he brought in were boring but necessary for the exams. Reading the textbook and doing well on the project are the only important parts of the class. | I don't think I learned anything in the class. Professor was loud and would go on random rants about his alleged famous friends. The class was not too difficult if you read the textbooks. | I don't understand the negative reviews. Professor Miller is amazing - he shares inspirational career and (funny) life advice stories throughout the lectures, he's chill, and genuinely cares for his students. He's very accessible outside class and is always down to help with your career endeavours and give advice if needed. | Never had a professor or really anybody who brags about their life as much as him. He comes across as trying to show off when given any opportunity to, and he doesn't even realize it.Every example is catered around student athletes in the class and he only talks to them. Overall really just an awful class, take any other professor if possible. | This is probably the worst class I have ever taken. His lectures are very useless and all he does is rant and brag about himself and what he does/buy. It is so hard to listen in class because they're very nonengaging. This class is difficult for no reason because the tests are so textbook heavy. | I adore this man. Lectures are dry, but tests are honestly manageable with mainly quizlet for vocab. Absolutely do the extra credit and try and work ahead on the group project. Even if he might not be the most exciting lecturer, he really really loves his students, and his excitement to teach and connect with people makes it worthwhile! | The class itself isn't too difficult, three tests which are all reasonable if you read the textbook (read the textbook if you want a good grade) and a group project which is graded fairly easy. The downside of this class is having to sit through his lectures which are useless (never on test) and are always rants. | The class was a joke. Lectures were useless, & it was mostly reading from the textbook that taught you anything, & even then, the textbook had a whole lot of useless information as well. The professor and TA were talking from the beginning of the semester about a curve, they kept hyping it up and they just ended up giving everyone a 1 point curve. | He spent half of the class trying to convince us that he has great connections and that we need to be marketing majors. It felt like a sales pitch at times. Like everyone says, textbook is all you need. The lectures felt like a waste of time for me. | The class is challenging in that most of what you hear in class isn't on the test. Focus on memorizing the vocab words in the textbook. Also, the textbook can easily be found online for free. | Miller really didn't do much in our class except read the lecture slides - his TAs made the exams, graded assignments, and did pretty much everything else. Miller always references Peloton and constantly brings up his glory days in a frat in college. The textbook is what you need for the exams - not the lecture slides. Would not recommend him. | Seems like a nice guy. Solid lecturer. Only complaint is he uses peloton for all of his examples. If you have seen their stock recently then you can see the issue. | Prof. Miller is not bad. Easy assignments, 4 exams, pop quizzes(freebies) make sure to watch lectures and you should be fine. He is very boring but cares about students, but he is an a**h1le and loves to flex about his rich friends which seems to be the highlight of his life. The TA's do all the work they are the best, he can be useless at times. | Prof. Miller is seriously the best! Easy assignments as long as you follow directions. 3-4 exams throughout the semester and a couple pop quizzes, all are easy if you read textbook and keep up with lectures. It is evident he loves what he does when he teaches and he cares about his students. Get to know him! He also has many connections. | Professor Miller is a solid choice for this class. I really dont get the bad reviews, he talks alot but its entertaining and not hard to follow. Alot of the test material comes straight from the lectures and textbook. Just make sure to learn definitions and read the slides for class. Super easy if you just be proactive about studying. | Professor Miller is very kind and is passionate about what he teaches. However, the exams can be tricky unless you memorize every single thing on the powerpoints and in the textbook. | He talks too much for you to be bored! Gives a lot of examples though. Two chapters per week and the powerpoints are updated to match the textbook. EASY IF YOU READ! | Ignore bad reviews! Solid choice. cares about his work and his students. Boring? Yes, but the class is easy if you READ. Very simple set up for assignments, weekly quizzes are freebies,. exams can be tricky. Focus on definitions at the end of chapters imo. End project is easy A too - do brochure and linked-in acct. Article papers are simple! | Easy A for me, but that was because I was willing to READ THE TXTBK every week & make QUIZLETS. Lecture mandatory: tells rich ppl stories to tie into reading (quite boring). 1 chapter of reading per class. 5 quizzes: keep 4. 5 article summaries: grade boosters. 4 exams: HEAVILY TXTBK VOCAB BASED. Guest speakers in lecture. Project @end was EASY! | I took Herb's class in Fall 2020. I only attended the very first lecture. The whole semester I only used the online textbook and questions and I finished with an A-. There are 4 multiple-choice exams, 5 true/false quizzes (he drops the lowest one), 5 article summaries (about a short article), and one project. I recommend taking this course. | he was a really good professor. he was funny and gave a lot of good advice! The lectures were posted online, the assignments were easy, and so was the final project. Just make sure to use the study tools in the textbook and study definitions mostly. | He's a nice guy and always has tons of stories and real-world examples that relate to the content. The readings are REALLY easy and light. The online textbook highlights important information and gives questions that are great practice for the exams. Exams should be easy as long as you pay attention in class and do the reading. | his lectures will put you to sleep and he only talks about 4 things: his millionare friends, his time at IBM, his wife's Mercedes, or his brochure resume. Nice guy but lectures are just unbearable. Tests aren't bad and the quizzes he gives out are super easy and meant to boost your grade. | He is an awesome professor and really cares about you. He even helped me with my consulting recruiting when I had questions on how to handle multiple offers. The exams are textbook and guest lecturer based and there's a project that is pretty easy. Pop quizzes are lecture and textbook-based mainly. | Don't really need to pay attention in class because his lectures are based on powerpoint that mean nothing/aren't on the test. Though, there are pop quizzes, so you should actually go. Study vocabulary, that's all this class really is. You don't need the book, you can learn everything you'll need to learn by searching the class on Quizlet. | I truly believe that this professor is passionate about marketing. Can't say the same for his lecture. None of the class slides will be on the exam. Focus on reading the textbook; It's actually interesting. Non-cumulative MC exams. A lot of concepts/terms to memorize (same for other professors) | This man spent about 20% of the time teaching us and the other 80% of the time telling us how great our lives would be if we made some little brochure. I stopped showing up about 2 weeks into the semester and still got a B. | Underrated professor. Miller does things his own way, as he's been teaching here for 30 years. He keeps things very interesting, and the class is straightforward. Skim the textbook to do well on the exams, and you can honestly learn a lot from this guy. He is very well connected and wants his students to succeed in life, not just school. | One thing about professor Miller is that he goes out of his way to give you resources to help you succeed after graduation. Lots of guest speakers that are interested in actually recruiting you. He really does have your best interest. Even with tests, he's reasonable. | Professor Miller is one of the worst professors that I've had at UT. From the outdated powerpoints that he reads off of in class to his constant yelling over absolutely irrelevant things, I ended up learning more about Herb Miller's times at IBM and success of previous students rather than about Marketing. | Forget whatever anyone is saying about this class. This guy is a gem. This class with Miller isn't an easy A but it very possible. Miller's exams are mostly based off the textbook. Spend a couple of days reading the textbooks well (i.e take notes of major points) and you will do well-above the average in the exam. He also gave a lot of extra credit | Nice guy, but lectures weren't helpful. I like the powerpoint fill in notes (because it's easy to fill in the blank) but never engaged in class. Never knew what to study, so I would recommend reading through the chapters and looking over the powerpoints. The 5 total quizzes are really easy, extra credit offered, tests aren't bad (but do study). | He's a very sweet person, but I wouldn't recommend taking his course if you want to actually learn something. He constantly goes off tangents in lecture, so I eventually stopped listening, However, he does offer extra credit and his exams are *reasonably* easy to pass if you reread the lecture slides. Didn't buy the the textbook. Easy A if you try | Miller is a stand-up guy, but take it online. TAs write exams w/questions that contradict lecture and textbook material, making getting an A hard. Tests based on textbook and videos/stories he tells from class. Many confuse his story references for arrogance, but he's very caring & just wants to show how he's helped ppl be successful in the past. | Everything revolves around this guy. He focuses more on name-calling and talking about himself than on covering necessary material. I am a marketing major and Professor Miller makes me question my decision to pursue a marketing major. | I have never met someone with such a big ego. Lectures are actually unbearable. ALL he talks about is how great he is and how he is the perfect example of success. You will not learn a thing. It actually angers me to listen to him speak. He has the BEST connections and knows ALL the right people. Don't waste your time."
"Chou, John Paul","He did not know how to teach an intro physics course properly. He said homework should approx. take 8-10 hours per week. Exams were very challenging requiring excessive preparation in order to get at or above the 40% average. Took AP physics and still found it very challenging. Would not recommend for new students! Coming from a student w/ A avg. | If you're not very strong in physics, take 123 or 123H instead. 271-273 averages are low because too many are pushed into this fast-paced honors sequence. JPC is great and teaches well, but the broad, tough coursework causes struggles. There's a generous curve, though. If you're gifted and love physics, go for it. If not, avoid it. | (Honors Physics I) Horrible Professor, lectures were useless, the exams were nothing like the Homeworks like he says, and does no practice Problems at all. The exams are extremely hard, and even with prior physics knowledge, the exam questions are still difficult. The exam averages were like 40%,and lectures are extremely useless. | For Honors Physics 1, Prof. Chou is knowledgeable and helpful. However, the lectures are highly theoretical and we rarely went through practice problems, making the homework and exams very difficult. There is a curve at the end and I got mid to high 40's on the exams and ended with a B. Try to review calculus and physics before taking this class. | (Physics I Honors) Mr. Chou uses no notes for his lectures and explains things in a way that only Einstein would understand. The majority of the class leaves more confused than when they walked in. The average on the final exam was a 40%, if that says enough. Showing up to lectures is a waste of time. Accept your fate if you get him. | His class was amazing, but difficult. I had previous experience in physics during high school, which made his lectures very intuitive and the problems easier, but if you have not had that experience brush up. His lectures are top tier, and his knowledge is deep. He is always open to explaining concepts, and has humour in lectures. Amazing. | He is terrible | got an A and aced one of the exams, and i still cant follow his lectures. he moves very quickly at a high level w/o regard to what students do/don't understand. read the textbook and try to understand it deeply (if ur falling behind, preread sections before lecture to prime ur brain). then cram problems madly leading up to the exam, and pray to God | honors sec for 227 was hard, but chou made it doable. he speaks very theoretically and was kinda all over the place, but he makes the content seem cool. he's a very fair grader and reasonable person- he curved our class really heavy bc we all did bad on the exams and the final. it was his first time teaching E&M so he was just figuring it out too | Professor Chou is a terrible professor. Even if you read the textbook, attend lecture and recitation, do all the homework AND understand it, you still will do terribly on his arbitrarily difficult and misguided exams. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS | Not super easy or anything but he was so helpful and nice that I would give him a 5 even if I failed. Once we went online everybody got the iClicker points for free and exams were fair if you watched his amazing lectures. Man is a legend and his house tour after one of the lectures was the highlight of the semester. | Really good professor, tries to connect with students and illustrates difficult concepts very well. Really good guy all around and extremely knowledgeable. | Nothing similar between his lecture, homework, and exams. Nothing in homework covered in his lecture notes. Basically study by yourself. | One of the smartest professors I have ever had. He is funny and energetic and SO passionate. I took him for honors physics III and really enjoyed it. He is so good at explaining the difficult concepts and answers any questions you have. Even though the exams were hard because he is so intelligent, I learned a lot and am happy I took the course | Ask questions in lecture if you dont understand something. He once answered the same question three times within a few minutes. Workshop attendance is mandatory. Exam and quiz questions are taken from the homework, iclickers, and past exams. | Lecture is a great way to get extra credit. If you understand the book, you don't really need to pay attention. Exams were really easy (except the second midterm) and the recitations are decent. Overall, easy A. | Chou has by far one of the best voices for a physics lecture. So soothing and he's so easy to follow. Great lecturer and makes physics 124 a joke. Well physics is always a joke at this school, easy A bruhh | Good lecturers are hard to find but Prof Chou is def one of the best lecturers in the uni. Lectures arent even boring in his class. I learned a great deal and started to enjoy the subject more. He also has nice sense of style. | I actually really looked forward to lecture-- he goes through the material clearly and will explain if people have trouble. Also, the demonstrations were always awesome. I highly recommend taking him if you can. | His lectures are great. He goes over the important concepts that will show up on the exams. His i-clickers count as extra credit towards your final grade. Got a low grade on final exam, but still passed with a B | J.P. Chou is a good lecturer. You can tell he's super intelligent but tries his best to dumb things down to teach. I learned a lot in this lecture, and obviously you've gotta love the phys lecture demos. | The previous comments are accurate, but the rating on helpfulness needs to be higher. | He's a nice guy, but he assumes you know way too much. The final was impossible, if you want to do well you need to study everything every week. Other than having to put in a lot of time, not that bad."
"Haule, Kristjan","Professor Hannesson was the best! His classroom was an extremely safe place where any perspective was welcome. Hannesson is absolutely hilarious and grades quite easy. I did not hear of anyone getting less than a 100 on any assignment if they turned it in according to the rubrics. This is exactly what Gen Ed courses should be like. TAKE HIS CLASS! | Professor Hannesson has been great this semester. I loved his class, and he was always so understanding and nice to students. I definitely recommend! | I loved this class so much and it never caused me stress. We had very doable readings every week and just one quick discussion/reflection due at the end of the week where you can write about anything. He also gave us two extra credit opportunities and was so sweet and cared about the material. I would take another class of his again if I could. | Professor Hanneson was one of the best professors I have had at Carolina. He made me love English, and the class material. He chooses unique readings and makes every student feel valued. Definitely a must have professor. | If you're looking for an easy A, take this class. As long as you do the readings and understand what is going on in the books, you'll be fine. One in-class quiz, midterm, and the final were all based on the readings. Prof. Hannesson's lectures can be a bit long and boring, but he is extremely intelligent and funny- I really enjoyed having him. | There's one short answer assignment a week and about 100 pages of reading a week so it isn't horrible. The midterm, quiz, and final are all pretty easy as long as you actually do the readings. He lectures about confusing themes but they aren't reflected in the tests so you don't have to retain the lectures. | Professor Hannesson is a sweet man but his lectures are boring and kind of hard to follow. He is so intelligent that he sometimes will go off on tangents. There is a LOT of reading in this course but the quiz, midterm, and final are not difficult. READ THE BOOKS. You will not pass with spark notes or online summaries, you read, you pass. | Hannesson makes this class super easy. He tends to go off on tangents but its not a really a big deal. He's a pretty funny and interesting guy. Literally all you have to do is show up to class and turn in your assignments and you'll be good to go. He's a pretty easy grader. Literally turned in every assignment late and still got 100s on everything. | Kristjan was super kind and funny during class and very easily approachable for help. This was my first college language class and he made it very engaging and fun the whole time. | Kristjan and this class are the absolute best. Hands down easiest class I've ever taken - weekly hw was just reading & submitting a 75 word response graded for completion. He is the sweetest person and really cares about students and the material. Class is just him talking about the books we read and you can miss 3 with no penalty. 10/10 recommend"
"Kabir, Adeeb","Adeeb is obviously very knowledgeable about the Ottoman Empire and Central Asia. His lectures are long and it's hard to get a sense if he likes how you answer a question. However, you will learn a lot in his classes. The reading materials are usually engaging as well. Con: if he disagrees with your essay thesis, your grade will take a hit. | Adeeb is a good professor. His style is very lecture heavy though, which is not my preference. I did learn a lot in his class though and the material was very interesting. | Very biased, has favorite students, and extremely lecture heavy classes | Adeeb is an incredible prof with a TON of knowledge on Central Asia, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East. If you're interested in any of those historical fields, you MUST take a class with him before you graduate from Carleton. As a 300-level, this course was really difficult, but incredibly informative and taught a lot about revolution. | Great lectures, interesting subject matter, and thoughtful discussions. Pretty challenging but doable. In papers, you may have to tailor what you talk about to what he specifically discusses in class, but it's not as if he forces you to agree with him to get a good grade either. | The number I put is incorrect, I took HIST265, Central Asia in the Modern Age, with him. My biggest complaint was that the class was almost 100% lecture. I didn't get much out of this class because that is not an effective way of learning for me. I think I needed a little something more to spark my interest in the subject, which didn't happen. | Adeeb does a really great job of teaching and is incredibly talented in his field. He is a very insightful lecturer and poses great questions for the class. Definitely recommend taking HIST241 with him, as it gives a really good overview into the early years of the USSR and the Russian Revolution/end of the Empire. | Not super tech savvy, but a fantastic prof. He's very clear about what he expects, so it shouldn't be too hard to infer anything aside from that. | I cannot recommend Adeeb enough! The class was very discussion-heavy, but his lectures were always the highlight. The workload was definitely manageable, and it is very helpful to do all the readings. | Adeeb is a great lecturer and professor. I really like how he shuts down the students who use big words without actually saying anything with substance. Do the readings- he spends a lot of class time on them. Really liked the class in general | Funny guy | Adeeb is hilarious, really interesting lectures and it is obvious that he is a real genius. Only problem is he will assign about 150-200 pages of reading a night, thus it was pretty obvious that most people didn't do them. So the class is mostly him speaking for 2 hrs which can be pretty grueling. I'd still highly recommend taking a class with him. | He is a really fantastic guy and a wonderful professor. He is really excited about what he teaches, and wants everyone to be excited too. He does assign hefty readings, but it's worth it because he's such a great lecturer. Not too tough a grader either! Definitely try a class with him!! | No Comments"
"Pixley, Jedediah","(TOOK THIS DURING COVID) really interesting topic and would suggest! This prof taught with another and was great. Knowledgeable, excited, fun, chill. No textbook, quizzes or test. Weekly readings and reflections, individual and then group research projects and presentations. Only con was camera had to be on/mandatory attendance and we couldn't eat"
"Andrei, Eva","She wasn't very good at lecturing and often went too fast, especially near the end. The slides were riddled with errors, but she was willing to fix her mistakes. My average for the iClicker was bad, but getting a 110 on the homework and doing well on the exams was easy. The exams are straightforward, with all problems coming from given problems. | Save yourself from taking this course with her. The course content is very interesting but you wont learn that from her. You'll be taught by the textbook in this class since the lectures are riddled with errors, at least sometimes they get corrected. But on the other hand the errors in the midterm review and final review solutions never got fixed:( | Genuinely do not take Eva Andrei if you don't have to. She makes consistent mistakes not only in the lecture material, but our quizzes and even MIDTERM REVIEW materials. No respect for students circumstances, she made me take an exam with COVID. It's clear she's just here for research. | completely disrespectful to me personally, and sets high expectations with lecture iclickers on the material we just learnt. | Incredibly hard!!!!!!!!!!! I had my intro to solid state class with her in my last semester of undergraduate and this was the most difficult class ever in my entire life! This class was not for average people. It 's for genius | The equipment was outdated and what was really wanted from the lab reports was made clear after they had already been graded. | Best class in all of Rutgers. Pretty hard tho. | I personally liked her. She may appear to be harsh but she in fact is a nice woman with kind heart. She made me learn so many things that are useful to my future. | gr8!"
"Mcquinn, Kristen","Very fun class, midterm and final was MCQ. Grade is mostly based on weekly HWs. | Amazing professor- clear lectures and does not get lost in the math- read the textbook and attend lectures- homework and tests are majority context based with bits of math application- easy to contact outside of lecture- amazing | She's a really good lecturer who actually wants her students to succeed. It is clear that she is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. She's also very active in research so if you do well in class that could open doors for you. Overall, 342 was much harder than 341 but still manageable if you put in the work. | Hands down, professor Mcquinn is one of if not the the best professor I've had at Rutgers. For a stem professor, she explains stuff incredibly well in lecture, and the few times I had to go to office hours she explained stuff even more clearly. Also was very supportive when I was experiencing mental health struggles and was flexible with deadlines. | Professor Mcquinn is a really good professor. She knows the material really well. She is really helpful and wants you to do well in the class."
"Keeton, Charles","The professor truly enjoys teaching the subject and makes it engaging for students. 4 quizzes, 1 final, hw assignments, group projects. Quizzes and final slightly hard but prof tries to make sure everyone gets a good grade based off of multiple assignments. | This is labeled as a physics course but you don't do much physics in here besides Newton's basic laws. You will do much more of being able to critically think and work through problems. Pay attention during lectures and go to office hours if needed; He's open to working with students. | Really inspired me to continue studying astronomy after going through so many boring physics lectures. He makes every lecture engaging with his clicker questions and article assignments. Even has office hours right after class so you can sit with him for questions or going through homework! | Loved the class, prof was really interested in material and it shows. Keeton also was incredibly helpful during office hours, he would go in depth and answer any questions, while also helping you come to conclusions yourself. | For those interested in Byrne Seminars, I'd recommend any taught by Keeton. It's basically 1 free credit, as long as you show up and participate just a little bit. He's very knowledgeable and interesting. The only actual work I did was creating interview questions for a guest speaker as a group project. | Professor Keeton is a really good professor. He is so helpful for physics 345. He knows how to help you out and can teach you python for that class. The class is almost like a study hall where you can work on the assignments for the class and the group projects as well. He encourages collaboration as well with others. | Awesome teacher and awesome guy overall. Extremely kind and approachable. The class was fun but a little bit more difficult than I expected. However, having Professor Keeton made the class great. I highly recommend taking this class with him. | Great guy, class can be pretty tough. But the mid-term and the final are definitely easy. 30 multiple choice questions. Just review a bit and you will do fine. Attendance is mandatory with iClickers, but overall a pretty solid course. | Need more professors like Keeton at Rutgers. His class is very challenging and I think that is what I like the most about it. When you actually think about the questions you can come up with the right answer. You can survive without the book, but if it is also available in the library. Be prepared for some amazing demos throughout the semester. | Cool guy, very approachable makes a difficult subject easy to understand and fun. His demonstrations were engaging and his lectures are inspiring. I wish he taught more classes because he is one of the better professors at Rutgers. | This is the best professor I've had. He takes a simple subject and makes it amazing and mindblowing. Absolutely everyone in the class loved him (in a 200 people lecture hall). | I had Professor Keeton for Astro 109 and I can easily say it was one of the most fun and entertainiing classes I've had here at Rutgers. He loves astronomy so much and it shows when he teaches. He does awesome demonstrations and the material you learn is very interesting. If you want to take Astro, TAKE IT WITH KEETON! | LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM! Drops lowest grades. Gives extra credit. He really knows his stuff and can answer any question. Super helpful. Makes class fun and interesting by preforming demonstrations. You can tell he's passionate about astronomy. I wish he taught more classes here! | Professor Keeton is wonderful you'll love him! | He's the best!!!!!!!!! | Professor Keeton is a phenomenal professor! The clicker questions are redundant but all in all he is very entertaining and passionate about his work! Lots of study groups and chances to pick your grade up if you fall behind. | Amazing class and amazing professor!!Highly recommended for this course!!!!30 extra credits out of 100 and easy to get!!!!! | His class was the highlight of my semester. Extremely helpful and a great professor. Explains things thoroughly and in a way that is easy to grasp. Overall kind guy. Listen in lecture and do the clicker quizzes and you'll be fine. | The course was very interesting, but tough if you haven't taken physics since high school. Professor Keeton was very helpful during his office hours, as I kept a list of questions during class and he was able to clarify everything when I met with him afterwards. It is not the simplest of classes, but definitely possible to do well if you study. | Professor Keeton's class wasn't easy but if you studied the slides and go to class for the iclicker quizzes you should be fine. I didn't do so well on my exams but on the final, I did ok and was supposed to fail the class but he was kind enough to pass me with a C. He curves so that's a plus! Loved him as a professor! | I really ended up hating this class. Your final grade really depends on how well you do on the midterm and final which are quite tough. He also gives I-Clicker questions quizzes every class so attendance is mandatory. His class ended up hurting my GPA though so take this class if you're only interested in astronomy. | prof is really nice, and he will go out of his way for you to understand the concepts, his exams are challenging, but he curves. You can tell how much he loves astronomy/physics by his lessons. Overall a nice prof, and dont be afraid to ask him questions on things you dont understand, he would be happy to help. | Great teacher. 2 tests both 25 question multiple choice. Also clicker quizzes. He goes over everything and wants you to understand and do well. He always has reviews before the test allowing you to ask anything. Plus his demonstrations rock. | Real nice dude. Exams were hard. Basically a physics class. didn't learn much about stars or planets | Professor Keeton is awesome! I only took Astronomy to fulfill a science requirement, but I'm so glad I did. Keeton is so enthusiastic about the subject and makes everything interesting with crazy demonstrations. His tests are challenging because they require more than just memorization, but I managed to get an A. Just go to class and read the book! | Very nice professor. Do the clicker questions and you're good | Keeton is definitely a much ""higher quality"" professor than most students at Rutgers might be used to. He bleeds enthusiasm for the subject matter, and always has some wacky demonstration prepared for class. While the class itself it fun, the exams are pretty hard. Almost everyone I know passed with a B. Recommended but not as a gpa boost! | I took this as an easy A and got a C+. I went to every class and read the textbook but I just don't like astronomy/physics. So if you're not interested in the topics, don't take this class. He is a good professor though. I just didn't like the topics and understand his questions. | Really good teacher, Makes the class fun, and it's an easy class. | This is an easy A course, as long as you goto lecture (iClickers and exams based off of lectures). He keeps class engaged and material is interesting. Recommend the course for a natural science elective. | Take keeton, he is a great professor and actually engages the students. Great class demonstrations, study by rereading the book for the exams. There are two a midterm and final. | I deff recommend this class! Keeton is the sweetest professor I've ever had! He explains everything really well and his lectures are always entertaining. He's very kind to his students and this was BY FAR the easiest course I've had at RU, and I'm a history major. He's adorable! | He is an extremely intelligent guy. Getting an A is certainly possible but you have to work for it hard. Don't expect to do well by taking the class lightly | It's obvious that Keeton genuinely wants his students to learn. The numerous in-class demonstrations, well-organized lessons, and thought-provoking discussion questions attest to that fact. Go to class each day - not only because you have to (daily clicker questions on light readings), but also because his lectures are fascinating and informative. | Great professor, a very structured class and you learn so much. The subject matter isn't overwhelming and he is just a pleasure to watch lecture. He has a deep interest in astronomy and it's extremely evident in his lectures not to mention that the presentations in the class are great. | What a great guy. He takes astronomy and makes it so enjoyable for students. Clicker questions every class, but you get to discuss the answers before submission. You really learn a lot because you are extremely prepared for exams. I would take him again if I could! | Keeton loves astronomy and loves teaching it. It was a very interesting class. Iclickers every day. they suck! but sit around with people and discuss answers. he is easy if you try. and he has a curve of the overall scores of the class. i hated him at first but you love him by the end of the class. loved the visual examples! TAKE HIM | ok, i didnt get an A, but it is very attainable. go to class, iclickers do help a lot. hes a great teacher, great guy, very flexible, do the recommended textbook probs 20 mins b4 class and you should be good [its typically 5 book Qs at most]. dont let the easiness of the class get past you. it was a good class, minus an annoying classmate -___-. | OMG this class is so hard! DO NOT listen to anyone who says that the class was easy...a lot of these people already know a lot about astronomy. YOU HAVE TO ATTEND ALL THE CLASSES because he takes attendance and on top of that there are clicker questions everyday (33% of your grade)! Also you have to keep up with TB reading. Def. not an easy A. | Perhaps the best professor at Rutgers (science class wise atleast). This guy has a genuine interest in teaching and has a passion for astronomy. Seriously this guy is the nicest and most down to earth professor you'll ever meet. Just read the book and attend his lectures. Some tricky questions on his exam but the rest are straight forward. | Hated all types of science, but because of NS requirement, had to take...something! So happy I took this class - it is so-o interesting, and Prof Keeton blows everything out of this world (pun intended). He's a great professor, and makes astro seem exciting. Fun, easy (if you try), mandatory attendance (clickers!) -- but it's all worth it! | Great Professor & Knows How To Teach. | I love him!! He is a really good professor. He's presentations are always organized and clear. It's easy to do well on the clicker questions. Although I dont really like astronomy, I still really recommend to take him!! | best teacher at rutgers hands down if you can fit his class in take it it will boost ur gpa and you will have fun in the process. we all know tht rutgers is insanely difficult but he makes it easy and loves his job. take his class you wont be upset tht you did. such a great man | I loved him! He was great in this class and you had many opportunities to get points (lots of clicker points and bonuses). He made the material easy to understand and genuinely seemed interested in his students. I recommend him. | keeton rocks! really really helpful and clear, and genuinely loves his work. makes lectures really interactive and fun. highly recommend taking any of his classes! | Professor Keeton absolutely loves his job. His lectures are pretty interesting but can be somewhat a little too intensive at times. Attendance is a must since a third of your grade is iclicker quizzes. There is a midterm and final. Both are challenging but a curve is applied post-semster. Keep up with your notes and homework and you'll do fine. | Professor Keeton is a very organized and intelligent professor. He is an extremely good teacher and clearly loves his job. There are a lot of formula derivations that can be long winded if you're not taking this class as a requirement. HWs are 60% of your grade and can be difficult at times-- he really wants you to think them through. Good prof! | Every class should be taught like this!Astro gets a little dizzying sometimes, but the fact that Prof Keeton drops your 2 lowest homeworks, posts comprehensive lectures notes online, and gives you a take home final definitely helps when the more difficult material is covered. In spite of this, this course definitely isn't a fluff class. | Keeton is absolutely awesome!! He is so patient and kind to students, especially those who attend his office hours. Whenever the grader for homework grades us harshly, he gives some points back if fairly deserved. He received a teaching award this year. Congratulations, Professor Keeton!! You deserve it and keep up the good work!!"
"Gershtein, Yuri","I TOOK HIM WITH PHYSICS 227 BUT HES AMAZING TAKE HIM PLEASE | The class itself is a hard class. Professor Gereshtein is not bad for the class. He answers questions during lectures. There is a curve for the class. A grade of an 78 or higher can possibly get you an A in the class. He is good person. | Gershtein is very hard, but I really like him and hope I have him again. His grades aren't only based on the number you get: subjective factors like attendance, participation, and improvement during the semester also impact your final grade, so go to class and make sure you ask questions. | Yuri is a good man. Despite the fact that he might go off the topic sometimes, he would never make fun of any student for asking a dumb question or making a statement that's considered stupid by the profs. He introduced me to interesting stories about Chernobyl and I remember it even today. | Gersh is a good professor. Although like most college lectures, they can get pretty boring at times. Electricity and Magnetism is a hard enough course as it is. Gersh does not make it harder than it needs to be. Kind of a funny guy too. | Most in-class examples were straight from the book, but his added insight is helpful. Was willing to answer questions about problems found in the text or elsewhere, and if time did not permit he would solve it and upload the solution to the class site. Open door policy for office hours, approachable and friendly. Exams difficult, but passable. | Extremely unclear, doesn't like to answer questions posed to him in class. Goes off on a tangent and never answers what you ask. Teaching methods are confusing and ineffective, also bad at getting people interested in lessons. His class actually caused me to switch majors, and I wasn't doing that bad beforehand. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU CAN. | The curve is different every year but this year even a C- became an A. After the first exam you will not believe that the curve is so generous for this class, but trust me, after the second exam you will understand. You may think you are failing but try your best and don't worry too much because although the class is hard, the curve really is good | Very smart but isn't good at teaching. Very enthusiastic and always ready to help. Didn't do great in the class but not hard to get a good grade if you put in effort. | Super nice guy. Actually wants you to go to office hours and tries to help. He's very quirky and may seem disorganized, but he has good teaching methods. He teaches the concept, asks if it makes sense, then you do an iClicker question. Cool demonstrations. | He's new to teaching but is a nice guy. Tries to teach, but often goes into superfluous detail regrading calculus which is hard to understand. He has some pretty good demonstrations. Takes attendance using I-clicker questions, which you don't have to get right. Just read the book, do some example problems, use work and energy, and you'll be fine."
"Cizewski, Jolie","Through well-prepared lectures and homework, Professor Cizewski has greatly increased my appreciation and understanding of Modern Physics. Mod Phys. isn't easy for beginners but with Cizewski's preparations before every class, understanding the material became a breeze. Watch lectures before class, homework is done in class, final paper, no exams. | Her lectures are boring and make everything so complicated. Extremely hard exams with no curve! Just make a large range of C at the end, so most students can just pass this class. Too many stuff to do in recitations. TAs are knowledgeable but arent allowed to help you in recitations with collabs or solve problems on the board, so not helpful. | The most useless lectures that Ive ever seen. Just reads those unclear slides from the screen. The exams are super hard and tricky. Most people end up with a C in this class or in the best scenario a B. Never saw the professor or the TA actually prove or solve something on the board."
"Somalwar, Sunil","Professor Somalwar is a very good lecturer. He speaks clearly and concisely. He teaches with such finesse. Even if he is teaching something trivial, he still finds a way to make you engaged and not want to turn your head awaIf you are a physics major consider taking his intermediate quantum mechanics class or any class he teaches. You will miss out | Amazing professor. Clear and organized. Example problems make the material clear. Come to class and participate because it does affect your final grade. Somewhat lenient during test grading. | Physics 381-382 Classical Mechanics. Sunil is brilliant and well versed. He is a leading researcher at CERN and it it pretty clear why. A problem solver and a half. Incredible insight/intuition. Very clear in his lectures, but goes fast so dont blink. | One of the finest teachers I've ever had. Sunil explains physics with extraordinary clarity. Attendance is optional, but go anyway. His lectures are very enlightening and go well beyond just the necessary class material. Hw is short, exams are extremely easy and straightforward IF you know the material; he never gives tedious math calculations. | Best Professor at Rutgers. A teacher who truly challenges his students and desires for us to learn to question and analyze. Took him for Global Warming Honors Seminar, and loved it. He said first class, ""Don't give me a reason not to give you an A."" Got an A. | I thought that the Greenhouse Effect was pretty easy (I'm a liberal arts senior) and the homework was relatively light. Wants you to do well, very accessible. Class can be a little monotonous, but he didn't take attendance. | on another rating site he had a lot og good ratings..so i took his class and hes a great guy...very accomodating....pretty easy class but the material is pretty easy...says that hes gonna give A's and B's and i believe him.."
"Zimmermann, Frank","The lectures were boring, and the professor just read off the slides. I-Clicker questions were not straightforward, and you were only given 60 seconds to answer them. Most of this class is self-study, and the actual exams were much harder than the practice exams. Exams were not curved despite low scores. Avoid taking physics with this professor. | Attendance is mandatory in this class because he uses I-Clickers which you have to pay to use and have trick questions. Exams are difficult and averages are very low. Homework also costs money to complete. The lectures are boring and not useful. Mostly have to self study this class and learn on your own. Do not recommend. | FRANK is so amazing and funny professor he cares about u if u wanna put in the work. Physics will always be a hard class the people complaining were the ones who talked in lecture. Only bad thing is he uses iClicker | Please don't take him if you want your sanity. He doesn't know how to teach. His IClicker questions are out of the blue and very hard. His test questions do not match the practice test, textbook, the questions on his slide, or the iClicker questions. Organic Chemistry is better than this course (I am taking both at the same time). | AVOID THIS PROFESSOR any good reviews are from the glazers, do not trust them. He is very awkward in lecture and has a very tiny voice, hard to even understand. He does not tell the exam format until 5 days before the exam. Unclear grading criteria, you don't even know where you stand on the class. | He's great at explaining every of the concepts and he was very willing to help you if you were interested! | This professor made me want to jump in front of the oncoming REXB. This man CANNOT teach, CANNOT articulate himself, it was so bad that it was hilarious. How did this man get a job, and how did this man NOT get fired after bunch of complaints. DO NOT take his class if you want a happy life, AVOID him at any cost. | The entire class is him reading off of slides. Makes what could be an interesting class extremely boring and stressful. Speeds through important slides while staying too long on non important ones. Uses iClicker to grade attendance and knowledge. Unsympathetic towards issues with iClicker and won't give credit if an iClicker glitch occurs. | this man made me want to cry. im studying for an exam rn and oof | Lecture are pointless as he just reads off slides but you are forced to go for the clicker questions. The clicker questions aren't the easiest (definitely doable) but he gives no where enough time for them. Most of the times he does not cover the material needed for the hw or recitation so get ready to do it all yourself. | Had Zimmerman for 4 semesters and is honestly one of the better professors I've had. While his lectures are dry like his humor, they are none the less informative and at times very entertaining. My advise: Study from practice exams, write down I-clicker answers, and study lecture his lecture slides. Put in the effort, and you're on your way to an A | He is a generic dull lecturer. He just reads the slide and doesn't explain the POP quizzes properly. However the physics class (phy227 fall) in general was ok, the recitations were useful and the final grade was curved generously. You can get an A with a 78. Oh his lectures require those stupid iclickers which should've been replaced by an app. | Probably the worst lecturer I've ever come across at Rutgers. Let's just put it this way. You know he's garbage when a TA (who works directly under him) attested to his mediocrity in front of a class full of students saying he slept through all of Zimmermann's lectures. More specifically, though, he mumbles and just reads off slides with 0 effort. | This guy mumbles through lecture and blows through slides. If ure not versed in physics, he will make sure u remain a bad physics performer. His beeming eyes lace the class as he hurries through EVERYTHING. I had to get out this class. | A good lecturer. Participation in lectures are mandatory. Do the assignments, go to the lectures, do the quizzes, review for the exams, and do your best. The extent are not really that hard, but make sure u work hard because the assignments and tests could be challenging. | Best physics professor I have ever had. Very helpful during office hours. | He is really amazing and one of the best. If you don't understand him because he may be to fast for you, just be courageous and ask. He is very kind and takes his time to explain to you. He loves physics and he lives for his physics. | Professor Zimmermann has very dry lectures where he focuses on parts of physics that matter the least rather than focusing on the bigger concepts. All of the exams aren't meant to test your knowledge of physics. Rather it is to test how well you can apply 4 formulas and cross stuff out until you're left with one thing. | This class was so hard, workshops dont help AT ALL, they just confuse the material even more. Slides consist of complicated endless equations that don't explain anything. Quizzes every week, boring lectures, homeworks are so hard. You have to take this class if you're an engineer. | makes lectures so confusing, quiz every week (not easy but short), heavy lectures and confusing equations. Homeworks are the worst | He reads off the slides in lecture and does not add any extra information in them. Homework every week, but it helps with exams. For exams just do all the past practice problems and they usually show up again. Recitation is horrible and does not help at all. I failed every quiz in recitation and got a 72 and 64 on exams. | Lectures contain all the concepts that will appear on the exam. But you're the one who has to accustom yourself to utilizing it in the way the exams want you to. Just do the old exams to get used to how to approach the questions. This class was pretty much a joke. | Decent lecturer, don't expect the homework(mastering physics) to relate to tests at all. If you go over previous exams, which he has online, you'll do fine. Also, lecturers are mandatory, or you won't get credit for iClickers. | Cool guy. Nice to have teachers that are actually passionate about their jobs. | He is hilarious! His test are multiple choice exams so the grading is standard fro everyone taking the course. His experiments during class time are very entertaining, He teaches pretty clear, but you obvi. have to put work into it. tests are we took in 2015 were barely similar to the previous exams but there are common questions. Do the HWs !!! | He's a nice guy who knows what he's talking about. Lectures are mostly reading a power point but he has iClicker questions , physics demos and a touch of humor to help mitigate the boredom. | His lectures are very interesting. There's weekly homework online and iClicker questions in the lectures, but a lot of people have friends do it for them. For the homework, just get a pdf of the solution manual and maybe a chegg account if you don't want to do them. The slides are clear and posted online. The workshops are a BIG chunk of the grade! | Relatively good teacher. Doesn't speak clearly though. | Believe it or not: Zimmerman prepares you for higher-level physics courses in 228. You'll get more out of lectures by asking questions, taking notes (on what's said, not what's on slides as they're posted online), and sitting somewhere you won't get distracted. That said, the exams are difficult but doable if you keep a steady studying habit. | Professor Zimmerman is a really nice guy and he really seems like he knows what he is talking about but sometimes it is hard to understand, and it's very likely it is just because of the difficulty of the class. He does great demos in class, unfortunately a lot of kids in class talk over him which can get annoying. | For exams, there is no partial credit because they only grade the scantron. He speaks very fast in lecture and lets students walk all over him during lecture. Does not explain things well. Additionally, the recitations for his analytical physics course are hideous. | best lecture to have on a friday. lots of disrespectful students to him especially through yikyak but he's a great professor. if you've taken ap physics c before this class is a breeze. pay attention to the clicker questions because they appear on the quizzes. | Honestly a very nice man, but a terrible teacher. He doesn't explain anything, and just gives you the formulas, so you have to teach yourself. It doesn't help that the TA I had, Collin, was very rude and unhelpful as well. He has no control over the class, and the students make fun of him the entire lecture, which is just sad to watch. Don't take. | Although attendance isn't ""mandatory,"" he does use the iClicker to check for attendance. He tries his best to be captivating and entertaining. A little quirky, but I truly don't mind his lectures. DEFINITELY missed him when Chandra subbed for him. Definitely look over past exams, as frequently the problems are very similar. Not too difficult. | Zimmerman's lectures are very boring, but he can be funny at moments and his demonstrations are awesome. iclicker for attendance. Getting a B isn't too difficult, but does require work. | In the end, I do believe I learned;however, his lectures were torturous. All he did was derive equations, offered no review or resources, and tests were kept a secret. Made the course unnecessarily difficult. | was my TA for physics203 recitation. he moves a bit fast for most students to keep up but still is extremely nice. his easy recitation quizzes were a big boost to my physics grade. FRANK IS THE MAN!!! | He is a nice professor. When my gramdpa died and I wanted to attend the funeral. He set up a special time for me to do the lab. I still thank him for his kindness. Keep up the good work Dr. Zimmerman. | He takes his time to explain clearly | get a breath mint dude. will basically walk u through the lab if you have b00bs. gives 9s and 10s on everything. | Helps as long as you ask. | He's really nice, and tries to help in lab, has no social skills, but the lab was really really easy. Doesn't seem to know that much though. | His lab classes are painful. | He really wants people to understand the topics and he helps with any possible question. He's a little too easy on grades, though: he will give you a 9 or 10 for any****ty report you give him. | Doesn't serve much of a function as a lab instructor other than to assign grades. Helps only sporadically with the experiment."
"Montalvo, Grace","Attendance is mandatory and the professor will give you questions in class and will grade you for it. Go to office hours if you are struggling in the class. After every lecture you have a homework assignment. If you have no other choice, best to take a different professor. Exams are very difficult and grading is harsh too. | He's fine online but in person lectures are sped through and not thorough at all- will flip through a multitude of slides in lecture and claim their just equations and not important- exams are difficult- his lectures just don't reach the level of difficulty and thoroughness that his labs, recitations and exams are at- hard to reach outside of class | Tests were hard but they were open note. Recitations were the best things since you have people to help you. The lectures were okay, they were just recordings so no chance to ask question. If you pay attention and ask questions in recitation, you will be fine. | Very good professor. Made time available during the week to meet and go over material; kind and willing to explain everything. Very accommodating with online class. Recommend skimming the textbook, then watching lectures. Very clear lectures and easy to understand. Wants students to do well. | While online learning this teacher had a quiz due every friday from 9:40pm to 10:00pm | took him for the summer session. didn't get much from lectures. have to marry the textbook. nice guy. exams were kinda hard i would study mostly from the textbook and the polling questions he has in class | I took physics 204 with him during the summer and overall he's a pretty solid professor. The exams are pretty similar to the lecture polls and recitation questions, so it's not that difficult to do well if you give yourself enough time to practice and study. However, the class isn't just memorization, but he's always glad to answer any questions. | He is an amazing professor. He tries his very best to help his students and makes you feel like he really cares. Exams are pretty straight forward. As long as you pay attention to him in class you will do fine. 100% will pick his classes again in the future. | Just a lot of math involved, I-clicker. and class activities | He is a nice and caring professor who will try his best to explain any question you might have. The class is a bit math heavy, did not expect this, as there are many conversions such as going from joules to calories, etc... Not too bad, as long as there is one smart person in your group. Also curves up lots of your overall grade. | Professor Montalvo was okay. His lectures are sort of useful but have iclickers. You can usually get away with not paying attention in class if you read the textbook. His office hours are very useful so go if needed. If you are able to do the iclickers properly and understand the conceptuals on the practice exams you should be fine for the exams. | He's really friendly and helpful. He explains problems in lots of detail. Never in a bad mood. You should definitely take a class with him. | An amazing professor, cares about student, generous with grades, friendly, and explains things very very very well. I wish all professors were like him."
"Koft, Julie","Dr. Ruth is an excellent, caring professor. She really cares about her students' learning. You will work hard and you MUST be self-motivated and present in class. As a result you will walk away with more ""bang for your buck"" and possibly even have a new friend in Dr. Ruth by the end of the semester."
"Baker, John",John is a really nice guy who will willingly help you throughout the semester. To get a good grade you just have to take his feedback on your papers and really use it. He will let you out early some classes too | Great professor. Just follows the department's rules and all but tries to help you as much as he can. And you can always email him with any questions and he writer back with goof advice. | He is SO nice & pretty funny too. He does whatever he can to help you write a good paper. Sometimes even lets students out early!
"Shang, Fangze","Professor Wei Shang was the most amazing teacher I've ever had! , I specifically tried to take as many classes as I could with him, students are very lucky to have access to such a knowledgeable person that interacts with his students. Dr. Shang was like a mentor to me as a mature student and I'm grateful for all his experiences and help! | His class is great! Many thanks to Dr. Shang! | Great guy! He is willing to answer any questions and help. | Wei is the real deal. Super knowledgeable and has real industry insight. His courses aren't easy but if you're there to learn and put in the effort you'll do well. The people that complain about him are just plain lazy and expect to ace his course anyways. Do your work and absorb as much from him as possible. He is one of the best at CBU! | He is very knowledgeable in Petroleum Field. His teaching level way much higher than any other reported university . | Dr. Wei is a very intellectually valuable professor to the Petroleum industry. He teaches most of the petroleum engineering core courses at CBU; Drilling Eng, Reservoir/Advanced Reservoir Eng, petroleum simulation. He is inspirational in his teachings and every student benefits well beyond the course material. Definitely Recommend. | Simulation is beneficial to every petroleum student. that will help you to understand how to transform from the petroleum to gasoline and diesel oil. the wei shang is consientious, he fine the most appropriate teaching material and method to match the levels of the students and what they need. | the PETR2161 is the Reservoir Engineering , It is to teach us to use Reservoir's software and the Dr. wei shang is very friendly to every students. We have students in many different countries and everyone is treated the same in his class. | the DR. Wei is a brilliant man of wide learning, the PETR 1161 is the Drilling engineering, it is very Professional courses, but when I have any problem, he is always patient to help me, I benefited greatly from him. | Dear Dr Wei Shang, you are trully a 3 /10, i gave you three just because you read the slides and give good marks to people who praises you. | people who say that Wei Shang is a good prof, i have no idea what you are talking about. Wei never made sense to me at all, i don't know if it is the language problem or he is just not meant to be a professor. he is indeed very outdated and he doesn't test your intelligence but your attendance. | A great professor with vast knowledge and experience. CBU should be grateful to have a professor like Dr. Wei Shang. You have my respect. | A good grade is not the same as a good education. Some students want to just have Wei give us the answers and then regurgitate it on the test. His goal is to help us find meaningful employment so every lecture is packed with helpful information for future job interviews. Approach education with an open mind and Wei will not disappoint. 6/5 | I graduated from a program in Ontario but Wei is the absolute best professor I had. He encourages, challenges and supports us with an incredible knowledge of petroleum. He gave whole lectures on topics i asked about. He's given me the opportunity for a bright future that i never imagined possible for myself. Wei's the only reason to come to CBU. | This professor is outdated, he wants you to show up to class even though all he does is reading slides. If you ask a question, he always goes off topic and explains things that you don't need. I remember one day he took almost 10 mins to explain how his friend stayed at ""doubletree by Hilton hotel"". He had to write the name on the board. | Wei shang is simply not a good educator. | He is really not a good person or professor. He has his own old school world. He is very complicated | Great personality, always smiling, and very knowledgeable. Unfortunately, his classes were a torture to endure, due to his weak English, he would spend 7 minutes per slide that can be finished in 1-2, resulting in 75 minutes of dullness and phone browsing. He is VERY outdated, does not communicate through moodle (his course isn't even there!) | Dr. Shang's class was pretty good. The prof was much more interesting than the class tbh. He has a ton of knowledge and experience that he likes to share with his students. Dr. Shang also tries to pass on education/work opportunities that he gets through his sources in the field which is really awesome and generous of him. | Awesome prof, would take again in a heartbeat. Provided great feedback that aided me in doing well on the final and his course. | I took Dr Shang's class this year at CBU. It was very challenge for me. BUt Dr Shang was very helpful and he explain things very well. He is also verry passionate about Petroleum engineering in general. One of the best professor at CBU. | Great guy, fair grader, very good lecturer. Likes to get to know his students. Dr. SHang's class was pretty easy but you'll learn lots of things in it. Don't expect to do well if you don't do the work or the readings though. | Dr. Shang's class was excellent. It was very relevant to the petroleum program at CBU. Dr. Shang was overall a great professor as he went over the topics very thoroughly and he was always willing to show me what was expected to succeed in his class. Tests were fairly comprehensive and a bit challenging if you don't pay attention in class. | Dr. Shang's class was honestly one of my favorite classes that I have taken so far at CBU. This was mostly because the prof was extremely skilled at relating concepts to the students. Dr. Shang went over many advanced concepts but he will readily take time to make sure you understand them. The tests were challenging but he marked very fairly. | Great guy, know's his material front and back. Would take his class again anyday. | He knows the course material very well and he makes it easier to understand. He is always available outside of class for assistance on homework or labs. Many thanks to Wei! | Wei is the most passionate teacher I have had in the petroleum program. His methodology of teaching is second to none. | An excellent prof. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. He is always encourage students to ask questions in his class. | Wei is an excellent professor. I would strongly recommend taking courses with him. He is very knowledgeable of the topics that are covered in the courses. He's always open to suggestions and wants success for his students. He is also available out of class for extra help and discussions about class topics or anything related to our program. | Wei Shang is a huge asset to the petroleum engineering department. He is very knowledgable in all the topics we discuss. Readily available to discuss and help with problems outside of class. I would highly recommend taking courses from him. Looking forward to further leaning with him. | Honestly the attention to detail in each lecture is astonishing, it's very obvious he knows the material from bottom to top, without revision or scanning of his documents or doc's notes. very understanding and accommodating to questions. looking forward to other courses with him. | he is a great teacher and I really enjoyed being in his class :) | The best Professor currently instructing in the petroleum department. Highly recommend that everyone takes one of his courses if presented with the opportunity. | Very knowledgeable and extremely fair in marking. Wei has a great deal of experience in working in the oil and gas industry and has quickly become one of my favorite Professors in the Petroleum Engineering program. I would highly recommend you take a course from Wei. You may learn a thing or two you would not have otherwise. | I am taking this course with Dr. Shang this winter. I find out his teaching is very interesting. He is very knowledgable and always try to help students."
"Bhanot, Gyan","I took his class fall of 24 and it was great he really went out of his way to teach us things he thought we could use in our future. He also acknowledged that the material he was teaching was by nature difficult, walked us through class problems, and offered help after class if anyone needed | I took his class fall of 23 and it was great he really went out of his way to teach us things he thought we could use in our future. He also acknowledged that the material he was teaching was by nature difficult, walked us through class problems, and offered help after class if anyone needed | I took this prof for elements of physics; his first sem teaching the class. Awful lecturer but is very available outside class for help. Lots of self study for this class. Lecture notes are not very helpful and stray away from actual content on exams. Best practice is the homeworks and practice midterms posted. Textbook is too easy compared to exam | Ridiculous homework/test questions. He expects you to understand concepts taught in genetics, linear algebra, MATLAB, and many other subjects that are not prereqs. Many questions he gives on homework/tests is are complete curveballs that are considerably different from examples done in class. And there were only about 12 total in-class examples. | From what I've experienced, he is the worst professor i've ever had. He teaches so poorly that you can't tell if you are the who can't understand or if he just does not possess the skills to teach. He THROWS material at you with little explanation. Annoyingly, he teaches like we've taken certain classes (not prereqs) making it very hard to learn! | Very kind and passionate professor. He wants his students to actually learn the material. Though class material was difficult, hard work can get you through."
"Zanzoul, Sarah","useless/unreasonable homeworks. Error/misspelling in her slides sometimes. hard to get good marks. Wouldn't recommend, but if you take it make sure to go to every class. Some questions in her quiz come from clicker questions | You will have to work hard to pass her class. Great personality difficult teacher. Would not recommend taking. | Just to start, expos will be difficult no matter what teacher you take. However, Professor Sherman has a great personality and actually made me a much better writer. Great teacher, tough class. | She goes over a lot of important concepts during class so I would advise you to avoid skipping class cause it really helps with the essays. However, she is not an easy grader at all so do not expect an easy A or B because she is an extremely tough grader. Very young, funny, and energized teacher but it takes a lot of dedication to pass. | She is a nice person but a terrible teacher. | Hardest teacher ever. Great personality but very tough grader. She explains texts thoroughly but be prepared to work very hard on essays. Wouldn't choose this professor if you have other harder classes to focus on. | I think she was a tough grader because she was new to expos this year. I recommend going to tutoring because she is a tough, but fair grader and it will help. You definitely need to put effort in to pass with her. Her feedback is pretty useless until paper 3 when she actual tells you how she wants the papers written but she does help if you ask."
"Zhakenova, Yelena","She is not THAT bad like what others are talking about. After all, this is somewhat a demanding class especially for those whose native language is not English. But, she will help you if you are willing to try. I wouldn't say she is the easiest grader, but she grades quite fairly. | Avoid this professor. She is unwilling to help and discourages you from doing well in her class. She is the MEANEST professor in the history of Rutgers. DO NOT GET HER FOR ANY CLASS or prepare to fail | O GOD! she grades way too critically on essays. she's really hard and strict. She is really helpful though if you need extra help and is always willing to stay after class but it never helped me=( I failed my first 3 essays in a row. hate this dam class. | she's very strict...very very strict..."
"Bartynski, Robert","This is by far the hardest class I've ever taken. I went to every lecture, but when I got to the homework I couldn't seem to figure out most of the problems without looking them up. Worst exams I've ever taken. Midterms are only 8 questions each and no partial credit is offered. I tried different study methods for each exam but could not improve. | Don't expect to learn anything from him. With an engineering course load and no way to avoid taking him via another professor it was terrible to take this class. Make sure to review the exam preps and midterms for every scenario and still expect what you see on the exam paper to be different. If you can avoid him, do it. | 227 as others may have described is a very challenging course. While he tries his best to explain the concepts, lectures were still very confusing and most of the learning was done with outside resources. He does do a midterm replacement policy for the final exam, but he also makes the final considerably harder. | we had 2 midterms both multiple choice and 8 questions, so each question wrong was pretty much a letter grade. the exams themselves were structured like the exam preps although there was no supplemental study material for the exams. We were kinda just left on our own to figure it out. Lectures are pretty much useless. | Physics 2A is a notoriously hard class and I definitely struggled. He's a good professor and rewatching his lecture videos helped me out a lot but just know that the exams are much harder than the homework. There is a generous curve but get ready to put a lot of time and effort into this class if you want to pass let alone get a good grade. | The lectures were not that good. I had to learn everything from the textbook. The exams weren't really like the homework. They were most similar to the in-class poll questions that he had to skip half the time because he didn't have enough time to get through the lecture. | A good professor, but lecture often was not helpful enough. For physics 227 we were given grade replacement on the final exam which was quite helpful. He was also a kind professor, and made lectures interesting by doing live examples of whatever topic the lecture was about. The class also finished with a very generous curve. | Bartynski is knowledgeable in what he's teaching, but his lecture slides are too confusing to read. Lecture attendance is mandatory, but he doesn't have enough time to finish, so he posts a video of the lecture later during the week. The class was structured to overwhelm students, and it's disappointing that IIA is on a different level than IA/IB. | WORST PHYSICS PROFESSOR EVER, DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM IF YOU DON'T WANNA HATE PHYSICS. | I loved this professor. He was very engaging during lectures, made sure to have office hours available, and made very good slides. He often spent a little too long on some topics during lecture and went a little over but I was ok with that. He answers questions clearly and is very helpful when asked. Homework was hard. | Bartynski is a great guy, but his lectures were kind of difficult to understand and I found myself learning more from Recitations and Homework. Bartynski did put effort into improving the class however, you can definitely tell he wants the best for his students. Exams were multiple choice and easy, but averages on them were very low. | Bartynkski seems like a really cool guy who has absolutely no desire to teach. He told us that he was not there to teach us, he was only our tour guide, telling us what we should be learning. He stayed true to his word. The midterm averages were both 47 and I got a C in the class with a 52. You will learn nothing from him, but the curve is great. | Amazing prof with super easy tests. Try to take him if you can he makes physics a walk in the park. Tbh the class is the difficulty level of taking candy from a baby. | Note all the good ratings were over a decade ago. Terrible lecturer. The class average on both exams were 48%, a few people get a higher score and skew the grades. HWs are unnecessarily long. This material can be interesting but prof. makes it very dry. He does try to make things fun by doing the demonstrations. Hope the curve passes everyone. | Prof bartynskis lectures were overall completely unhelpful, he did have a few cool demonstrations and he does try but he just can't teach. This is a very hard class and having a bad professor can make or break the class for you. | He's an excellent lecturer. He explains the concepts in a way that makes physics very easy to understand. However, it's hard to pay attention on a Friday afternoon, which are the only classes offered. Uses I-clicker so class is mandatory. Tests are generally easy but studying is needed to do well in his class. | Awesome | Professor Bartynski is an excellent lecturer. He goes out of his way to shut up the talkers during lectures. Exams aren't too bad. Understand the material and think about it thoroughly and you'll be fine. Also, do all the online homework. | He teaches well and he is clear. He is kind of fun and he will help you if you ask questions. His exams are not too bad, he asks questions on the important stuff (not some random difficult question). You have to come to lecture to get an iclicker score. | Very good professor in Physics. Actually went out of his way to shut up talkers in lecture and had a nice pace in lecture. Best of all, he does have some good jokes and the skits (like the Halloween one) helped by taking a break from notes. | AWESOME PROF! Teaches concepts really well and shows you where everything comes from! can be confusing at times, but most of the confusing items don't appear on exams. The homework is mandatory and in class you use an iclicker, so go to class and do the homework! Halloween lecture is the best! | He's a really nice guy and is a great professor. One of my favorite profs this semester. But the exams are hard, and he teaches the concepts. You gotta do the work and practice problems to do well on the exams. Do the online homework, it REALLY helps. | a really nice guy and a good teacher. has social skills (as opposed to most physics profs) and really does want everyone to do well. make sure you do the homework though, i didn't and he told me that it really does affect your grade. overall, one of the best professors ive had for physics classes. | Excellent demos teacher. Wait for halloween! Praise god you don't have Devlin. | Work hard and you'll get an A. He is not out to fail anyone (unusual for a physics teacher)"
"Hijazi, Hussein","If anything, it is a privilege to have Dr. Hanafi for a Core Engineering class. While it may be discouraging (my scenario) at first b/c he tells the truth to you, he never gives up encouraging you to study hard. He may sometimes rush the course contents (mostly at the end), but every lecture is worth attending as Dr. Hanafi is extremely passionate. | dont know the course | FIRST TWO WEEKS LOOK EASY. BUT TOO MUCH HOME WORK, LAP REPORT AND ALSO HARD EXAM. | Teach u basic staff but exam will be impossible. very poor grader. and distribution of course is extremely poor. Try to avoid him | Professor is nice but I would say it is not the best senior design course. This course has nothing to do with previous course and exams are from out of nowhere. Too much class work for such as exams, hws, lab, project, and etc. | This professor helps you until you know the stuff. He wants every students in his class to succeed. Course is a little bit tough and you have to attend every class. There are homeworks in every class, but you will find very helpful."
"Roy, Ananda","Attendance is mandatory and the professor will give you questions in class and will grade you for it. Go to office hours if you are struggling in the class. After every lecture you have a homework assignment. If you have no other choice, best to take a different professor. Exams are very difficult and grading is harsh too. | He's fine online but in person lectures are sped through and not thorough at all- will flip through a multitude of slides in lecture and claim their just equations and not important- exams are difficult- his lectures just don't reach the level of difficulty and thoroughness that his labs, recitations and exams are at- hard to reach outside of class | Tests were hard but they were open note. Recitations were the best things since you have people to help you. The lectures were okay, they were just recordings so no chance to ask question. If you pay attention and ask questions in recitation, you will be fine. | Very good professor. Made time available during the week to meet and go over material; kind and willing to explain everything. Very accommodating with online class. Recommend skimming the textbook, then watching lectures. Very clear lectures and easy to understand. Wants students to do well. | While online learning this teacher had a quiz due every friday from 9:40pm to 10:00pm | took him for the summer session. didn't get much from lectures. have to marry the textbook. nice guy. exams were kinda hard i would study mostly from the textbook and the polling questions he has in class | I took physics 204 with him during the summer and overall he's a pretty solid professor. The exams are pretty similar to the lecture polls and recitation questions, so it's not that difficult to do well if you give yourself enough time to practice and study. However, the class isn't just memorization, but he's always glad to answer any questions. | He is an amazing professor. He tries his very best to help his students and makes you feel like he really cares. Exams are pretty straight forward. As long as you pay attention to him in class you will do fine. 100% will pick his classes again in the future. | Just a lot of math involved, I-clicker. and class activities | He is a nice and caring professor who will try his best to explain any question you might have. The class is a bit math heavy, did not expect this, as there are many conversions such as going from joules to calories, etc... Not too bad, as long as there is one smart person in your group. Also curves up lots of your overall grade. | Professor Montalvo was okay. His lectures are sort of useful but have iclickers. You can usually get away with not paying attention in class if you read the textbook. His office hours are very useful so go if needed. If you are able to do the iclickers properly and understand the conceptuals on the practice exams you should be fine for the exams. | He's really friendly and helpful. He explains problems in lots of detail. Never in a bad mood. You should definitely take a class with him. | An amazing professor, cares about student, generous with grades, friendly, and explains things very very very well. I wish all professors were like him."
"Burkhart, Blakesley","Absolutely amazing! She talks about the film industry and the standards you need to keep up with, so if working in the film industry interests you, she will be the prof for you! She has had experience! Defiantly one of the best instructors I have ever had. Most, if not every project is group related, so be prepared to get to know your classmates! | A wonderful teacher who legitimately cares. She uses a great mix of lecture and hands on work. I loved learning from her. | Amazing. Ask her about the time she worked with Prince!"
"Vanderbilt, David","Many friends told me EM is a hard class, but in his class I seldom feel any difficulty. All materials are explained clearly. Lectures are well organized, and sometimes provide extra information on the website. Great professor! | If you want an easy-science class, don't take this. If you want an interesting class, don't take this. Hands down, don't take this class. | The class has in class demo's, do yourself labs, and homework, none of which help in the understanding of the material and becomes a waste of time. Boring lectures and difficult material when it is covered very quickly and poorly explained. The multiple choice tests are worded to trick you and not to test your overall knowledge of the information. | Had him for recitation, pretty good. He went over all of the important material before the weekly quiz and sometimes left it up on the board for the quiz. Can speak English well (a rarity for a Busch professor) and explains things very clearly. | Prof. Vanderbilt is one of the best professors I've ever had. What I liked the most in his way of teaching is how he can make a good visualization of stuff he is speaking about. He is very open to discussions and one can easily talk to him. I'm glad that I took both of his courses, because I've learned a lot on them, especially on SS2! | Clear presentation of the material, organized course, friendly guy | No Comments | A little dry. Teaches the most difficult and demanding courses. Extremely orgranized. Writes everything down. Tells you what you need to know for exams. Extremely helpful in office hour. Good guy."
"Mysore, Sachin",Mehta is an awesome law teacher. He will give you good feedback on your papers and tells you how you can improve on them. He trys his best to get the class motivated and interested in the material. He also sits down individually with each student to talk about your grades and how you can improve. He is always willing to help if you are stuck.
"Akhtar, Aimun","This class often feels like self-teaching due to unclear instruction and lack of support. Assignments are given with little guidance, and labs move too fast without hands-on help. Questions are often met with slick remarks, making it hard to seek clarification. A more structured, supportive & engaging approach would improve the learning experience | I took anatomy with her Summer 2023. The last exam was locked for me. I emailed her to open it for me and she condescendly accused me of missing the exam on purpose. She didn't even care enough to look into the situation for me even though it was a technical issue. She is very rude and not reachable at all! Avoid this professor at all costs."
"Falcone, Nicole","Goated lecturer whose very understanding and explains concepts well and thoroughly, understanding with late assignments and gives very clear feedback on grading. | The grade is mainly based on homework and three assessments. While topics can be challenging, Professor Pashley breaks down the topics clearly and is very open to feedback. Paying attention in class and understanding the concepts in homework will help you succeed. Recommend to any student taking statistics courses. | Hardest class in the MS sequence. Might as well make it enjoyable (to the extent that you can) Good balance between theory and application | She is definitely one of the best professors that I've ever had. She is knowledgable, caring, extremely good at simplifying hard concepts to make them easy to understand and also explains everything clearly. She provides great slides for lectures. Attending the lecture and reviewing the slides will help you succeed."
"Chainani, Shailendra","After reading others reviews I was a bit spectacle of taking this class. Since the hours fit I had no choice. Overall I'm glad I did, he's an amazing prof and very understanding as long as he sees your putting you best foot forward. Give him a chance | Great professor ! He actuallys explains everything in detail a little boring but overall really good . He prepares you for every exam would deff take him again | The class was almost 3 hours long and I swear he's one of the most boring professors I've ever had. He goes on and on and ends up off topic. Didn't explain the activities given in detail, at least the final exam and other exams were online. | he gives a lot of reading and the quizzes are kind of complicated"
"Mendelsohn, Eric","Managerial Acc is a course that many people struggle with, yet prof gelsomin made it very easy to succeed. He offers a lot of help such as dropping 3 lowest hw grades, dropping one of the lowest quizzes, and also curves the exams. He also gives review packets before every exam that are extremely helpful. He's the best accounting prof I've taken | He is a very kind professor who tries to keep his students engaged. Recitations are super helpful. Gets exam grades back to you very fast. | ManagAcc is one of those classes you'll hear that a lot of RBS students fail, but he knows this class is hard and will do everything to help you. Literally everything he offers is helpful and he'll try his best to not bore you. If you're looking to pass this class I suggest him, everyone who seemed to fail their first time end up passing with him. | He is a very good professor. He cares about his student. The course is very hard, and he knows that. He will help you with anything that you need, but you need to put in the effort. 2 exams, 30% final, homework, 2 quizzes to help you prepare for the exams, and a group project. He tries his best to keep the class entertained for this boring class. | Professor Gelsomin is an amazing and understanding professor! Super nice guy who cares about his students. Offers a bunch of extra help outside of lectures and responds to emails ASAP. The exams are fair and mirror examples done in class. Even though attendance is not mandatory, you will need to go to class to do well on the exams."
"Miller, James","Winder is a good choice for IFM. His exams were brutal and averages were in the 40s but he curves them crazy so as long as you get the average, you should be good. He assigns a final 12-15 pg research paper that counts for a big portion of your grade. He does not fail anyone so put in minimal effort, you are almost guaranteed a C or even a B. | Professor Winder is a really great professor. He has tons of experience in the financial industry. As long as you pay attention to what he says and write it down on top of reading powerpoints, you should be completely fine. I think his office hours are what really helped. Not many people showed up so I basically got tutored by him before every test | Very nice guy. You will actually learn something in this class that being said his Exams are very very HARD!!! If you can take some other class please do!! He was very understanding with deadlines, but his exams are very hard. Exams are mostly math-based. Don't take all your finance requirements in 1 semester. If you wanna learn prepare to STUDY!! | Took Prof. Winder online and synchronously. He actually wants you to learn and is very passionate! However, the exams were probably the hardest exams I have ever encountered in my life thus far. Luckily, he does a SUPER generous curve and will NOT fail you, as long as you complete all the homeworks, take the exams, and write the final paper. | Prof Winder is a financial economics veteran who oozes wisdom. His chief goal through his classes seems to revolve around generating critical thinking skills, and he emphasizes ""thoughtfulness"", whether it's through your papers or participation. Excellent professor, highly recommend if you want to learn. | Winder is probably the best professor in the business school. He's always willing to help you outside of class and shows he cares more about learning than grades, also a funny guy. Class consisted of two exams, a 12pg term paper, and HW is graded for completion. Have to work hard for an A, average exam scores are low 60s which translate to a B. | Easy to pass because he doesnt fail anyone unless you do literally nothing. Just write a decent paper, do all the hw (not even checked for correctness, just for completion and take the tests. Theres a curve for a B and A as well. If you actually want to learn hes a good guy, very well learned in the international markets | The most caring and compassionate professor at Rutgers Business School. Thinks outside of the box. A real gem. | I took this class for GMM and then Fixed Income. FI was definately harder then GMM. But the professor helps you with everything if you just talk to him. sweetest person ever, attendance isnt mandatory and hw u can hand in even late he doesnt take off points. the only thing that sucks is that he doesnt let u use ur laptop lectures are boring | One of my favorite professors at Rutgers. Really cares about his students. The tests are tough but the grading policy is very lenient. He just wants his students to learn the material. | I learned a lot from this class. Very nice guy. He is helpful too outside of class. two exams and a final. and one 12-15 page paper. the paper is worked on all semester though | He doesn't seem to care so much about grades, more about just teaching things he is genuinely interested in. He wants students to learn more than anything else. | Professor Winder is old-school, teaches from the board, doesn't post clear concise slides, so going to class is very much advised, although not mandatory. Also there's a 15 page paper that's due at the end of the semester, you get to pick your topic so it's not too hard to write. Exams are really hard, but I would take him again. | Absolute genius. Very interesting and insightful, but lectures can get dry. I did fall asleep in some of his lectures, but he never held it against me. If you speak every once in a while, he will learn your name and remember it. Class was 6 homeworks graded for completion, two exams, final paper. Exam questions based only off class examples. | I won't repeat what is already said below, but simply put - this is the best proffesor at RBS. Interesting lectures, extremely respectful and knowledgible, fair grader. This will not be an easy A class, but it will be one that you don't mind going to. Word of advice, forget about the textbook. | He is a very nice person and does a fine job teaching. He has the textbook memorized. He is very helpful, if you go to him for help with the paper thats 30% of your grade. His exams on the other hand are really hard. Average was near a 65% but thats a B and he doesn't fail anyone. If you want the A and do less reading go to class and pay attention | Easily one of the top two professors in the Business School. Extremely dedicated to students, and overall just a really nice guy. He manages to keep lectures extremely interesting, and he's a great storyteller. I would recommend him in an instant. All Finance majors should try to take his 490 course. | Very nice professor, teaches well. However,exams are very difficult. | One of top professors in Bus School. Great teacher, knows the material in and out, great person. Take him if you can. | Great teacher, nice guy, very passionate, always willing to help in office hours, fair grader, does reviews before tests. | I love winder. Had him for 3 classes and he's not an easy a but he is so kind and caring about his classthat its worth it. He always has a current eventin the begining of class and he brings real examples and stories. A bit slow but just sit in the front of class. There is a solid curve and the exam can be difficult but well written and thought out | He's a nice guy, does his job. Attendance is optional, tests are out of the book but don't rely on cough cough those things that everyone uses because he's not a fool and writes his own questions as well. Study a lot because the tests are challenging and only 20 questions multiple choice. The grades are curved at the end. | Winder is a great professor, he can be a little boring in class, but he genuinely wants to teach you about the financial world. Class is pretty basic, pay attention and you'll get an A. | Great Professor...just go to class and take notes, his exams have no surprises | Investment analysis is easiest class with him. other class not that easy. but I never even went to class for investment analysis and got an A | He was easy for investment analysis but I took Financial Markets and Instruments with him this semester thinking it would be an easy A, but it was not. He makes the exams very difficult for this course. You have the read the entire chapter and do every single homework problem if you want to do good with him in this class. | Very nice man with great real world experience. Lectures can be a little boring, but he knows what he's talking about and there are NO useless powerpoint slides. No homework, 1 group project and a midterm and final. I've had him for 2 classes and would take him again. | Very up to date on current events. Teaches without powerpoints, tests are all blue book. very helpful and accommodating."
"Andrei, Natan","She wasn't very good at lecturing and often went too fast, especially near the end. The slides were riddled with errors, but she was willing to fix her mistakes. My average for the iClicker was bad, but getting a 110 on the homework and doing well on the exams was easy. The exams are straightforward, with all problems coming from given problems. | Save yourself from taking this course with her. The course content is very interesting but you wont learn that from her. You'll be taught by the textbook in this class since the lectures are riddled with errors, at least sometimes they get corrected. But on the other hand the errors in the midterm review and final review solutions never got fixed:( | Genuinely do not take Eva Andrei if you don't have to. She makes consistent mistakes not only in the lecture material, but our quizzes and even MIDTERM REVIEW materials. No respect for students circumstances, she made me take an exam with COVID. It's clear she's just here for research. | completely disrespectful to me personally, and sets high expectations with lecture iclickers on the material we just learnt. | Incredibly hard!!!!!!!!!!! I had my intro to solid state class with her in my last semester of undergraduate and this was the most difficult class ever in my entire life! This class was not for average people. It 's for genius | The equipment was outdated and what was really wanted from the lab reports was made clear after they had already been graded. | Best class in all of Rutgers. Pretty hard tho. | I personally liked her. She may appear to be harsh but she in fact is a nice woman with kind heart. She made me learn so many things that are useful to my future. | gr8!"
"Jha, Saurabh","Professor Jha is one of the kindest professors ive had so far. He is funny, makes the lectures really engaging and includes lots of jokes in them and is also super passionate about the material, which makes you want to learn from him. Also hosts some in person demos which are fun to watch. Hw and tests are easy as long as you study. My boi, fr. | Amazing professor, interesting lectures. There's quizzes every lecture, and ur grade will go down if u miss a few. There's homework for every lecture as well. Don't take if you're not the type to go to every single lecture cause you'll need the points from the quizzes. | If you have a slight interest in our solar system and galaxies, take this class. It is an easy A as long as you show up to class and review hw and class questions prior to the midterm and final. He is a very caring and respectful professor who makes lectures interesting and funny so you don't have to sit through 80 minutes of boredom. | Great Professor with in-depth and coherent lectures. Lecture material is easy access if you miss it. Don't slack out on homework, homeworks for stars are long and challenging | I took his class Star formation, from the 400 level astrophysics rotation. Just like the rest of the astro department, very engaging professor. He provides great visuals for many concepts that may be difficult to understand, and answers questions in new approaches. His homework is long with derivation, but his exams are concepts from class. | Not only is professor Jha the sweetest and the most caring, but he's also an amazing lecturer. You can tell he loves the subject as a whole and teaching it. The homework is pretty light compared to other upper division physics courses, the topics are very interesting, and overall the class is pretty easy (assuming you put in the work, of course). | Professor Jha is a really good professor. He really wants you to do well in the class. He knows the material really well. | Jha is a really great professor. You can tell he cares about what he is saying while he lectures. His tests aren't hard as long as you read the text and lecture slides. I would recommend any person take this class, it is really fascinating and fun! | my favorite human being EVER, he's so funny & his lecture are very engaging. never a dull moment. he gives so much extra credit so DO all of it because the midterm & final are a little hard. he really loves what he does so snag his class, fight for an spn, its so worth it even if this is just a core requirement. in class quizzes are easy too | Jha is a great professor; he does his best to make the lectures interesting and entertaining, and he has a great sense of humor. He also gives lots of extra credit. The midterm and final exam aren't easy. but a good grade is definitely achievable. | Professor Jha is the best one I've met. His lecture is interesting and full of happiness. There's only a little bit homework but lots of extra credits. I trust you will have a interest in astronomy and get a nice grade after attending his course. | Professor Jha is an amazing professor whom I HIGHLY reccoment. He makes class really interesting. I took astronomy with him (& still am) and the way he teaches just reels you in. It's obvious that he cares for his students and gives many extra credit assignments. Passing his class is easy & you end up learning a lot! He's also very hilarious!! :) | Best professor ever!!!!!!! Even though I was not interested in astronomy, Professor Jha captivated me in every single one of his lectures. Every class began with two astronomy themed songs hence HE IS AWESOME. Wish I could take this class again! | Awesome guy, super friendly. Wants you to do well; doesn't curve and has online office hours before the midterm and final. Attendance is mandatory, you'll need an iClicker for the daily quizzes. Says the textbook is mandatory but I rarely used it, however I had a lot of prior astronomy knowledge so that might not be the case for everyone. | Very nice professor and a relatively easy class | He does a lot of fun demos and makes funny jokes, and getting an A requires very little effort. | Best professor I have had at Rutgers. He is super smart but also very kind, his enthusiasm for the material makes the class that much more interesting. Breaks down complicated concepts in a way that is easy to understand. The class reminded me how fun it is to learn. If you have the chance, take him, you won't regret it. | Great professor and great class! Read the text required and you will do well in the class and learn a lot. | His class is awesome and he's mad chill. He gives clicker quizzes every day but they're easy so long as you do the readings which are easy. He brings in his buddy Dave every once in a while to give us some physics demos which are always cool as hell. He gives a lot of extra credit and his exams are easy. I highly recommend his classes to anyone. | Very nice and relaxed guy. hes very enthusiastic and uses experiments to keep it interesting. attendance is worth a third of your grade. overall great teacher | Easy, knowledgeable, entertaining (cracks pretty funny jokes), pretty much everything you can want of a teacher. Attendance is mandatory due to clicker quizzes and it is a lecture-style class, but the class is really interesting. | Great professor - keeps students engaged and interested. Also has a good sense of humor and is an interesting guy. He even worked for the people who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2011! | He's a great teacher! I love him! Interesting classes with demonstrations during some classes to further clarify the lessons taught. His iClicker answers are funny too. He's adorable! Overall very helpful when it comes to exams. I highly recommend him!"
"Webb, Trinity","Nice lady, bad teacher. Ended up having to withdraw from her class. Problems she teaches does not match the tests at all. Quizzes are two questions each once a week, so if you miss one question you fail. I've always been bad at math but this class should NOT have been so difficult. | The difficulty level of this class is not very hard. The way she teaches is the main problem. She does not need to be a teacher. She doesn't teach well at all and all of the problems on the test are completely different than the problems in class or on test reviews. Everything can basically be taught on Aleks and youtube do not rely on her. | She is absolutley the worst instructor I have had so far. I eneded withdrawing from the course because she assumed we new the matierail and just wrote what she would consider notes, However they were just problems kind of hard to understand something when half of the class didn't know how to do it in the fist place. Do not take her! | Do not take her class. Horrible professor and she doesn't explain anything. I had to teach myself everything. Ended up withdrawing from the class because I was failing her class and couldn't bring up my grade. Tests are around 10 questions only and quizzes are all 2 questions. Get one problem wrong and you fail. Do whatever you can to not take her. | She sucks as a Math teacher, likable person, but horrible teacher! Have literally self taught myself everything, and HW is a lot, you will be doing assignments online before you even learn it in class. She writes the notes on the board but does not explain the steps, and quite often messes up. Take this online or another teacher. | I don't know how she teaches math, she ""messes up"" at least once every class even though she has notes of exactly everything she needs to teach us and needs to refer to it quite often. Makes sure the entire class time is used even if we finish the lecture early. Overall, choose another teacher who can teach math well because she ain't it. | I wish I took MAT111 online. I skipped all the lectures and just taught myself the material outside of class. This class was just a lot of homework/quizzes. | I wouldve been better off taking MAT 111 online without the lecture. My professor was no help to me at all, I taught myself everything anyways. | She's an okay choice. Not really a bad choice but not an amazing one either. Her lectures are kinda dry and the students had to correct her every once and a while but shes a fairly likable person. It's an easy class as long as you do the homework and study for the tests."
"Brooks, Alyson","Astrophysics major here, I genuinely enjoyed going to her class. The lectures were well put together and she is very open to answering questions or going back over something if you don't get it. If you're having trouble with the problem sets she is also very helpful during her office hours. 35% problem sets, 2*15% midterms, 20% final, 15%iClicker | Easy class, solid teacher, and really helpful | Definitely had to work hard on the problems sets she assigned, but if you pay attention in class and read the textbook, they're pretty doable. Also, working with other people makes it easier. She was really nice though and was really helpful. Also really smart and taught really well. | Astro-2: I am a not a physics major, but this class is interesting for physicists, engineers, etc . It's balanced (if you're not intimidated by lots of eqns) w theory & calculations. Although astro-1 is not a prereq, the book references some of the material from it. Plus, taking 341 before may help w the class structure and making friendsgroups. | Professor Brooks was fantastic. Non-physics major and I actually feel like I know what's going on. 60% problem sets, 20% exams, 20% clickers, if you form a study group for the problem sets there's no way to get a bad grade. Really interesting material taught by a great professor made this course great, definitely recommend."
"Lee, June","He's such a caring, sweet guy. I would definitely go to the lecture even though it not mandatory and go to his office hours if struggling. He genuinely wants to see you strive and succeed. | I had Jae Ki Lee as a TA for recitation. He is such as sweet guy and always made sure everyone understood the material before he moved on. When we have questions, he explains it super well. I actually learned more here than in actual lecture. Attendance is not mandatory, but you needed to show up to take the quizzes which were super easy. Take him!"
"Young, Benjamin","This was apparently his last semester teaching at Rutgers :( Had him for Graph Theory. Professor Gunby is a very fair and cool guy. 30% HW/70% Exams, but he gave extra credit and was super helpful in office hours. Exams were pretty difficult but graded generously. He did go over lecture time occasionally but he was otherwise an awesome professor. | Professor Gunby is amazing. He's super interested in math and very approachable and friendly at office hours, and is a great instructor on top of all of that. Math 300 was certainly a bit challenging but he gives you more than enough to do well. I don't think I would have ever found any interest in math if not for him. He probably changed my life. | I'll start with the flaw -- homework takes so much time and is so difficult! Unimaginable difficulty. His class was harder than the honors section! Now, the good things: His exams are reasonable, he is an EXCELLENT teacher, and he is friendly and personal with students. If you want a challenge, take his course, but be warned -- he is VERY HARD! | Let M = {math professors at Rutgers} and g = Benjamin Gunby. Theorem. g = max(M) Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists p in M such that p > g. This is a contradiction by the Gunby postulate. Therefore, g is an upper bound of M. Since g is an element of M, g = max(M). This concludes the proof. QED"
"Yazigi, Justin","Great teacher. He Likes to use big words. He is an easy grader and gives you alot of time to do a papers. | he's just a great guy | This guy is cool. I'm an engineer so I hate all forms of reading and writing. But this guy made class fun, was very humorous, gave us nicknames, really connected. We would discuss all the short stories and we would all analyze them together. As long as you attend class motivated and pay attention, it will be fun. | No Comments | Awesome teacher and guy, very fair for everyone tells you exactly what he wants, and its a shame he isn't teaching more classes here. | Typical English professor with a quirky sense of humor. Very caring towards his students although they should learn how to take a joke. He's able to elucidate the often obscure things we read in class. It doesn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes. Go to office hours. Overall an amazing guy who was engaging, thought provoking, and inspiring."
"Rechani, Phillip","This professor was very entertaining & a good guy- his stories were really fun- but I don't think he knew the material well enough to teach well. He was very high level and vague, & didn't know the formulas at all. I don't feel like I learned what I wanted to. Weekly HW (on content we didn't cover), midterm, group case, and final-> paper bc corona."
"Finley, Jacqueline","Genuinely cares about her students. Engaging classes and activities. Sometimes we'd go outside for mini lessons. Don't underestimate the workload of this class. It is a lot, do your best to not fall behind. But if you do, she is very very understanding. Great communication, always answers emails and is available to meet. | As a professor, she was great, very easy to talk to outside of class. However, she does go over class time as she loses track of time in her rants and since she doesn't allow electronics it is very hard to know when class is supposed to be over. There was only one paper but in the beginning of the course she does assign readings | Professor Loeb is probable the best professor at rutgers. First day im ngl I thought she was going to be strict but she ended up being a very caring person and taught me amazing life lessons. Definitely someone who sticks with you for life | Dr. Loeb is by far the best professor I have had at Rutgers. She cares so much about the success of her students. While she may be a little eccentric and make some unusual jokes and comments, she is such a wonderful teacher and has given me some of the most helpful feedback and tools I have received in my time at Rutgers. | I had her for the True Crime section and honestly, she was great. She doesn't allow phone/laptop use during class time unless she specifies, but that's minor. Not a tough grader at all and is always available if you need to discuss things further. Super funny (great if you love dark/rude humor), really helpful, and slightly chaotic but overall :) | She is my favorite professor of all time, in any class, at Rutgers. I know everyone in our class felt the same. I never had a professor who so genuinely wanted students to succeed, and cared about their well being outside of class. She challenges you (literally with ""life challenges""! ) She's one of those people you'll remember forever. | Professor Loeb is amazing, however, she does expect a lot from you. The research paper is long and very frustrating at times but Loeb makes sure she gives you as much help as possible to assure you get a good grade in her class. | Professor Loeb is the best professor I've had at Rutgers so far. For spring semester 2020, although the transition to online made things feel difficult and everything very uncertain, professor Loeb made sure to always offer her help with more office hours, hilarious lecture videos, and fun and engaging discussion posts for extra credit. Recommend!! | She's truly a gem at Rutgers, and probably the best professor I have had thus far. I had her for Research in the Disciplines and she was very caring, giving the best feedback and pushing for you to do better than the last. She also made class very entertaining with mini field trips and interesting facts about your topic. It's like she knows it all! | Professor Loeb, by far, is my most favorite professor. She's very motivating, and will push you to WORK for an A but in the end it's all worth it. She's one of the few gems of Rutgers who cares about her students beyond the classroom and will be there for you. Prepare to work hard but for a worthy cause. | Research in the disiplines is writing a LONG research paper, so that's hard. Prof loeb tells you everything you need to fix in each draft and really wants you to succeed. if you make the edits she tells you to, you'll get a good grade. I went from having red ink all over my rough draft to having 100 because i literally fixed everything she said to. | Shes one of my favorite professors! She keeps the class interesting and cares about her students. I wouldnt say her class is easy, but its not terribly difficult either. Very specific about what she wants. Just do the work, follow her instruction and youll be fine. She gives a lot of useful feedback, so take advantage of that! | I totally recommend Dr. Loeb's internship for tutoring research writers on Douglass if you can get in. I learned more about research writing attending her workshops than I did when I took Sci/Tech writing. She is funny but also damn serious at the same time. She really sticks up for her tutors and treats you like an equal. | Mixed feelings about Professor Loeb. On one hand she is kind, funny, and extremely knowledgeable! I enjoyed her class, but it is apparent that our 201 class was being held to dramatically higher standards than other classes. Understand that she wants you to do your best, but the amount of work is quite excessive. She's tough, and this is no easy A! | Professor Loeb is easily one of my favorite teachers I've had! The class is definitely more challenging than other Research in the Disciplines classes, but you will learn so much from her. She provides amazing feedback on your submitted work. But uh, someone who's reading this next year, please show her how to maximize windows on a Mac haha | Dr. Loeb is one of my favorite professors, she's so funny and kind. She's a tough grader, but it's because she wants you to do the best you can. She gives specific and helpful feedback and is very willing to sit down with you and work with you to help you get the best grade possible. you have to work hard, but it's almost impossible to fail. | Had the chance to be part of Jackie's internship for tutoring research writing students at the Douglass Writing Center. She was responsive, gave good feedback, and available for questions throughout the semester. She was very animated in our training sessions and I learned a lot about tutoring! | In the beginning she gives a lot of readings, which you shouldn't be too intimidated by. Put in effort in choosing a topic and in writing your source evals. This will help you in writing your first draft. Prof. Loeb helps you a long the way. She is SO nice, gives great comments, and is super funny. Not an easy A but with her help it can be. | The class is difficult and it seems like she made us do more work than other 201's. But I really learned a lot about my topic and research in general. She also gave great feedback on my drafts. Looking back it was definitely worth it, just be ready for a lot of work. Don't ignore her comments and don't be late for class! She locks the door. | I feel soooo lucky I had 201 with her. I wrote a paper that I'm actually proud of and never would imagine I could write. She expects a ton of revision though and will put you on the spot in class, but she's kind and funny. Wish she taught more classes. | She is great. Really fun. the class is a lot of work but she helps with every paper. Definitely go to conferences because she has a lot of instructions and suggestions. She knows something about everything and has ideas for every topic. | She is so great. She genuinely wants you to succeed, and she is super funny and real. Her comments on my paper were so helpful too! | I got a B+ on my 1st paper, although I had made the corrections she asked for on the 1st draft. So I worked harder and went to her for help. Definitely go to office hours because she offers great advice and likes you better. The class is tough and she's sometimes too sarcastic, but she is helpful and funny. Don't be late to class! | Dr. Loeb definitely goes out of her way to help students and wants to see them do well. She's patient with a lot of questions and you won't be afraid to ask. She is funny and enthusiastic but also gets that the class is hard so she's encouraging. Agree she is demanding and always pushing for better work but that's just her way. Fun class. | Professor Loeb is an amazing writing teacher. My work improved a lot. Had her for Expos after failing it once. She keeps the class interesting and fun. Grades were fair and consistent but she can be VERY demanding and picky too. Definitely not easy but I loved the class and miss having her | Jackie is a great teacher. She keeps class interesting by using real world examples and her wardrobe. As long as you stay on top of your work and improve your writing skills throughout the course, you'll get an A. | Had her for women's leadership, required by Douglass. She is really nice and fun. but I did not enjoy the class itself. Required to do every reading and they are time consuming, other prof don't require it. Does pop quizzes. Grades fairly."
"Cheong, Sang-Wook","Probably one of the worst physics professors or professors I have had. This was for physics 228 but unsurprisingly, there's no option to rate that class. A 55 minute class, with homework that takes over 3 hours, and recitation worth 30% of your grade and a final worth 40% of your grade. It's clear this professor does not care about teaching. | Every lecture was just going through slides, and his explanations would make a simple content seem more complicated than it really was. I learned more from the TA's explanations than this professor's. | Physics 124 is a really challenging class. Much harder than 123. Prof Cheong doesn't speak english very well but he really knows the material. The mini labs on lectures demonstrates the topics well. | The demonstration and labs are good, but the class is so unorganized and overly mathematic for its application. I love when teachers show math for a purpose. This is not one of those classes. A huge disappointment from my perspective; he hasn't taught me one new thing this entire semester. typical RU undergraduate stuff | Sang-Wook was a good professor, and his workshops were fun. I enjoyed explaining problems in class, for it helped me to better comprehend the material. Though he didn't speak English well, he really knew his stuff."
"McQuinn, Kristen","Very fun class, midterm and final was MCQ. Grade is mostly based on weekly HWs. | Amazing professor- clear lectures and does not get lost in the math- read the textbook and attend lectures- homework and tests are majority context based with bits of math application- easy to contact outside of lecture- amazing | She's a really good lecturer who actually wants her students to succeed. It is clear that she is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. She's also very active in research so if you do well in class that could open doors for you. Overall, 342 was much harder than 341 but still manageable if you put in the work. | Hands down, professor Mcquinn is one of if not the the best professor I've had at Rutgers. For a stem professor, she explains stuff incredibly well in lecture, and the few times I had to go to office hours she explained stuff even more clearly. Also was very supportive when I was experiencing mental health struggles and was flexible with deadlines. | Professor Mcquinn is a really good professor. She knows the material really well. She is really helpful and wants you to do well in the class."
"Prince, Heather","Pierce is definitely passionate about teaching. She tries to make the class feel more engaging, and it shows. Even though the lecture can be all over the place sometimes, she definitely made my 3-hour lecture entertaining. Overall, she's understanding and seems to really care about her students, which is rare at a big school. Would recommend! | Professor HP is incredibly funny and knowledgeable. I felt very engaged during the lecture and she gave us many opportunities to get to know others during class. Midterm and final exams were straightforward (She gives a study guide about what to expect in advance). There are also 3 easy papers. Very engaging course taught by a fantastic professor! | HP is a great educator and can be very engaging and funny. However, her teaching style might not appeal to everyone, as she is very passionate and frank in class. When I took her class, she seemed very distracted/overworked by her other obligations outside of teaching (there are many). If you can deal with an unorganized class, expect a good time! | Professor H.P is amazing! She has a different way of teaching that might not be familiar with everyone, but she truly care for her students. Using a program like ‘STATA' could be difficult, but Professor H.P is extremely understanding. She wants to see you succeed as well. Hand in the work and you'll be successful. Dont listen to the hate comments. | Really enjoyed this course! HP cares about the students and genuinely wants us to learn. She gives extensions and is very understanding. However, she can be disorganized in that grades were released late into the semester and she would cancel class last minute or arrive late. There was 1 exam, and some assignments. Overall, liked the class though! | Anyone who dislikes her though is probably very type A and has no desire for fun in their coursework. She is a strong female presence so sure that can occasionally come of as rude but she is anything but that. Super understanding about extensions and told us on the first day of class she would rather us submit our best work than on time. Love her. | in a word? wasted potential. the whole premise of mock parliament as a learning tool is great, and when executed well it was fun. but we had no grades until the day before the final, the professor showed up on time twice the entire semester (and was late to the final), and lectures were scatterbrained and often saw her go on random tangents. | so completely unprofessional. openly trashed the rutgers president and admin to students. rude and condescending to students, talked down to students when they were slightly over a deadline but yet she didn't meet ANY grading deadlines and took until the last day of the semester to release a single grade. this class made me regret majoring polisci | The Professor was often unprepared and late, did not update the syllabus, takes long to grade, does not respond to emails, and condescending at times. The class felt like high school (not in a good way), there are pop quizzes and she did not start teaching until 20-30mins after the class began. I would not recommend taking this class. | I don't recommend you take this class. Prof is disorganized and often goes off on tangents. Learned nothing. Exams are ridiculous, very hard (must remember many terms and write almost ten sentences about each). Three papers, four discussion posts weekly. Boring as anything. Does not respond to emails. Acts as if teaching is a burden. Huge class. | not one single grade has been posted all semester. assignments from first week of september still ungraded. class felt disorganized and all over the place | HP is the best poli sci professor. She cares for her students and will do her best to make sure you succeed. You definitely have to put in the work because Pol Sci Methods is not easy. She is always willing to help. HP is very unpredictable and will keep you entertained. I loved her class and met some great people. She is in fact a queen. | Professor HP is one of the heart and soul of the program. She motivates you to grow, and you will learn a lot. What I sincerely appreciate as a student is that she provides different mediums of learning, including documentaries, videos, books, articles, and especially group discussions. You will be considered lucky to take a class with her. | HP is amazing person who truly cares about her students. I have taken her twice now and would love to take more of her classes. Her exams are pure memorization and heavy discussion posts will be given every week. She is so lenient with extensions and will answer anytime you ever have a question. She truly wants her students to succeed. | Very disorganized but she was cool and very opinionated but love that for her | Amazing personality, u will self-teach all of the chapters but uses a great workbook, hw is hard, extremely understanding (will give insane extensions) very eccentric, and open about her personal life. I really liked her, but if you aren't willing to put in the effort of teaching yourself, you'll fail. I failed the first time, but now I'm passing. | One of my favorite professors of all time! Make sure to participate in class but even if you are falling behind in that she does let you know throughout the semester. One of the few professors that do actually care about her students and makes sure to help everyone through a topic. A lot of reading but always interesting! | Was very disorganized. Often changed assignments last minute and was hard to follow. Feel like I did a lot of self-teaching during the class. | I genuinely love going to her class. She actually cares about her students learning stuff more and less about the grade. If you go to class and do her assignments (they all lead to the final paper) you won't have to do much else. Very lenient about late work, super understanding just talk to her and she will work with you. 13/10 recommend! | Dr. HP is the best political science professor at Rutgers. She cares so much about her students and works hard to build their confidence while challenging them to think and learn new things. Her lectures are amazing and entertaining. It wasn't easy, but I learned more in this class than any other class I've taken in college. | Prof Pierce is great. She was really accommodating during this time and was willing to help as much as she could. Comparative Public Pol was made up of regular discussion posts, 3 policy memos, a midterm, and a final. She tried her best to keep class interesting and I really appreciated that since online classes can be boring. | I don't think I appreciated Professor Pierce enough while I was taking her class, but looking back she was a really good + nice professor. I would recommend waiting to take her class in person because there were definitely some elements of her class (mock parliament) that i don't think will have the same effect online. Exams require memorization."
