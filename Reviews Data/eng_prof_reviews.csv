"Olabisi, Ronke","Generally inconsiderate and sometimes rude towards me and fellow classmates. Was warned about this from other students who had classes with her too in the past, but she was the only one teaching the class at the time. No choice for us there. Choose wisely if you can. | I realized that Biomedical Engineering is a biology major rather than an engineering major while taking her course. | It was one of her first courses at UCI; the formatting of the course was off because it was made for in person (the class being online also contributed negatively to this). But the professor is really nice and is trying her best in these odd times. One negative is that she does not seem to accommodate for COVID-related problems during these times."
"Hacihaliloglu, Ilker","Excellent professor. Very understandable and straight-forward, and very willing to help with anything class-related or curiosity-related. In my experience (masters student), one of the best BME professors at Rutgers. | Prof Hacihaliloglu was great when I had him for Intro to Biomedical Engineering. The lectures were interesting, well organized, and concise. Tested on the main ideas, and he tells you what you should be taking home from the lectures. Def would take again."
"Shoane, George","Don't even bother taking this class, take it over the summer if you want to pass. | He should be ashamed of teaching this class. I really think that he doesn't speak English. It makes me so mad not caring about all his students failing. He is killing our hopes of becoming biomedical engineering, and the department won't do anything about it. He never responds to emails, and he doesn't care about any excuses. | Never cried about a class up until his. I questioned if BME is really the path I want. The exams are impossible to solve, and there are so many people who ruin the curves simply by cheating. The amount of tears I have shed in this class is insane. I even started questioning my existence. Avoid at all costs!!!!! | Shoane does not know how to teach this class. He gives us useless lectures but makes attendance required. To even have a chance of passing this class, you have to read the textbook word for word, it's crazy. For the curve, it's not based on class avg, but on the final avg. If you were on track for a B, but get the avg for the final, you get a C. | Worst professor I've had the test are lowkey impossible. If you can take it in the summer with a different professor. There is no point of showing up because you can' t even hear him anyways. And the homework takes actual years to complete. | AVOID AT ALL COSTS. With the most boring lectures you've ever seen combined with required attendance, taking a course with Shoane feels like cruel and unusual punishment. 80% of your grade is determined by the midterm and final. Do anything you can to avoid this professor, and if you're unlucky enough to end up with him, I wish you luck. | Worst class I have ever taken... the professor rambles on and repeats information but will barely cover the important information. He definitely has 10 year and teaches one class a semester. RUN from this professor, take it over the summer! The only way to learn in this class is to memorize the entire textbook. The averages are 30% with a curve. | Horrible, stay clear of this professor | absolute nightmare of a class | Do yourself a favor and take it in the summer with a different professor if you want to pass. | Do Not Take this class with Professor shoan, unless you are ready to memorize a textbook. | Horrible, avoid at all cost try taking it in the summer without Prof Shoan. His canavas class page is a mess, the lectures are terrible. The only way to do good in this class is by reading the textbook and straight out memorizing it. Pray you don't have genius classmates in your section who will ruin the curve. This class will make you cry | Professor Shoane's lectures were extremely boring and too fast-paced to retain information. The exams and quizzes required straight-up memorization of the course material and there was a LOT of material. The homework site was extremely expensive and the homework itself did not help me learn. Prof Shoane is not open to student feedback whatsoever. | His ""textbook"" is a compiled list of his unintelligible notes, which he makes you buy. No real reading material is given. Nice guy, but unless you have a direct link to his brain you won't understand anything he presents in class. If you're a grad student, try your best to not take his classes. | His lectures are not helpful at all, he only uploads selected slides on sakai. Attendance is mandatory. His 2 exams are ab 40% of the grade EACH so its only chance of getting a good grade in the class. Both in class and during remote instruction he doesnt care ab students learning, only cares ab making the exams/quiz cheat proof. limited resources. | Such a hard class simply because lectures are so hard to go through without flat lining. Homework is mediocre and inclass quiz is useless. His exams are extremely hard and curve is steep based on the class performance, hope someone dont ace anything like what happened in my class. Read text before, during and after class! Its tht hard n i tutor a&p | This class was awesome with Prof Shoane. The lectures were thought provoking, and I retained a lot of what I learned. He's kinda monotone, which can put you to sleep if you're not interested in the type of material being taught. I enjoyed his class, I'd take it again if it didnt cost so much money. | He reviews no new info, just material taken from the textbook so lectures are boring. Do go to lecture though for attendance points and quizzes! Quizzes aren't really quizzes, just review questions gone over as a whole class. Exams are tough, must read the textbook thoroughly. This semester, an A on exams is a score of 75-100. | Professors like this should get fired. No reason the average on exams are 35% consistently. That's not teaching if the majority of your class passes due to a curve. That means you're doing something wrong as a professor. I get it if you want to make a few problems hard to challenge students to think critically, but Shoane is ridiculous. | That class was rough. I wouldn't recommend his class but he is the only person that teaches EEE at the moment so you have to grit and bear it... Attendance is mandatory and he hates cellphones. Only advice is to make a friend to study and do the homework with... | The professor is really nice but he tends to challenge the students in a clever way that way you learn on your own. You will fail the class if u are dumb and not up to the challenge, but you will learn a lot if you do accept it. Tests are hard and the hw sol aren't available so the class is a hard one... only advised to A students | Probably the worst professor I've ever had. He is boring, confusing, unfair, and unreasonable. His voice is quite monotonous and he teaches things in roundabout ways that will confuse even students who understand the material. The exams are hard and the grading is harder. Electrical engineering isn't his field area and it shows. | Terrible. Worst teacher I've ever had. He doesn't care about the students. | Attendance is mandatory. He never use textbook. He has his own world. | So Boring. Extremely Hard Exams. Really big curves. | One of the worst teachers that I've encountered at Rutgers Engineering. Shoane has us use a completely different textbook than the one used for homework and exams, making studying nearly impossible. Lectures are not sufficient to pass the class. Avoid this professor at all costs. | you really dont want to take a class with him. every one complaining about his teaching even the person who got the highest score. He speak english with good accent but in chinese grammer. you cant understand him and he is so lost !!! | Worst lecturer ever. Prints the book out word for word and shows it on a powerpoint, speaks in monotone, and attendance was part of the final grade. Extremely unwilling to go over grade break down at the end of the semester after unfair grading. | The exams are exactly the same as the previous year. He changed it this semester though so next semester might not be as easy. Great curve-- 75 for an A, 58 for B | DO NOT TAKE IT UNTIL AFTER CALC 4 (preferably alongside calc 5)!! If you do this, eee is a joke and SUCH an easy A. If you take it WITH calc4, you WILL NOT get higher than a C+ There's a second-order ODE on the midterm and an inverse Laplace on the final. Other than that, he's super nice but takes attendance and grades hw harsh, lab is easy | No Comments | Lectures are terrible. Just puts of transparencies of the book and reads through it. No cheat sheets on exams, too much to memorize. The only good thing about this class was the curve, since everyone did so bad. You should avoid this guy if there is any possible way you can. | Drop this class while you still can."
"Parekkadan, Biju","He has issues with timing and often goes overtime and tries to make the material interesting. It was hard to understand the material and he isn't the best lecturer, but the curve was generous. | One of the worst professors. Doesn't explain the material well enough to understand, yet tests you using extremely hard technical questions which are completely unlike any examples in class. caught a few students cheating and instead of punishing them, punishes the whole class by changing the final 2 DAYS b4 we took it. Rude to students afterwards | Very patient, always listens to feedback, one of the best professors in the BME department in my opinion. Class is very hard but don't let it discourage you, everything clicks once you put in the work. He wants everyone to get an A and it really shows in his work. | Professor Parekkadan wants all the students to learn yet expects everyone to be as smart as he is and just get it when most of this material has never come across many of the students before. He also makes Quizzes 30% of your grade which is the same as tests ( also 30% of your grades ). Quizzes are extremely difficult and you'll score poorly on it. | He gave open textbook exams and quizzes. Very lenient. Ready to adapt. He wants everyone to get an A and it shows in his work | Placed the entire worth of his class on TopHat. Class participation and attendance through TopHat matter A LOT! His exams are pretty difficult, so much so that he had to drop the first exam grades from counting towards our final grade in the course since the averages were so low. A very smart guy but lectures are dry and he's not a great professor."
"Labazzo, Kristen","Easily one of the best professors at Rutgers. Explains everything and really cares about her students ! | She's a great professor! The exams are fair and she grades very leniently. You also learn a great deal in the class. Her ""mom jokes"" are great. She provides the slides which are very detailed and helpful. 100% the best professor in the BME department at Rutgers. | God bless. She is incredible. She is a fair grader and gives so many opportunities to succeed in the classroom. There are iclicker attendance and some questions per each lecture, but if you pay attention, you should be more than fine. She does have a lot of reading for each lecture, but if you study it, you will be fine for the exam. Shes the best! | She's the nicest lady in the department. I didn't want to take the class because I wasn't really interested in the bio-materials track. Did okay on 1st exam, bombed the second one. I went to talk to her in person and thought she'd ask me to drop the class, but SHE DIDN'T. She was really helpful and told me what I should do to pass! 100% Recommend! | The class itself can be boring, but Dr. Labazzo makes an effort to make the material interesting. She shares her research, brings in guest speakers, and brings in examples of biomaterials. She is funny, helpful, responds quickly to emails. Her exams are straightforward and come directly from the slides."
"Pierce, Mark","Clear, concise material and grading systems. Office Hours are very helpful for completing/understanding the homework. Exams are extremely fair and cover exactly what we were taught. Final Project is very straightforward, easily one of my favorite BME classes so far at Rutgers. | Everythings been said already, but does not grade tests fairly as there is low to none feedback on them. Hard homeworks and does not try to give any help towards the end of the course for those who may really need it. | Graded on 4 homeworks (35%), mid-term and final exams (20% each, open notes), project (20%), attendance (5%). Cut-offs (A,B+,B,C+,C,D) at 84%, 78%, 71%, 65%, 60%, 45%. Class mean 73.9%. Exam/homework solutions posted, past practice exams posted, lecture slides posted. Easy to do well if you take it seriously, easy to do badly if you don't. | Few tests and confusing long lectures. Does not give back much feedback on tests and seems to grade them based on whether you show up to class or not, not if you actually did well on the exams. | Professor Pierce will educate you well on the topic he's teaching. He knows his material thoroughly, but he paces his way through the lecture material so you can understand it. He's a tough but fair grader, you'll have to earn every point. If you listen in class and take notes you'll do fine. His accent is the verbal equivalent of smooth jazz | Great professor, reiterates in the lectures what's important for exams which makes them easy to prepare for. You are required to think analytically and not just regurgitate information mindlessly which some people below may have expected. There are few homework assignments that are of similar format to the exams so you know what to expect. | Does not care about the students as the tests have no type of feedback on them. Only 2 tests and a project determine your grade, if u cant make a few classes youre basically down to a C already. Very hard to talk to and no type of extra credit no matter what the situation is. | Makes it hard to do well cause theres too much emphasis on exams while there is only 2 exams. If he knows your name it can be good but more likely to be bad because he will not give any help or lehway in your final grade. As a senior try to avoid global health because it could potentially ruin your chances of getting a job after the grading. | Is generally very clear and speaks in a way that is engaging. Homework assignments are easy. Tests require little additional preparation other than attending lecture or a brief review of the material. Nice guy always willing to answer questions or correct mistakes. | Cares for his students. Tests are long but exactly what should be expected based on practice exams. Helpful in office hours. Really cool guy overall!"
"Berthiaume, Francois","With the transition to online classes, he has been working very hard to make everything very organized and if he makes a mistake he is not afraid to give back points. He is a decent lecturer and provides quizzes with each online lecture to make sure you are on track. Class average is curved to a B which is fair considering the exam averages are low | The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class. | A rough prof to take, wouldn't want to take class with him again, cynical. | Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor. | The course in general is pretty bad. Berthiaume doesn't seem to care much and doesn't explain things particularly well. The exams were difficult. | very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board. Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity. If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam. | He goes over the material in lecture pretty well. His test was pretty much from the lecture, but the last question was worth 40 points and combined almost all the concepts he taught. He's kinda boring, but pay attention and make sure you know the homework. That should at least get you a 70 on the test. Intro to BME is curved so much it's funny."
"Shreiber, David","Very engaging lecturer and a very fair grader. No one assignment or test is very punishing, so you have a lot of opportunities to improve your grade. The term project is a really good experience, as well as replacing a Final Exam. Pay attention in lectures and you should do well. | Really good, cares about his students. Homework is really hard, and when it's assigned is often a lot harder than the lecture, but it's not weighted heavily and you end up learning a lot. | Prof Shreiber was great, the class format for Tissue Eng II was unusual but he made it work. He's really passionate about BME, and wants to prepare you for the outside world. He's funny, engaging, but serious about making sure you know your stuff. He's flexible with how things are done in class too. | easily the BEST professor I've had at Rutgers so far. you'll definitely get a lot more out of the class than just biomechanics w/ shreiber. definitely go out of your way to have him. no regrets, hope he always stays the same | Amazing professor!! one of the best to teach in engineering.. very prepared.. knows his material on the back of his head.. no curve.. but notices ppl who deserves an A. extremely helpful. makes sure every student putting effort understands material... best prof ever!!! | The material is easy, but it is very boring. Exams can be tricky at times, but overall they are pretty easy. He doesn't give a big curve and does not care if that means only giving out a few A's. He is a tricky guy... makes mistakes in his lecture notes on purpose to catch people who don't go to class. The project can save your grade though. | A bit of a descriminaTOR... and i'm not talking grades | gives too much work and is cheap with grades | decent professor....easy material....project need a bit of work....hard to get an A | No Comments"
"Drzewiecki, Gary","Advanced devices lab must be the easiest departmental elective for BME. Dr. D is awesome, very lenient, and will let you submit lab reports near the end of the semester if need be. Quizzes are very easy, and lab reports, while individual, are only due every other week, giving you lots of time to work on them. Would HIGHLY recommend taking 470! | Nice guy. Horrible professor. I'm sure he's good at research, so maybe he should stick to that. I've had him for Devices and in the past, Systems Phys. Both times, I learned nothing, and in fact knew less coming out of lecture than I did going into it. | Dr.D's class was really hard to follow, I'd say read the textbook instead but you'll have an even harder time there. He's a really nice, and polite guy, and willing to help you if you're struggling, but his teaching methods are lacking. Going through the lectures on your own may yield more. If he was more engaging and better paced he'd be fantastic | System physiology with Dr. D is not too hard, but you won't learn much. He's a nice guy but he really just can't teach. His homework assignments are pretty easy, but the multiple choice exams can be tricky. Overall not a terrible class; just read the book and you'll be fine. | Very nice man, but should not be teaching any more. Provides incorrect material to the class and then puts it on the tests. Only way to survive is to read the book and teach yourself because he won't teach you anything without confusing you more | REALLY nice guy. Teaching abilities are so-so but he's really helpful! Tests are easy and he really knows what he's talking about. Extremely helpful in lab as well! | Nice man. Scans pages of the book and puts on screen in front of classroom and reads from them. Had to basically teach myself from the book. No point in going to class unless attendence is taken."
"Sy, Jay","He's basically too demanding for a 1 credit course. There's a lot of work to be done each week and he grades harshly. In the other engineering disciplines, SD lecture is a ""show up and get an A class"", but here it is far from. Both small and large groups have the same expectations, so if you happen to be in a small group you will need to do more. | Professor Sy is really smart, and his lectures are quality. You'll learn a lot in his class about the engineering thought process, steps to take to start and complete a project, and considerations along the way. That said, he gives SO. MUCH. WORK. I worked harder in his 1 credit class than I have in 4 credit classes, it was inordinate, honestly."
"Li, John","No homework and only grades off of 5 quizzes(lowest dropped) and 2 exams and a final. Gives extra points on all quizzes and exams. | I took professor Italia's principles of micro and attendance isn't mandatory but if you miss important information it's very easy to fall behind he gives out many quizzes and exams they aren't difficult if you study a good amount his lectures are very straightforward and you can tell he knows what he's talking about and cares about his students. | I took Principles of micro and it is an easy class if you put in the time attendance is not mandatory but you will not succeed | Very good professor, made micro easy for me personally, but is a concept heavy class. Paying attention during lectures is crucial, I found the textbook difficult to understand. As questions to make sure you understand topics as you learn them. Missing one thing may set you back. He teaches well, just a matter of how much work you put in. | Very good professor, made microeconomics very interesting and easy to digest. No homework besides studying for quizzes and exams. The lectures and the reviews typically reflect the exams, and he has textbook pages to refer to as well. | Fantastic! | It would be wrong not to take him | It's super easy, I recommend to take this class | my favorite professor by far | Best professor at rutgers. | hes a great proffesor, the best on I have had at Rutgers, Would take a class form him again | Nice guy | he's amazing! really cares about your grade and does everything he possibly can to make sure you pass. i wish i took the class a little more seriously however. his lectures are informative and important, but you will need to study for this class. quizzes and tests are fine as long as u study and understand the material. take him!!! | Such a nice professor. Graded on two exams as well as a few (relatively easy) homework. He is easy to reach outside of class. He adds extra credit questions to exams. He is so funny!! This class was online and easy to manage while taking 6 other classes (LOL). Definitely recommend! | He is very caring and really wants students to succeed. Gives you as much time as you need on exams/quizzes. His lectures are super helpful and if you attend, the quizzes and exams will be easy. Gives opportunities for quiz retakes when the class does bad. Always responds to emails quickly. | I loved taking micro with this professor he really simplifies concepts. Attendance is not mandatory but I would not recommend skipping. Grades are only based on 5-6 quizzes, 2 midterms, a final. he always holds review sessions before midterms/final. Also if you struggle with time on quizzes and exams he lets you take as much time as you need to. | Although he was a busy person outside of teaching, he always stayed after and helped anyone who needed it. His teaching was fast paced but always repeats himself. He is direct, open minded and personable. Never thought I would love learning about microeconomics, but it was one of my favorite classes. Best professor I have ever had. | John is literally my favorite professor at Rutgers! I love this man, he is such a chill and easy-going person, and his lectures are amazing and he doesn't use powerpoints at all, which allows me to focus more on the lectures and take notes on my own. He's very caring and answers all your questions. I'm taking his other course next semester so yeah. | The lectures were really great. He was always willing to hold review sessions for exams and wanted students to ask questions if they need. The topic was challenging but the textbook and professor really helped. | Professor Italia is so helpful and such a nice man. He literally helped me with anything that I would ask, even if it was personal. If you need help, he will call you and talk you through your work or even help you come to conclusions. Great man. | Professor Italia is possibly the nicest professor I've had at Rutgers. I took him for management and the class was designed to be fairly easy. As long as you watch the lectures (which are about 30 minutes) and take notes, you can legitimately get an 100 in the class. Also makes himself accessible outside of class to discuss literally anything. | This Professor is the greatest Econ Prof at Rutgers for Non-Econ majors! He curved every single quiz and exam. He did a before and after review for every quiz and exam. Our class didn't fare so well on a quiz so he gave the whole class the chance to do a make up to replace that quiz. He really wants you to learn! | John is a really caring prof and will help you out whenever you need, he offered to stay after class and discuss the information as long as you would like after every class. Lectures are really thorough and easy to understand, you dont need to get the book if you pay attention in class and write down the things that are clearly important. | Professor Italia is the gold standard of teaching at Rutgers . They could literally pay this guy to show other professors how to show concern for students. Email response time is incredible. Very patient and doesnt give up until u understand if you seek out his help. But the course still requires you to study . | I love him! AMAZING teacher & person. The difference between him and other teachers is that he actually wants you to like and understand economics, not be turned off by it. He will do anything to make you feel comfortable and confident in the material he's teaching. If you have the opportunity to take a class with him, do it. He was born to teach. | Prof Italia is an amazing lecturer who truly cares about his students. He always explains concepts really thoroughly and makes sure you understand it. Every class he offers to stay extra hours to help anyone who has questions about the material. Truly great professor and a great person all together. | John's microecon was one of the best classes I've had at Rutgers. Great instructor / you can tell he does this because he wants to be there. Very smart guy but also there to support you in ways that other instructors couldn't be bothered with. Really appreciate his coming late on nights before exams to help students study. great guy. | Literally one of the nicest people I have ever met. Genuinely cares about his students and tries to explain things many times and as clear as possible. Always throws extra points and curves a lot, and has reviews. Class was much harder than expected and he is the only reason I passed. Does not take attendance but book is useless, so go to class. | He is the best professor I have met at Rutgers!!! His lecture is very easy to understand!!! I like to take his class and he is so nice that he will stay as late as you want!!! A great professor. And the micro is very easy to get an A. Just learn what he teach you. That is enough. | One of the best professors at Rutgers. He's very nice and is very understanding of his students. Always willing to help by answering questions and holding review sessions, usually curves the exam grades. Quizzes and midterm/final exams are easy, but you have to study. All you have to do to pass this class is literally show up and take decent notes. | He is honestly one of the best professors in Rutgers. I wish he taught more classes so I could take him again. Got me into economics and now I plan on being an Econ major. You are not required but should show up for class and take notes. As long as you pay attention, this is an easy A. | This guy will be the best professor you will ever have at rutgers. Most professors nowadays treat college kids like second class citizens, especially if you are a freshman. John Italia manages to make you feel cared for even in a room of 100 kids. An easy A if you go to class. I never had to open the textbook. He goes over everything b4 the test. | You need to study minimally for this class. Goto class, take notes, and you will do fine. I did great in the beginning, started slacking off in the middle of the semester, and then got back up in the end, and I ended with an A! He curves the final good! He is the sweetest econ professor! He wants you to learn! And he offers help all the time! | By far the BEST and most fair professor at Rutgers. He is a class act. He will teach you until you understand everything and will even come in on days in which he doesn't have class or office hours just to help you. | 373:121. AMAZING CLASS. best professor at rutgers hands down. cares about you and your grade and genuinely wants everyone to do well. he drops your lowest quiz and will even drop your 2 lowest quizzes for taking optional quiz. exams are not easy but he does a good job preparing you. MUST TAKE HIM for micro classes | He is the man, best teacher by far i've had here at Rutgers. He is clear respected and an awesome guy. This isn't his main job, he teaches because he likes to and it shows. | I was not sure if I wanted to minor in Economics so I just took this class. It is a bit hard, you have to put in the time and pay attention to the lectures but the professor is really reliable. He is always there if you need help. | Italia is like the nicest econ professor! If you have to take a microecon class, besides Intro to Microecon, take it with this guy! The only fault about him is ""skip class? You won't pass."" He doesn't provide any notes. He only lectures for like an hour and expects you to get all the info down on paper. You can get A, but you need to work for it. | He definately cares about students actually understanding the material and is very accessible via phone email on evening and weekends. Works very hard to make a somewhat complex topic simplified and accessible. Very straigtforwrd no tricks. All around awesome instructor, reccomended to anyone who needs Micro. | I had this professor for Microeconomics Fall 2014. He is a nice professor, but his lectures are confusing, well for me they were. He didn't use powerpoints, so he just talks, so you miss a lot of material if you don't pay close attention. You may need to ask for additional help when learning the graphs. | This professor is the MAN. I was unsure about my major (I knew I wanted something towards economics) but his microeconomics class got me hooked. He is so clear, he is always open to questions, and he is always there for the students, which in my opinion is the most important part. HIGHLY recommend. | Italia was an awesome professor, really sweet guy and always tried his best to help students fairly. Definitely go to lecture, you also don't need the textbook for his class. He goes kinda fast in lecture, but other than that he really knows his material and really cares about his students! If you put in the work you can def. do well in his class! | This class had some hard concepts but he is wants to make sure that all of his students pass. He was one of my best professors and am honestly considering taking another one of his classes! Just go to lectures, take notes, and ask questions! | very good professor! microeconomics is a difficult subject but he literally makes way to see his students pass. curves exams and quizzes if a certain percentage of the class gets it wrong. basically, he's one of the best micro professors that Rutgers has to offer! TAKE Him. | Micro was an awesome experience - he works in industry and adds real world perspective made a big difference. Definately cared about students and getting people to actually learn. Good examples and eager to help. Late night exam review sessions and answered email pretty much 24/7. Probably best Rutgers class I've had. | I took management with Italia and it was great! He's a manager himself, so he was able to provide real world examples and advice. Tests were ok just know your stuff. And buy the textbook!! He basically reads the textbook in class so its helpful to highlight whatever he reads and to look back when studying for exams | Best teacher for a class that basically everyone has to take. Do not buy the book but go to class and take notes on the lecture. Those notes are what show up on quizzes/exams. He is very open to questions too and wants us to do well. He will not test you on anything he doesn't discuss in class GREAT TEACHER | He is by far the BEST teacher I've had in my entire life. Economics was a weakness of mine in HS and I was worried going into this class, but with his amazing explanations and dedication to helping his students, I aced the class with no problem, and I REALLY understood the concepts, not just memorization. 100% recommend to anyone and everyone. | Italia was extremely dedicated and helpful. Liked this class much more than I expected - real world application kept it interesting. One of the best instructors I've had at Rutgers so far. | Just go to class and take notes and you are guaranteed to do very well. He wants everyone in the class to do well. Quizzes and exams are fair, EVERYTHING comes from his notes. Whatever you do, just dont take micro with Vallegany."
"Craelius, William","Professor William Bottega is a strict but highly professional instructor. He sets high standards and expects his students to meet them, which motivates you to push your limits and truly understand the material. His ability to convey complex concepts clearly and his dedication to students' success make his classes invaluable for serious learners. | The entire class consisted of 4 quizzes, homework, a midterm and final, usually the quizzes arent too bad if you understood the homework. I would recommend doing the example problems in the textbook, helped a ton. No calculators, he gives his own cheat sheet, the class was semi difficult but manageable, he curved quite a bit at the end. | this is the most terrible course I had during my four years at Rutgers. His lectures do not make any sense. The exam regulations are highly rigid, with no allowance for calculators or cheat sheets. He expects you to devote an excessive amount of time to this course, as if it were the only class you are currently taking. Avoid him at all cost. | Failed this class and retook it. Very difficult class. Probably the hardest class off of course material I have taken in my 4 yrs. However, exams are fairly graded, and there is a homework solutions doc which can be useful for double checking answers. Advice: go to class, take notes, study. It's supposed to be hard. Good luck. | His Aerospace Structures class was straight up a bad time. He just lectures at you for the duration of the class doing intense derivations and I don't thing a single student follows. Then the tests worth the majority of your grade don't reflect the homework one bit so you don't really have anything to study off of. Would recommend staying clear of! | They say a professor can make or break a subject, and professor Bottega broke, stepped on and destroyed Dynamics. He didn't teach, he copied down his notes on the board and read them out loud. Overall he is a complicated, messy and difficult professor with handwriting that even Morse code professionals will have a hard time deciphering. | Got above average in class and received a ""failing"" grade . He will cover 9+ boards of notes that are almost strictly equations and come time for the exam he will be mad that the class only knows how to plug and chug. Also takes off points for correct answers if you could have observed the answer but did work instead. | Professor Bottega is a nice guy. He normally teaches graduate classes, so teaching Dynamics was a change of pace for him. He spends most of the class time going over proofs and a couple of examples, so you need to be prepared to learn some other things on your own. Easy exams/quizzes, but homework is extremely difficult and long. Ask questions! | Very mean and unfair grader. Does not help anyone. No one ever goes to his office hours. | If you are a super nerd you will enjoy his class, for an average student like me, I was lucky I got a B. His exams are difficult to do even with an open book, enough said | Bottega is a good professor. The book he uses is the one he wrote, so he can always clarify on things. He's pretty easy to talk to, and pretty laid back. Quizzes and exams were tough for the most part, but fair. Whatever was on there, was what he said was going to be on there. No surprises. I'd take another of his classes if I could. Recommend. | This is the second, and last, class I'll have with Bottega. He's my favorite engineering professor. He's very academically demanding and is not afraid to give anyone a low grade for a poor performance. Honestly, Vibrations was my hardest course this semester, but also my favorite. Ask him questions, answer his question, show up to class, and STUDY. | First, I loved Bill Bottega. I know a lot of people weren't huge fans of him, but I enjoyed his class for the most part and ended up with a great grade. Upsides: You almost always know what he expects of you, or it's not very hard to figure out. Downside: there a lot of derivations you waste time with, that may never be used. Great guy and prof! | he was good. I have to say I really enjoyed that class. maybe he's hell in vibrations, but for fluids he's the man | Bottega is underrated. I was terrified of him, but he is so willing to help anyone that asks. He's very intelligent and expects a lot from students, so if you arent willing to do some work don't take him. I thought he was great | Condescending, pompous, and prone to mood swings. Tends to assume students are experts in things they learned years before and is only nice to students that have perfect grades and suck up. | avoid at all costs FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!!!!!! | I passed vibrations w/him and hardly ever went. The kids that failed are the same kids that slipped through the cracks and don't deserve an engineering degree. Take him, he will either show you A) what you are capable of, or B) that you have no business being an engineer. Either way, you will learn some important things about yourself. | callin this guy a **** is being far too generous and nice | He is a def a smart guy, at times little bit of an ****. If your intelligent you ll do okay. No one ever goes to his office hours, so show up once or twice and you ll understand the stuff a lot better then the rest of the class. Oh and he is a tough grader. | ARROGANT as can be. | ""This is the average, it is still an F"" - Need I say more?? | Unless you are an A+ student, STAND CLEAR!!! He has no qualms of failing an Senior. Extremely Arrogant. He is very smart, but maybe too smart. | This guy has ice flowing through his veins. He is nasty in class unless you are one of his favorites. Don't take him. Consider yourself warned. | Excellent teacher, tough subject, see him for extra help, Bottega will make it clear."
"Langrana, Noshir","If possible take the course with another prof. He is so passive and intimidating. Makes you feel dumb for asking questions. By far worst professor I have had. | He is a walking migraine | He can come off as strict or intimidating but he's really nice and a good teacher. Attend class and pay attention. He's a smart man. | Best of the best for MAE 434 | Not the best teacher, but he's really nice and if you need help with anything he'll help you out. Pay attention in class because he makes the problems he's putting on the exam pretty obvious. | Does'nt teach anything great. Just keeps you reminding that you are BME students and something is expected of you and I dont get it. thinks he is funny but is not. 'bread and the butter' and 'langrana's trap' is at the top of his discussion. | not the greatest | The best teacher i ever had......he's like a father to me."
"Cai, Li","Very confusing to understand, did not explain concepts well. Tbh, I feel bad for him lol because he is so sweet outside of class but does not explain the lectures well, making the class boring when Stem cells are so interesting. he called me out for being sick once oops and his lectures is mostly discussing research papers. | I left with a lot more questions than answers as he failed to explain concepts well. I feel bad for him because he is a really nice man, but is just not a good lecturer. Bores students really quickly and fails to generate interest in the topic. Tough on attendance and lectures consist of reading directly off cryptic research papers. | Really nice guy and answers questions perfectly. Had him for a Byrne Seminar and had to make two easy presentations. Classes are mandatory but it's easy. | Professor Cai is fantastic. Had him for Tissue Eng I, the class was formatted well, the lectures are concise, and hes pretty flexible with how things go. Really polite, nice, well meaning guy, and always positive. He cares deeply for his students, and really passionate about his field. Can be tough if you dont study so come prepared for the quizzes | Cool class | Aggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! | No Comments | New teacher. Course was poorly formatted before he got here. Wasted time with seminar. Lectures from a book we don't have. Quizes and exam from book we don't have! Bottom line: we are responsible for material not taught in class and not in our book. Quiz questions are very unclear. However, I do think he is giving a good deal of effort."
"Gormley, Adam",nice guy & very enthusiastic during lectures
"Zahn, Jeffrey","Plan to dedicate at least an entire day to do the week's homework. Attend office hours cause they are so helpful. If you pay attention in class and read his notes thoroughly you will do well on exams. I just want to say that this professor is the most helpful professor I have EVER dealt with. He wants to see you learn. He is on your side! | Zahn is a pretty good lecturer and is more than willing to help out students in class and office hours. Class isn't mandatory, but it is still beneficial to attend. Homework assignments can be tough at first, but once you learn the methods then you can apply them to any other similar questions. Exams tend to be representative of homework questions. | Flamboyant voice is very annoying along with the hand flares. I have never seen the wife and kids that he raves about (think what you will about that.) For the exams, he might as well have asked us to cure cancer. If I have to solve that man carrying a suitcase problem one more time,I'm going to lose it. If you fail, it has no reflection on you :) | Only attended a handful of lectures but still earned an A in the course. As long as you read his notes and understand the homeworks he gives, you'll do fine. Office hours are also useful because he goes over problems until you understand them. Very nice professor and and enthusiastic about what he teaches | Zahn is awesome as long as you attend lecture AND office hours I got an A in his class because I attended all lectures, read his notes, attended all office hours, did the hw and redid the hw and practice problems for exams trust me follow this you will get an A if not B+ he also lets you have a 1 page cheat sheet so no worries | Intro to Biomechanics is not that hard of a class if you do your part. Attendance is not mandatory but it is extremely helpful. Going to class and taking notes makes the class 95% easier than what you think. the other 5% is doing the hw and understanding it. office hours are really helpful use it for an A. if he knows that u r doing ur best it's A. | Intro to Biomech is NOT a hard class, if you're doing bad then you really must be slacking. You get cheat sheets for tests, and the questions are literally just like the hw. Understand the hw even if its only 5% of the grade. Go to class and take notes b/c you need them to do hw and need the hw to ace the tests. It's really that simple. | In 201, there is no partial credit. In 208, he looks through each problem and gives a good amount of partial credit. Go to office hours. He's very helpful and will answer any questions you have. Class can get boring, but do the HW and look at the review questions. Exams are difficult but showing you have an idea of what you're doing gives credit | Very bad prof. doesnt know how to teach. The avgs for his exams are in 40s. very bad. | Not a good professor. His grading proves extremely lazy and unjust. Strictly depends on the answer you receive - not the work you put in. An incorrect sign in the final answer will result in ZERO points for a TWENTY POINT question. Going to his office hours is pointless since he just tries to push you out. Very uninterested in teaching. | Good teacher.To do well, you must read all the notes he posts and do the homework.Study the homework for exams and put examples on the 1 page of notes he allows you to bring to exams.Really not bad at all. | Yeah hes good. Does problems on the board. Go to office hours and he'll teach you what you need to know for the exam | Exams are based on understanding on the material & are tough but gives alot of points as long as you show that you understand the concepts. Homework takes a VERY long time, however if you understand the homework before an exam, you shouldn't have a problem. ALWAYS willing to help students out. Much better 1-on-1 than in lecture. | Nice guy, an OK teacher. In lecture just reads off the power point slides. Grades more fair than the other comments on here. If you go to class, do and understand the homework you should have no problem. If need extra help, he has no problem to help you out even outside his office hours. | Teaching should be centered around the students and what is good for them. Dr. Zahn is a textbook example of a person who is more concerned trying to impress rather than teach. Questions asked are rebuffed, mistakes and errors are rampart, accompanied by ""I will work it out and someone remind me next session."" Genuinely horrible experience. | He is the worst guy i have ever seen. He doesnt know how to teach. Teaches with powerpoint without solving a single problem. if u ask him any question he gets upset. He doesnt know how to correct papers. Worst grader ever seen. No step by step grade. Would never take him again. | He is a nice guy but his tests are extremely hard. He always throws a curve ball on the exams. His homeworks take a very long time. | No Comments"
"Buettner, Helen","often unclear when giving instructions, not concise/inarticulate during lectures (stumbles over words), basically reads off of slides. LAs/TA often explained material better. luckily the course material was easy | Professor Buettner should not be the head of chemical engineering, mostly because of her social awkwardness. A conversation with Buettner seems incredibly forced as the woman clearly cares little about what you say and doesnt listen to her students whatsoever. The class is fair, but deserves a better professor FOR SURE. | Buettner isnt good at what she does. Cares little for her students, and has a ton of trouble to get her thoughts across. Relates INCREDIBLY POORLY to the students. Is the head of the department but doesnt do anything to actually help the students. Her exams are fair, but her lectures are so incredibly boring. Professor LACKS passion. | She is not a good lecturer but her powerpoint slides are very useful. Homework is insane but exams are much easier. Exams are kind of long but are not bad and fairly graded. Make sure to do all the old exams and the in class questions since these are very similar to the actual exams. Textbook was awful, go off of her slides instead. | Nice, sweet, and understanding as a person but not made for teaching. Cannot clearly get ideas across; unclear criteria for projects and papers; information not communicated well. | Do the homework. | Lecture was just her reading off slides with a bunch of hard clicker questions. Homework was long and rather difficult. Exams were fair and clearly graded. Overall not as hard as she makes it seem. | She just goes over lecture slides but she gives iclicker questions that are hard and that you've never seen before. There are LAs that go around and help with iclicker questions. The homework is harder than anything she goes over and harder than the exams. However, the practice exams are a good example of what the actual exam is going to be like. | She is a very sweet person, both in-class and out of class, but she is kind of awkward. Buettner is not the best professor ever, but this class is essentially a review of gen chem. All you need to know is the Law of Conservation of Mass and Energy. She makes the class very easy, and the averages are about 85. Attendance is mandatory to get an A. | Dr. Buettner is not a great professor per say but her lectures were very good because they were fun and although she only introduced the concepts of the material in class, the other assignments and exams were based heavily on understanding of these simple concepts. the concepts taught were very easy and this class was a pleasure to me. nice lady. | As a person she's very sweet BUT very inefficient as a professor. Made the class more difficult than it was because of being VERY unorganized She got confused during lectures, lots of her slides had SO MANY mistakes. TERRIBLE at reviewing hw problems during class because she confused herself. Her inefficiency made it VERY difficult for us to learn. | She's a very nice lady. Lectures can get boring as the material is not the most interesting, and she speaks very softly which can make it hard to hear her. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed. The class isn't very difficult, but the homework is insane. Nice professor overall. | great teacher. Go to her office hours and she will help you a lot. she really cares about her students and their progression in the class. if you make an effort to do better, she will meet you half way. | Her exams are exactly like the homework. Just study the content on her slides and read the assigned material and you will be fine. | She's very clear with what you need to know for the tests. She makes the tests very similar to the homework problems, so if you do the homework you'll be fine. She does expect attendance every lecture, and homework twice a week. Overall would highly recommend. | Very helpful professor. Moves very slowly in class and homework qns are much harder than her examples, so be prepared to ask your classmates for help or go to the txtbk (which is too wordy, imo). Understand the homework questions completely and keep up with the class, and it shouldn't be hard to do well on exams. She doesn't curve much. | Very nice. Lenient | She is horrible. stay away from her if you do not want to mess up your gpa. she doesn't care about her students.she mumbles all the times and expects you to understand. all the students were struggling with her. Half of her class failed or got Ds. | One of my least favorite classes I've taken at Rutgers. She goes over very basic questions in class and then gives incredibly difficult questions that are not covered in the book for homework. Need to go to office hours to figure anything out. | Good professor, homework is pretty difficult but there is a lot of help between the professor and TA. As long as you do the the homework and understand it the exams are not that difficult. She does a good job at explaining the basic concepts but requires a lot of time to fully grasp the main idea. One of the best professor I had at Rutgers. | This class is one of the most difficult in Chemical Engineering. She tends to over simplify things in lecture and then in exams, make it extremely difficult. Be prepared to work in groups outside of class as well. She stutters which makes it difficult to pay attention in class but she is a very nice person to work with on an individual basis. | Buettner is very dedicated and capable of portraying complex ideas to students more clearly than many other professors. | it's nerve racking just to listen to her lectures, takes for ever to explain something, but then nothing is clearly explained. she expects people to read her mind or something. gives 0s on HW with only suspicion. she knows the stuff but just doesn't know how to communicate them with students. better off reading the text book | She does not know how to teach the class. All she does is dish out formulas and expect you to know how to apply them to the homework. Class examples are almost completely irrelevant to the homework. You're better off going to the TA's office hours in order to learn anything, because you certainly won't from her."
"Tomassone, Maria","Worst professor I ever had. Her accent is barely understandable and the classes focus on long proofs. No concepts, no explanations, just long mathematical proofs which are not exam material. I had to self-taught the subject to get in the position of dong the exam. Annoying approach and useless classes. | She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. The course is quite challenging and technical, and her lectures have a lot of material to digest but she provides a lot of review problems / previous exams. The exams are almost exactly like the review problems and she gives a lot of partial credit. | Had this professor for Transport 1 during Fall 2020. The lectures were online and synchronous, but they were recorded for those that didn't attend class. Pros: clear grading criteria (you'll learn her ""method"" for solving problems), practice exams were uploaded, and grading was fair. Cons: The exams are worth a lot of the grade. Study. | Cares a lot for her students and wants you to do well. But she is a very unorganized lecturer and her notes are all over the place. The best case scenario is to just rewrite her lecture notes after class from Sakai and that will teach you the most. | Dr. Tomassone is one of the best professors I've had at Rutgers! She's really passionate about the subject and her enthusiasm was apparent during every lecture. Motivated students to study well and exams were challenging but fair. She also genuinely wants her students to succeed. You'll definitely not regret having her as a professor! | Tomassone was a great professor. She consistently came into class with a lot of energy and passion and loved teaching the class. Thats being said she doesnt take kindly to people skipping class or leaving early and will call you out and embarrass you in front of everyone. She wants everyone to do well, and will help you if you ask her. | Dr. T is one of my favorite ChemE professors. Caring, kind, motivational and persistent. She makes learning Tranport I fun. The class is tough, don't be fooled. But if you want to get something out of your Fall semester, take Transport I with Dr. T. You will not be disappointed. | She really cares about students. Try your best to show up every lecture. But if you miss it, luckily she does post her lecture notes online. A very accessible professor outside class as well. The material was easy only if you are good with vector calculus and some elementary differential equation skills. If you got those down, it will be a breeze. | Tomassone is such an AMAZING professor. Class is not so hard if you study. she does go a fast so you really need to keep up from the beginning. go to office hours tho and she will help u A LOT. wish she taught more classes | insane class :( goes at a fast pace you cant catch up with anything. Final is cumulative and i have no clue what in the world is going on.. h.w. is not really helpful to exams because she has her own ways of answering problems. she says she cares about students but yet criticizes their knowledge making it hard to ask questions. probably getting F | The material is difficult overall bet she genuinely wants you to do well. Very friendly, take advantage of office hours and get to know her and she will help you at a lot. | cares about student body, pushes down on gas pedal to make you learn..wonderful professor!!wish she taught more core classes | Her lectures aren't helpful at all for the (plentiful) homework assignments she gives. She is helpful outside of class though, and she is a very fair grader. | She is one of the best professors I 've had so far. She is dedicated to her students and will make sure you will understand. Great teacher. | Great teacher. If you spend atleast 3 hours a week on her class youll get the A. Also if you have trouble with hwk go to office hours they are sooo helpful | She is dedicated to helping students understand the material... but she is hard to find in her office, and focuses on long proofs that aren't on exams. She's a better professor of Transport I than of Thermo I, but still not great organizationally. It's possible to do well, but she expects you to put her class first. | She goes faaaast!!! so try to keep up. Other than that she is great, she will try to help you understand, so she cares. She does a lot of proof and derivations so... it is a bit time consuming. She has an accent (I like it), lol but can still understand her, She gives alot of hw. I thinks she is fine. | Good professor, she goes pretty fast though, so you have to keep up with the material. However, she tries to help her students as much as possible (she's willing to do one-on-one meetings, which are really helpful). Exams are do-able if you do the homework and study the material. Does way too many proofs though... | Pretty difficult class. Good prof, moves a little fast. High-level math involved in proofs of theorems but simplifies down to Calc3/4 level. Final was slightly ambiguous (as far as implying a method of solution, but I suppose that is how real problems are encountered); all-in-all a good course."
"Androulakis, Ioannis","Your grade is basically determined by 4 kind of difficult exams, but luckily he gave a lot of extra credit that you had to earn. Typically it would be 200 points + 75 bonus. The lectures were kind of boring, but he does care about your grades. He makes the standard for an A a 95 which is kind of high. 25% got an A but 25% failed. | I think hes a great professor and a really nice guy. he goes over things thoroughly in lecture and answers questions until hes sure we understand it. if you put in the effort, you will be fine in this class | New to teaching MATLAB and knows what he needs to do in MATLAB but has a hard time explaining what to do. Ask lots of questions and he will be able to clarify a lot of things. He wants you to do well and wants to help you get that A | Professor Androulakis was genuinely the worst professor Ive ever had the misfortune of taking at Rutgers. His entire grading scheme was based off 3 take home exams, no HW no quizzes. His lectures do NOT prepare you for the exams and are unintuitive and essentially useless. This is strictly a MatLab course that should be treated as such. | I think professor Yannis is very cute and very kind! Sometimes tough with exams but if you go to his office hours and explain what you wrote he will give patial credit and that's what I like most about him! He listens to what students say and tries not to be mean even if the question is stupid. the lectures can get a bit boring but he is sweet. | Professor Androulakis was one of the worst professors I've had at Rutgers. Every question a student had was responded to with anger and annoyance, his grading scale was inconsistent, and lectures were hard to follow. Posted all his slides online and exams weren't that difficult, but a tough learning environment | need help? ask him. go for office hrs. one of the best professors i ever had. | hes the man, real cool guy, exams are straight from lecture and the hw | No Comments | Funny, helpful, easy to understand, a change from boring, lifeless engineering professors. I just wish he would stop calling on me so much."
"Chiew, Yee","Professor Chiew has a fair course but his grading is incredibly tough. Forget a Negative sign, thats 1/2 the points off the question. He is also the literal worst undergraduate director this school has to offer. Chiew DOES NOT CARE if you graduate or get a job. He does nothing to help the students find internships or full time jobs. | An extremely caring professor who wants to see you do well but will not just give you an A. You have to work hard and show him that you care and he will do the same for you. | Thermo II with Dr Chiew was great! Though class was at 8:40 am, professor Chiew was always upbeat and understanding of how tedious those can be. Learned something new during his lectures and the course was intellectually challenging in a good way. Forces you to move past base level learning. Accessible outside of class to answer questions! | Great professor. Really loves what he does. His passion shows and it's refreshing for us. Be ready to work for your grade. But he is very simple, and humble. Don't talk in class. He's always willing to help. Take him. | Explains concepts in class,but does not solve problems. Gives difficult problems as homework and expect difficult problems in exams. Read the koretsky book and solve problems from Koretsky to do well in MT and FInals. Sit in the first bench and meet him personally with your doubts. Very friendly and kind. Don't talk in the class. | Assignments assigned were very hard! Be prepared to work extremely hard! His lectures are awesome and explains concepts very clearly. Would gladly take his class again! | He is an amazing professor, but come to the exams really prepared because they are lengthy and he is a tough grader. And go to class, even if it's early (ours was 8:40am). His lectures are really helpful! | Chiew is awesome the professor chemical engineering has to offer however his exams can be marathons | Absolutely the best !!! | HE IS THE MAN!!!!!! Who knew nerdy could be this hotttt?!?! Great guy - funny Chiew-isms!!!! | The Best ! | Dr. Chiew wins the best professor award every year. He is the best! | No Comments | THE BEST CHEM E PROFESSOR IN THE DEPT"
"Schuster, Benjamin","A good professor for a tough class. He's very straight forward with what he wants and will give you useful notes on how to achieve it. He doesn't hide anything and basically tells you what to do to get a good grade. He is a tough grader though, so really listen to his advice. | Nice professor but very strict grader. If you make the changes he suggests on your comments you will do well, otherwise you will get the same grade. Stay after class and talk about the comments, it will help. | Interesting professor. I had him fro basic comp and so long as you take his comments to heart you will receive a better grade on your next paper. Not a bad guy at all. | hard grader, i already go to every class and finish the assignment, but also get NP in his class. Do not take this professor if you want to get a higher grade. | He is a good professor, but he is a hard grader. If one wants to do good in his class better go to his office hours a lot. Always work on the mistakes he points out. | He was a pretty good professor...seems mean at first but when you actually talk to him he is pretty approachable. Very helpful, but you have to make the time to go to his office hours. I thought the class would be an easy A, but I ended up with a B so I suggest taking another easy A writing class to fulfill the requirement. | can be boring but he usually lets out 15 minutes early, grades hard on papers but if you make the corrections he wants you'll get a good grade on the final paper which is only grade that really matters. nice guy, approachable, will teach you how to write papers for the rutgers writing department's (stupid) format. C+ to B+ range for most of class | The Civil War: Not the easiest class but defintley the professor I have learned the most from at Rutgers thus far. Really changed how I write my college papers. | worst teacher ever. not helpful. Boring as hell classes, all he does is talks to you about boring things. You ask him a question and he says to look at the syllabus and doesnt even answer the question. Dont take the class with him. Wait till another teacher opens up, i heard gang is amazing!"
"Zhang, Haoran","She's a very sweet woman who wants you to do well. Out of the 3 lecturers, she definitely had the best slides and examples. Sometimes her handwriting was messy, but was very responsive to questions. | I studied by myself for entire semester cuz I barely understood what she says in the lecture. You better be familiar with using textbook if your planning to take this professor. | Is not very helpful when it comes to breaking down problems and concepts. | Orgo at Rutgers is just rough. I found her lectures hard to follow and her explanations during them fairly poor. But, her lecture notes are decent to study from. I would take this prof if you are good at teaching yourself material. Study often and at least two weeks prior to exams since there is so much content and your grade is only exams. | Not the best professor, but she is accessible outside of class and cares about her students doing well. Ask for help, ask questions, and read the textbook and do the practice problems. | Orgo at Rutgers is not great regardless of professors. Zhang is a nice lady but randomly starts laughing during her lectures. She does not do a great job explaining material. You learn mostly during homework problems but then exams questions seem to be completely different (at least online). She is willing to explain if you do not understand."
"Bertuccio, Alex","Dr. B always brings a lot of enthusiasm to class making it easy to be engaged. Dr. B's objectives are clear, with much of what he emphasizes being valuable in the work field. I learned exceptional habits for presenting, technical writing, and conveying/interpreting data that I continue to use on many occasions in my professional career. | This class requires a lot of your time and effort, and your grade is a reflection of that. Expect to do lots of independent research for your experiments. However, Dr. B is always there for questions and any advice that you need. He's always shown genuine care for his students and the ChemE department, and we're lucky to have him! | Process Lab evaluates students on a different skill set than in most other classes. The expectations and guidelines are frequently and clearly explained, so any student can succeed in this course. Dr. B is very willing to meet with students as much as they need & does what it takes to ensure that effectively motivated students learn something. | Dr. Bertuccio became one of my favorite professors within the Rutgers CBE department because I took his class. I looked forward to attending lecture every week, and I learned a lot of useful information pertaining to actually working in the industry. I've heard he is a tough grader but he's clear about the criteria you're being graded on. | Avoid his class if you can. You can do your work, but if he decides he doesnt like you, he will make your life harder. Between his blatant favoritism and lack of flexibility due to other circumstances; the class was less than ideal. | Effort 1/3 of final grade and he says he grades effort objectively(how?). He says an ""A"" is work that succeeds his expectations and ""would be worthy of a promotion in industry"" (just say exactly what you want, sir). Ambiguous w his assignments, gives groups diff info and thinks everyone is always on the same page. Made no allowances for pandemic. | He is probably the only ChemE professor you'll find who really cares. You literally just need to do the assignments to get an A. | Dr. B wants the best for his students, but the amount of nonsense, ridiculous, and downright idiotic ""busy bee"" work we are given is incomprehensible. Is it his fault if the department forces him to adhere to ABET and spend 1 year making students unprepared for real chemE ? No, but unfortunately he is the messenger that was blamed. | He's a good guy, projects are slightly boring, but it's the departments fault! He's truly trying to train better engineers. | He is a very nice professor overall. Gives good amount of homework but it is graded on completion. He is willing to provide time outside of class if student needs extra help. He follows very strict grading criteria for lab reports e.g. graph format and presentation design . If you do all the things he explains in lecture then you will do fine . | One of the best classes I have taken. Dr. Bertuccio really likes what he is talking about here, and he makes all of us like it. He is also really chill, as well as funny. If you get the chance to take him, I advise it. You will have a good time. | Give lot of homework and assignments."
"Ramachandran, Rohit","One of the worst classes I've ever taken at Rutgers. Lectures are unclear and are not related to the assignments or exams he gives. The syllabus wasn't accurate, and you aren't taught the necessary things to complete a lot of the assignments. Matlab is a very big part of the class, and he expects you to just know what he wants. Not taught well. | Kind of helpful outside of class and makes himself available for students but that's about it when it comes to good things about him. The class is the worst taught class in the entire curriculum, lectures are not clear, assignments and exam based on matlab functions he doesn't even go over and expects you to just know. Grading is also super harsh. | Took him for Advanced Thermodynamics and we didn't even delve into actual thermodynamics. It was more about just probability and completing the project which was actually going to contribute to this research rather than any thermodynamic learning."
"Celik, Fuat","Really hard class, and almost impossible to get help. | It is really hard to get help in his class. I enjoy his passion and knowledge and he triggers my interest on engery. But the way he teaches this course really makes me frustrated and upset. I believe the course was not that hard but he made it harder than it should be. | I would suggest transferring to another university to finish up my senior year than take this class with Dr. Celik. | Arrogant and inconsiderate when approached with something you are struggling with. Provides minimal explanation on the criteria for the senior design project/final report. Rude and doesn't see you as a person, sees himself as some bigshot boss and you as some intern who does not matter. Class requires Windows OS but is not held in a computer lab. | One of the brightest, most admirable, and motivational professors Ive had. He will respect you if you put in the work, plain and simple. Just like a boss at work. He is very lenient, and forgiving. Dont expect everything to be handed to you, this is real life! Dr. Celik prepares you for bosses who challenge you in the real workforce. | He is sooo arrogant, and petty! His lecture is boring!!! | He always feels he is the smartest person in the whole world. He didn't give much detail on class and thinks you should know all. Once he felt unsatisfied with you, then he will always underrstimate you. i do think he discriminates non-native students. Never wanna take his course again! | He gives minimal details on what he wants then grades you based on how you read his mind. His expectations are too high and has so much ego in himself and thinks he's the smartest person. Not to mention he is very rude and discriminates towards non-native English speakers. would never want to take again, worst experience! | I would not ever describe him as ""charming"". The homeworks were ridiculously hard, and Dr. Celik is rather inflexible when it comes to deviating from his syllabus. At times, he has acted as if he is the smartest man in the world, which is annoying. I did well in the course, but it could have been more enjoyable. | Very smart and charming professor. He really knows what he's teaching. All materials are derived clearly. (maybe math-intensive but that's why this class is great. ChemE are too qualitative.) And fair grading. You can get most of the credits if you show your method and it doesn't matter whether you get wrong answer.Best prof! | Very difficult class and materials. Professor is hard and strict. However, he gives fair grades at the end based on improvements."
"Nassif, Hani","He is really the most tough graded i have ever seen in my life. | 1. TA will do everything. 2. No feedback. 3. Study by yourself. 4. Rate 2.5/5 professor will give you 2/4 C for your GPA. | This Professor does not take any accommodations to help students. Even getting a reply from him was difficult. Did not like | Doesnt ever actually go over any design and leaves you to learn everything yourself. More stress from one class than all of college combined. | He doesn't do many examples in class and his lectures aren't very helpful. We were forced to use vaious design codes and were confused as to what we needed to do. he rarely updated the class website and was inconsistent in his due dates and information. He also makes you feel awkward when you anser a question in class which isn't 100% correct. | He left lecture early usually. You have to study on your own, but this course only requires you to do many practices, and that is it. He taught us more than just lectures. He inspires students. | Very helpful and understanding. Made final optional to replace lowest exam grade. Allowed take-home of previous exams to correct for extra points. Very clear in lecture and makes sure that everyone in the class is on the same page. Very nice guy also | I'm amazed at the negative review this professor received. He's an incredible professor who cares about each of his students. I asked him if he knew any tutors and he told me to just come to office hours every week so he can see how to more effectively help me understand the concepts. This class is very hard though! Do the homework and you'll be ok | The professor is helpful, he focuses a lot on the field experience instead of class teaching. Recommended to all civil easy tests way too easy compared to the hw | Nassif is the worst professors I had so far.I understood nothing he taught.He gave quizzes on the chapter that we haven't started doing homework on. He didn't solve problems on the board, he just read his power point presentations and expected us to know the solutions. Problems on midterm were not even similar to the homework. Avoid if possible! | This guy is something else. I never had this guy before so I took prestressed with him. Spent ALOT of time reading Nawy's horrible book and teaching myself. This guys exams are completely unable to be studied for. Just know what's being covered and do your best (I got an A and thought I failed both Midterm and Final) but he's a nice guy overall | He is one professor who deffinetely knows everything about his subject, but is completely incompetent with passing the knowledge to his students. he puts all his effort into his research and does not care about his courses. his notes and handouts are ambiguous, solppy, and impossible to follow. Never again! | One of the worst in Civil Engineering. Arrogant. Avoid if possible. | Can be intimidating, is actually a nice guy, if he sees that you are making a good effort you will get a decent grade | great professor | unclear, doesn't have a plan that is good. spends many classes thinking about how to solve problems, instead of solving them. | hard headed, extremely unclear ,and thinks he is an expert in his field !!!!don't recomend taking his class . | worst professor you could ever take! unclear, old & boring! | he is an excellent professor | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments"
"Brenner, Alfred","One of the best professors in Rutgers. The only professor that I'm going to be sad about that the semester is over. Professor Brenner will try to know you as a person and he really cares about your future. If you show up to class, you basically pass the class, but don't worry, lecture is never boring."
"Yong, Yook-Kong","Took him for Solids. Lectures were very boring and hard to keep up with. Grade breakdown relies heavily on midterms, so you have to do well on them in order to do well in the class. On the other hand, midterm questions are textbook level problems, so they are not too hard if you know what you're doing. | hes a cool guy i got no questions right and still got an 86 on a midterm pretty slay IMO will update soon kisses | Nice guy but not a very good professor. He is quite old so you have to really speak up when you want to ask a question, and he comes in to lean in on you to hear better which can be kind of embarrassing in front of the rest of the rest of the class. He goes over few examples in class, so you have to learn quite a bit of the material on your own. | Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section. | Nice guy, tries to make jokes. Lectures are essentially from the textbook. He does give helpful tips about certain strategies for problems though, so maybe have a friend who goes to class. Tests are graded fair, and you can ask him for a regrade of a problem if you think you deserve a few more points. | He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting. | I would def recommend this prof. If you do the homework that is given every week from the textbook, you will be good for the exam. He basically does problems form the txtbk in class, so you dont need to go to class but I would recommend going anyway. He is also really understanding so if you did poorly on the exam, go to him!!!! and he will help!! | You will pretty much have to teach this course to yourself. He only goes over the examples from the textbook in class and is unclear. Nice guy but horrible lecturer. | Decent professor, only does examples from book in class so you basically teach yourself all the material. Material isn't too difficult. Little homework so grade is based off midterm and final only. | Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve. | Excellent professor! His examples in class are straight from the text book. He is very funny also, however a little antisocial. Sometimes for his exams will give you something crazy that you have not seen before. Easy grader. He is always 5 - 10 minutes late to class and tries to make up the lost time by forcing the class to stay 5 minutes longer | He was never really organized. Last semester, he planned on covering at least 10 chapters but we ended up barely doing seven. He wasted a lot of time in class fully reviewing an example from the previous lecture or trying to get the microphone to work even though we could hear him fine without it. | He is good in explaining things if you just ask him. He is polite and as said before, he does examples from the text in lectures and he'll be happy to go over h.w. problems before they are due. he's cool | Very easy class. Most of the material is from Mechanics of Solids. Very little new material. Overall, exams are not bad. In class he just does examples from the book, but it's still worth it to go. | As long as you read the book you are okay. | He's a really nice guy but doesn't always seem to understand questions. Homework is minimal. | He's a pretty good teacher, tries to keep you interested, and if you pay attention/do hw you should be fine"
"Mazurek, Monica","shes a really nice professor. I took this class for my civil science elective I believe. She talks a lot and its in a computer lab so most of the class I'm on reddit or something. That is my fault but she is not really clear and can get off topic. Long story short I did really bad on both exams and well on the presentation and got a B+ | Not helpful at all, sent her emails but got one-word replies. She didn't even seem to understand what she was teaching, her replies to in-class questions were even more confusing. Definitely not worth taking, I know a lot about the subject but she made it confusing | she's a sweet professor, who really wants you to learn; her class isn't a cakewalk though; be sure to study EVERYTHING in your class notes and class activities and you'll ace exams; grades things a little late & tells you things last min, but if you are a passionate in environ. sciences/engineering TAKE this class; it's worth your time | No Comments"
"Fahrenfeld, Nicole","Overall a very understanding professor. She accepted my late homework's and exams were definitely fair. I also liked the point distributions since she gave a decent amount of points for the project and discussions it wasn't just strictly exams. Show up and come prepared like she tells you and you'll be fine. | Great professor, knowledgeable and cares about the class | Her lectures are pretty straight forward and she makes the material pretty easy to understand. However any time I went to office hours or emailed her she was never helpful. Would never give straight answers and refused to clarify topics when I had questions on the homework. Do not rely on her for help... | She is the best. Print out her power points, go to class, and take notes so you know how to do the multiple choice problems. Actually figure out the homeworks by yourself or with a group of friends. If you know the homeworks, you'll be fine on all the calculation problems. Get the fpdf for the textbook. You'll be fine | she is pretty easy beside her exam consist of true , false, multiple choices, open ended. she is pretty good looking ! | Could be a much harder class but isn't too difficult. Gives clear notes, TRY not too get any of the multiple choice questions wrong on the exam because there barely is a curve. | Straight forward class, she lectures, works through examples, and then answers questions. The multiple choice on the exams is make or break for your grade because she barely curves the class."
"Gong, Jie","She's really nice and stops to answer all questions. I had her when she was teaching 344 the first time and she didn't have any previous exams for us to practice. When we asked her for practice problems, she made them for every exam. She's accommodating and gave extensions when needed. Exams were bit difficult, but she was teaching the first time. | LEGEND LEGEND LEGEND!!!! | 5.3/5 | The 5.3/5 rating speaks for itself, even RMP can't handle how good this professor is | The curve is very reasonable. She records her lectures (which are pretty good). Only caveat with her is that she makes the exams very hard but gives a ton of extra credit on them so it balances out. | This was a very difficult class, but Gao gave a generous curve at the end. She is a very nice person and willing to help. I found the class fast paced and hard to follow, but I am grateful that she was understanding and receptive to student feedback throughout the semester. | Lectures were enough to give u the general idea of the subject but the hws were incredibly difficult in comparison (most likely because this was her first time teaching the undergrad version of algos she usually teaches the graduate version). With that being said gao graded very leniently and was very easy to approach for help | Reviewing for CS344. Not a bad professor, and by far the best thing was that she recorded her lectures for the entire semester. She also gives plentiful hints for homework assignments. On the other hand, this class is incredibly difficult. Homework takes up so much time and her exams are tough. Expect to work hard for a good grade in this class. | Incredible professor with extremely helpful lectures. The examples from lecture and homework problems serve as good examples involving the concepts from class. Professor Gao is also incredibly caring, as indicated by her grading and open-note exam policy, among others. I learned a lot in this class while finishing with above a 100%. | This was Gaos first time teaching undergraduate algorithms course (usually she teaches the graduate level) as a result the class was fast paced and incredibly difficult. With that being said Gao recorded lectures, allowed open note exams, and graded very leniently and generously. | This professor was soo nice. She was very easy to talk to and very understanding on your situation. When emailed she would try the best to figure out a good solution to help you. All in all a great and sweet teacher | Took CS344. 5-6 typed HWs (40%), Midterm (30%) and Final (30%). Midterm and final are open notes, but she switched to 5 pages printed rather than digital for the final. HWs are moderately difficult, but she grades very lightly, so a 90% average on HW is achievable. Records and uploads lectures. Gives hints for HWs on piazza and during exams. | She is so nice and always willing to give extensions on homework assignments. Grading on tests was also lenient and she was very generous with giving back points if there were ever mistakes on quiz or exam questions. She also answers emails very quickly and hosted an extra office hours before our final since a few students requested. | Actual best professor at rutgers. Take her any chance you get, so helpful on assignments, willing to regrade and look over any questions the TA's might have marked wrong. Wants to help you succeed and pass, very forgiving yet still learned a lot. Feel prepped for discrete 2, she is the absolute best and a gem in the cs department especially here. | W professor. Class itself is hard but she is amazing and sweet. | I took Discrete I Spring 2023. She gives weekly online quizzes that are open notes. There is only one midterm followed by the final, both of which are open notes. Recitation is optional; all the lecture material is posted online after class. The homework and quizzes will actually require reading/understanding the slides. Overall great professor | The best prof at rutgers. She is so sweet and caring, willing to help, and really wants to see the class do well. She extended homeworks and quizzes multiple times, explains things thoroughly and will go over something again if you ask. 11/10 | Professor Gao is a nice professor, clear helpful slides, but her handwriting was very tough to understand. She quickly replied to emails and tried to help solve queries in office hours. Hard to understand her Discrete 1 especially HW, quizzes and midterms without prior outside class practice. Practice other than lecture or its hard to understand!! | Take Professor Gao for Discrete 1!! She was very easy and understanding of your needs. 4 hws, and 2 midterms + 1 final but it was very straightforward and as long as you study, you should be fine!! | Good teacher! She addresses questions and responds to emails fast. Make sure you read the textbook. Tho at times, she messed up Canvas quizzes and caused confusion with grading. Nbd tho, and overall a nice professor. | Professor Gao is a good professor across the board. She's nice, she quickly responds to emails, and puts effort in her concept explanations. She also responds well to questions or confusion. I only wish she provided more examples as Discrete 1 is kind of challenging to understand. Do practice problems outside of just her lectures. | Professor Gao is a great professor! She explains concepts really well, and is willing to spend time answering questions. She also responds to emails promptly. Her quizzes and homework sets are not too bad, and the midterm was a similar format to the homework sets! | Professor Gao is really good. She doesn't mind explain specific part multiple times during class or office hour. The homework sets are little bit hard but it won't be a problem if you start it early or go to her office hour. You can schedule extra appointments. She is kind cuz she dropped lowest quiz and gave extra credit. | Professor Gao was really understanding. My TA was a really harsh grader and I would go to the professor and she would personally regrade my assignments. I also had some tech issues and she was understanding of that too. | I had Gao for discrete 1. Overall she is a super sweet professor who will not mind re-explaining concepts to confused students. The material and psets are hard to understand but it is clear that she tries her best to clarify everything. She gave us extra credit and dropped our lowest quiz grade so I highly recommend | The notes barely help with the homework or the tests/quizzes because she only just reads off a powerpoint that only shows the worst examples. Try to get a different professor."
"Arafa, Mohamed","This professor is a great guy and Worth taking if you want to learn the language. Best language professor here and makes you want to come to class. Every single student comes to class because of how great he is, including me. Definitely taking him again! | Great teacher, class was much more fun, intresting. He teaches in a way you can understand. | I took Alsiadi for my Arabic class, and it was a waste of my time, effort, and money. He rambles often and much of his teaching methods aren't helpful. A few students had to drop this class, and many others would often leave before dismissal. Save your time and money; there are other better ways to learn Arabic. | Judging by the other comments I guess I had him during a bad semester. He did not follow the syllabus but jumped around a lot. Very rude and arrogant, occassionally funny. I tried a number of times to meet with him before class but he often did not appear for office hours. ""Explanations"" were frequently unclear. Personally, wouldn't recommend. | He's an awesome instructor...very clear and helpful...take him if you really want to master the language | He's by far the bestest teacher at Rutgers for language. Attendance is definitely mandatory but i missed a few probably 5classes but still ended up with an A. He might be a jerk but thats jus his sense of humor some people cant stand him but i really like him and think hes a great prof. Def takin arabic 2 with him. MUST TAKE HIM | Always makes class fun, and you can tell he just knows a lot and he will try to teach you a lot but be prepared to work. Participation is really important to him. | I LOVE ALSIADI! he is the coolest professor ever, i wish i could take him for the rest of my life, he really cares about his students and he has a great sense of humor! | Best teacher. So much knowledge. Loves to teach and share wisdom. Always studying the language in his free time. Great man | This was a challenging intro. The professor was real cool, but be ready to work...and I think he definatley caters to the arabic speaking students, which was, for me, 95% of the class. | great professor and really fun class. knows his stuff and presents it in a way that is easy to understand. good professor to have for those with no background in the language. | Alsiadi is awesome. He knows his stuff, he's fun in class, and there are never any awkward ""teacher""/""student"" moments. Take him if you want an awesome and challenging introduction to Arabic. ""If you want him show you respect, you show him also."" | After two bad experiences with Arabic at Rutgers, finally a professor that not only knows his stuff extremely well, but who is patient and caring. If you want to learn the language and have a good time doing it, take this guy | great teacher. He seems intimidating at first, but once the course gets going, he is pretty funny. He is good about explaining things. Just keep up with the work. | He's not really hot, he's old and married, not ugly but whatever, still a great teacher, likes to joke around and is cool as long as you're NOT late or absent. Just go to class and pay attention and you'll do well, quizzes and tests are easy. Also do homework, it's easy and you learn alot. | Very clear and thorough in explination of the Arabic grammar. Challenging, diverse and entertaining lecturer. Not very flexible with absences, though. And, yes, very easy on the eyes | He is great! His lectures are interesting and he doesn't overload you with information. The tests are challenging, but if you work hard you can get B's and A's. I would highly recommend this class!! | very helpful | wonderful teacher, teaching style is different, don't take this class if you want an easy A, you have to work for it but it's not impossible, everyone should take Arabic with him, loved the class and he's very helpful | He is a wonderful teacher, an interesting lecturer, and very easy on the eyes. | if you work very hard you will get B+ | very helpful | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments"
"Moon, Franklin","Professor Moon is amazing and I'm really upset he's not teaching Indeterminate Structures next semester. I wish every civil engineering class at Rutgers was taught by him! His notes are very organized and he goes over many examples in class. Always really helpful during office hours. Just take him, you won't regret it | First semester he taught a course here at Rutgers, and he did an exceptional job. Had elements of structures with him and he was extremely lucid in his teaching style and notes. His exams didnt try to trick you at all and he tried his best to help every student. He is a very nice guy. Extremely intelligent and respected professor."
"Miskewitz, Robert","Honestly outstanding. I do not usually enjoy physics, I dreaded physics I and II. However, I was excited every week to go to his class and always left the class having really enjoyed lectures. The professor is engaging and very passionate about environmental science. It is a more difficult class, but I could not ask for a better professor. | He's a good teacher, but can go on tangents sometimes about stuff that doesn't pertain to coursework. The textbook is required, but a pdf copy is usually passed around the students if you ask around you will find it. Take clear notes of the equations he gives because you will need to fall back on them, exams allow 1-2 page equation sheets. | I took Physical Principles and Fate & Transport with him. He expects a lot in terms of retention from prior lectures and really pushes lectures to be participatory, to an intimidating extent. On the flip side he is very energetic, and has a lot of experience. He also does not post very much material online so you absolutely cannot miss class. | Terrible"
Jin Jing,"Clear teaching, sexy voice! | Bo is the best Matlab TA Rutgers has to offer. His students always have the highest percentage of A's in Matlab and that's all because Bo teaches extremely well. He gives great tips and is extremely lenient on grading and never fails to make you laugh during class. Make sure he's your TA, you won't regret it!"
"Maher, Ali","Very easy professor again. Prior knowledge is of python is not necessary. He will teach you everything needed. A lot of homework but that helps with your grade. Up to 3 projects too. A lot of students are grads and they work, so he's okay with a flexible schedule. | Very easy professor. Prior knowledge is not necessary. A lot of homeworks but that helps with your grade. Up to 3 projects too. A lof of students are grads and they work, so he's okay with a flexible schedule."
"Godrich, Hana","Professor Godrich was fantastic this semester. Her online lectures were clear for those who needed them, but she kept them optional for those who didn't. She pushed back 5-10 deadlines over the course of the semester to help us manage workload better between the main course & lab. Drops lowest exam & lowest lab grade. Overall very clear & caring. | Well organized, always ready for help outside of class, and a good person overall. Very understanding of the tough situation with corona and is willing to push back some deadlines. So good that I made a rate my professor account just for her. | Professor Godrich has been absolutely incredible this semester. Not only was the course extremely organized in the online format, but she also did an amazing job of teaching the course material. Homework and quizzes may take some time, but they are perfect preparation for exams. Super kind and caring, and truly wants her students to succeed. | Taken during COVID, She was very understanding and available to give extra time if needed. She explained really well in class, and was always available for extra help during Office hours and by email. She is a goddess and should be treated as such. | Amazing professor, super helpful, her lectures and lecture slides are extremely clear. Quizzes + exams are not very hard but definitely need to put in the time and effort, don't worry tho because Prof. Godrich prepares you to do well in the class. | She's the most amazing professor I have come across in the ECE department. She cares like a mother, delivers her lectures like a pro, has a great sense of directionality in her lectures and goes up and beyond to help students get the best out of their time in the class. Extra co-operative and totally understanding advisor! | This professor is most likely the greatest professor in the whole department. Her lectures are great, she is very caring, and she is very passionate about teaching. Definitely an amazing professor that wants students to do well. | Pretty straight forward class, with easy assignments and material compared to other ECE classes. People still forget to submit the assignments and could end up failing so watch out for that. 10 page cheat sheet for one midterm. theres a group project and project paper. overall a breeze | She is a nice professor , and she makes easy PEE1 even easier ; the exams are easy and her weekly quizzes are also easy.. However the lectures are kinda boring because she uses slides and an ipad. I actually recommend skipping her lecture and just read the slides at home and attend the recitations as the TAs recap everything and do like 4-5problems | Probably the best professor I've had so far. You can learn everything from the slides she posts online alone and nothing else. I've never even seen the textbook. Heard her lectures were good too. All you need to do is read the slides and go to her reviews. | Exams were kinda hard, but she is very clear when explaining the material. The lectures are kinda boring though. | Her Top hat quizzes are very easy and simple. Homework is also fairly easy if you understand the material. The tests can be slightly difficult but like the homework if you understand the material well you can pass easily. Recommend looking at Mesh current and Node voltage before Test 1, as well as systems with multiple voltage and current sources. | Godrich is a great professor. Mandatory attendance and mini-quizzes in class. Her exams were tough. But you can get good grades if you studied the material well. Her slides (uploaded) are important and also make sure to attend the optional recitations and reviews she does. A good resource is Ravel Ammerman on YouTube. | She was a great teacher and always crystal clear, the notes she uploads to sakai are easy to understand as well."
"Mammone, Richard","If I had to do it over again, I would take electives till another prof is available. Lectures consist of reading off a large Word doc. However, Word doesn't handle pictures well and it would be better if he used slides. The class is hard since homework is a small percent and tests are the rest, if you fail the first test, its pretty much over. | He just read off a word document during class and it was really hard to learn from that. The tests are also your whole grade and there's no partial credit so if you make one small mistake it could cost you a lot. I didn't learn much from lecture but after doing the homework things started to make sense. I wouldn't take any other class he teaches. | Super straightforward with his notes and teaching. Very time-efficient and usually ends class early. Tests are super fair and straight from the homework. He was also very accomodating for the switch to online. One test was unexpectedly hard for most of us, so he gave a generous curve to it even after mentioning this class came with no curves. | Acts more as a friend than as a professor with his students. Is not arrogant. Also, he improvised makeup exams when our grades struggled. If you are nice with him and take this class seriously, he is very genuine, caring and tries to help you out. But if you appear not interested the class/entitled, he will not give you favors and acts coldly. | Best professor I've ever had. hands down. Hand him for two classes and I wish I could have him for the rest! Truly a great guy, I wish he could adopt me. He has definitely helped me educationally and personally. AMAZING | Best professor I've ever had. He's straight up and wants everyone to pass. He helps but doesn't hand hold you throughout the whole semester. The coursework is easy, simple math and logic. Just DO THE HW, his exams come straight from the textbook and/or notes. and again, PEE1 IS EASY. | Pretty simple A, just do what he asks you to do regarding the only thing you get graded on: a semester long group project. He's not a bad dude, more of ""this is how life is"" kinda guy that might brush you the wrong way. Wasn't a problem for me though. Do what you need to do regarding your project and you'll get the A. | I had him for Design Thinking Innovation. Honestly, the class was an easy A. It feels like he's there just to get paid and would give everyone an A if he could. It's an easy A if you simply do what he asks, which isn't much. The class is pretty much one big group project + presentation. No midterm/final. A bit boring at times but really easy. | Really learned a lot in this class - tech is not only electronic gadgets but involves a whole lot more. Great course for scientists/engineers who want to learn how they can use entrepreneurship as a way for their research to have large impact on society. | Prof. Mammone's Technology Entrepreneurship class was interesting and insightful, it opened up an avenue to entrepreneurship based on scientific and entrepreneurial talent that I was not aware of. He took us through the mechanics of starting successful high tech companies. Want to build the next Google or Facebook? Take this class! | Good prof. for this graduate course. He knows the subject, takes a practical approach, & grades fairly. Exams are similar to the homework. The book was not good - too much abstract theory. But Mammone saw the problem and spent the next lecture explaining the math in understandable terms. Calculators are ok and he does curve if necessary. | Pay close attention to his notes and hw because the exams are exactly questions from hw and exams but numbers are just changed. Good profesor and helpful. | .. | Very nice professor, very helpfull and interesting. Don't listen those poor guys since he is really a good professor and knows very his topic. so if you really like DSP he can definitely help you. so enjoy | Mammone takes college sophomores and treats them like they are back in freshman year of highschool. We deserve more respect. | often made exceptions to EE theories that went unjustified through proof, only to be later clarified, and muddled, by sanutti | No Comments | this man hates students, hates life....looks down on kids, thinks theres no hope for someone to do well if they mess up 1 exam. | has a superiority complex. doesnt like people walking in late, and will waste time telling people not to walk in late. | More or less just goes over examples from text. He's similar to those audio tapes that accompany books so you can read along. | 1/3 of the class will fail, the average on the final last yr wuz a 40 -mammone | definite ass. lectures astoundingly ineffective.hates life and all people | he didnt want to be there in the worst way, routinely cut class short | Professor Dick Mammone lives up to his name | He's an ass. exams not too bad. Final impossible."
"Caggiano, Michael","Awesome professor! 10/10 would recommend. Took 3 of his courses and loved the way he teaches. | Pass or fail class. Teacher speaks very softly, shows no emotion during lectures. He goes over different functions and stuff on excel but the tests/quizzes usually have nothing to do with it. Everything was online, class was only once a week. | Easy A if you can do the labs/hws . It's not hard. His lectures are confusing. He copies straight from his notes, so it's very hard to follow. I learn nothing though grading is very lenient. weekly lab (ltspice) with partner and weekly hw. No exams. Easy ltspice lab presentation with partner for one of the labs. Attendance not graded but a plus | Class can get so boring you won't want to come (gets really bad after the midterm), mixed in with some of his humor. 1 pop quiz so attendance is not mandatory but good luck passing if you dont come to class--he doesn't reference the textbook and everything is taught in class, but you can kinda use the textbook to self study (there are gaps). | Caggiano is a good professor but he is very sloppy when it comes to lectures. He is all over the place and sometimes is hard to understand because of the difference between topics. In the end, everything comes together but I personally got lost throughout the middle of the semester. He gives pop 3 pop quizzes per semester but he didn't my semester. | His homework solutions are wrong, his class notes are wrong, his notes are inconsistent. You teach yourself the material most of the time, and it's confusing. he wont give you circuits on the exams so better memorize what you drew in the class, even the most complicated looking ones. homework wont help you at all. very cool labs tho. | He is an amaizing professor. His tests are from what he did in class, and are very fair, he is also very good at teaching. The only issue is that I am never able to understand what goes on lecture, because I am too busy talking notes, and he doesnt post notes online. Also, Nothing makes sense when I look at the notes so I spend hours on youtube. | Although the attendance is not mandatory, YOU HAVE TO GO TO CLASS to actually pass since nothing he teaches is available in either textbooks or youtube. By the time you copy the board, youll miss out on important stuff he talks about. Exams are usually identical to his homework questions but there could be curve balls too. LEARN HOW TO DRAW CIRCUIT | Hes one of the few teachers that only teaches and doesn't do research. However, he doesn't put much effort into his classes. His textbook won't help you at all if you are trying to catch up and he won't put any kind of student resource online to help. His notes in class are all handwritten on a blackboard which really doesn't work for 300 students. | He is a tough grader. But this class is super useful and super interesting! He tries his best to teach some practical method of using different chips | He is a pretty good professor. He doesn't use slides or textbook material that much so you need to attend and take notes. Do the homework and try doing past midterms as he doesn't change them that much. The project is also super easy. His coordination with the TA's is terrible and recitations are kinda useless. The lab is fun and an easy A. | Caggiano gives all the notes you'll ever need to succeed in the course, in class. Textbook is used for homework and some supplemental reading, but reading cover to cover will not help you as much as attending lecture. He is patient, present at office hours. Work a little for the grade and it'll be easy to get an A | Just do the homework and you will do fine on both midterms and final. Curve depends on how the class goes throughout the semester. There's a small project | Caggiano has a great sense of humor, and Id say he is one of the best professors in the department. The textbook has no correlation, so do the hw and take notes, youll do fine. Exams are extremely fair | I did well on the first midterm, dunno about the second one yet, but regardless of my grade in this class he is just terrible at teaching this subject. His notes are a mess and half the time his solutions are wrong. His method of having you just memorize things is fine for DLD, but for DE it just does not work. Lu was much better than Caggiano. | HE GAVE RANDOM QUIZ DURING THE STORM/SNOW DAYS. If you will take his class, you will have 6+ page notes writing. He chose the class book which has 0 content related to his lecture in the purpose of letting everyone attend his class and busy at writing without thinking anything. Such a bad teacher. | Very straightforward with his exams. As long as you revise your notes and do the HW you should be good. He doesn't follow the book exactly so DO NOT SKIP. Even if you get the notes from somebody, they won't make sense since his commentary isn't included. Just doing past exams isn't enough to get an A, take the HW seriously. | One of the best professors in the ECE department. Super funny and very nice if you go to his office hours. If you fail this class, drop ECE now because it's stupid easy if you just go to lecture and do the homeworks. He lectures very clearly but does not really follow the book, so don't expect to skip class or you'll struggle. | He's a nice guy! I didn't think he was a good professor until when everything clicked. After things started to make sense, he's great a teaching! Very fair too! | Caggiano was really cool in class and at first you could understand exactly what he was saying. Sometimes he assumed you knew things and it wouldn't make sense until later. Also, the homework were really helpful, up until the end of the semester which started becoming repetitive. If you paid attention in lecture, then you didn't need to study | His exams are basically from the lecture. Don't rely on the textbook to prepare you for the exam properly. He's an awesome professor and tells us funny stories sometimes. Averages for DLD were in the 70's so don't expect a big curve. | Caggiano is a nice guy but he can't teach that well. He runs through topics in class fast and teaches in a dry way. This class is sort of uninteresting so you really have to push yourself to learn and do well. All in all he's not a bad professor he just can't get some topics across. Just work hard & make sure you attend lecture, you should be fine. | Caggiano was great. If you go to his office hours after a exam, and if you try to argue for more points he will pretty much give it to you if you can argue your point. He also makes a point to get to know you if you go to his office hours. Class itself is pretty straightforward, he isn't trying to trick you on exams. | He transitions between topics very poorly. One day you'll be learning about multiplexers, but won't know why. Only at the end of the semester will things start to make sense and come together. Write everything he does down, even if you don't fully understand it. It'll make sense later. | This is my second time with Caggiano, both experiences were great. He's very helpful and friendly during office hours. Watch out for homework, he emails it, so you wont find it on Sakai. | Is not very good at explaining concepts. He assumes students already know logic designs. You must go to his lectures and PAY ATTENTION. The course itself is very basic and simple. If you want to do well go to lectures and PAY ATTENTION!!! | Absoluterly terrible at explaining concepts. He's very knowledgable on how logic is implemented in circuits, just totally garbage at explaining them. The way he lectures, he assumes that you're all graduates of ece going over a crash course on logic design. He gives homework every week, which is fairly simple, just do that and you'll be fine | He really knows his stuff and is much more willing to go into the practical side of things compared to other professors. The exams were fair but the solutions to the HW need to be updated, they contain few errors and the last HW solution had nearly 6-7 problems missing. The project made the material worth learning. Def would recommend this course. | Great Guy, definitely wants his students to succeed, and made the class as challenging as it should be. | Great teacher, makes the class fun and is very clear and goes through examples | Very nice professor,very helpful in answering questions. Doesn't use textbook so must take notes and study them. The downside is the homework solutions are full of mistakes and he won't fix them. It's an easy A if you're willing to try. | Good professor but makes everything easier and there isn't much challenge if you are concerned about learning. Exams are not that hard. you can always get solution manuals for his homework. For all the easiness that I'm talking about, you HAVE TO TAKE HIS NOTES. you are all set. | Great Professor. Best Professor in the ECE department. Does not alwalys use book, so YOU HAVE TO GO TO HIS LECTURE. If you go to his lecture, pay attention, and take good notes you will do fine. | He's a nice, funny guy but not so good as a teacher. Just reads through his notes and writes stuff on the board without really explaining. Had to teach myself most of the course, but ended up with an A. Exams aren't tricky and are easy if you study. TA was helpful. | Great professor. Really knows the subject and teaches it very well. Don't think he curves the class though cause I got an A on the 1st and 3rd midterm a B on the 2nd and A's on everything else in the class and ended up w/ a B+ (unless I totally felt wrong about how I did on the final). He really helps u understand the class and even helps w/ classes he's not teaching. Funny and if u catch a mistake in his notes he laughs about it and says he's not changing them for next semester. Good prof. | I'm only giving a low rating because of how difficult and unorganized this course was. He explains concepts in a difficult way, and regurgitates the same info at office hours. It's very hard if you haven't been exposed to this stuff prior to the course. He is a very nice, funny man and gave a generous curve. I have no respect for the TA's though. | Sure hes a nice guy with a few funny jokes, but he just doesn't know how to properly express material to students. You can't even study from the textbook because you don't know where to start reading. He jumps back and forth and has this mentality that his way is better. His hws are long, and his solutions are filled with errors. He does curve. | I've had this guy for three courses. Everyone complains about him not using the textbook. it's really hard to understand his lectures because he jumps around like crazy and expects you to connect the dots.. he's a nice guy though, just sucks at teaching.oh, and his solutions are always wrong. takes longer to correct them than to study from them | He was pretty good, clear and fair. If he goes over it, it will prob be on the exam | I'm sorry but this professor like most will give you very simple examples in class and when the times comes for exams and homework, the questions are three times as hard. I'm tired of not being shown what I need to know. Every one i speak to also complains,where are all these great comments coming from? TA's weren't helpful aside from recitation | Kind of dry lecturer. Jumps around in the text book alot. Go to recitation (no attendance). I found the TA's much easier to learn from and recitation summarizes what you need to know. Doing the weekly HW also helps you learn the material. | This professor is not as bad as the others are making it. If you study the notes after lecture, what you thought was confusing proves to be quite easy to understand. The homeworks do contain mistakes which doesn't make things easier, but has no affect on learning the material. Easy B. Getting an A is def. do-able. | Caggiano has a great teaching style, very easy to learn from. | THe prof was alright. He taught DE and Analog, just study the notes like crazy, do the hwks as many times as possible for midterms. THere's like 3 midterms and a final. THe final is crazy, after you're through you be flying through the clouds. He just copies notes from binder to board. Go over them and it's an easy B. The TA's were awesome. | Im giving this guy some positive just to offset the negatives. He's not that bad, I HAD a B until finals, when I got sick and couldnt study right. Not too bad, give him a try, he doesnt use the book but his notes are good IMO. | Horrible professor. He doesn't use the text at all. No use even looking through it. He uses his notes which are nothing but some chicken scribble. Not helpful. His hwk are full of mistakes, he won't correct, ur better off using webct to clear up questions and working in groups. His exams are a bit hard, final's really hard. He doescurve, nothelpful | Each lecture he throws endless scribble on the blackboard without adequately explaining underlying concepts. Homework solutions are unclear and sometimes incorrect. There's not much of a chance to apply common reasoning in solving problems. Your best hope is to memorize how to do each particular kind of problem. | No Comments | Get him some ****s and he will give you an A. | Nice guy. Bad professor. He really knows his stuff but doesn't know how to communicate it. He ruins a potentially interesting and important course. Get a book and study on your own if you want to have any idea what's going on. He can't spell either. | He doesn't use the book at all and you really have to pay attention to what he says in lecture so you can have good notes, because that'll be your only way of actually understanding the material,his exams are out of like 15points so there is not MUCH partial credit | I don't mind if professors don't focus on a lot of theory, but this guy NEVER teaches any theory. He explains lectures like ""this leads to this and then do this"" without any reasoning. Wonder why the Rutgers solid state faculty is sh*t in general as compared to software, DSP and communications. | He's not a helpful professor at all. He often helps females first regardless who comes first. Also, his hw is full of erros and doesn't bother to correct them. What a lazy professor. His lectures are useless cuz all u do is to go there to copy the notes down... he doesn't really explain things. | Easy class..if you go to class and take the notes..plus you dont need to buy some expensive book cuz you really dont need it the notes is enough..It would be easier if he would update his solutions | This guy should get tenure, reward teaching style for once. | office hours are a waste of time cuz theres so many people his solutions are incorrect and he never corrected them due to laziness i spent a lot of time trying to figure out whats an error in the solution and what is correct | he is a really nice guy, and has the experience to clarify and give you real world examples. his notes can seem like they are missing pieces, ask him about them... | Not a bad professor, but seems unwilling to help certain people for no apparant reason. Seems to favor female students. Lab assignments are outdated and poorly written, and lab grading is unfair. Cag. doesn't want too many A's so TAs give out B's randomly | Best professor in the Undergrad EE; I'm glad it was him teaching the electronics courses. These are the essentials that EE's need to know, and he really lays it all out there. I learned more Analog, Digital, and Pulse Electronics than most other undergrad | Caggiano is THE man. He has one of the best personalities I've encountered in a professor. He is helpful, and he knows his stuff down COLD. Attending his class is a MUST. You'll regret missing his class, because there is so much to write and take down."
"Petropulu, Athina","Terrible Terrible Terrible Experience. Find another professor or CS version. | The course structure needs work | By far one of the most out-of-touch professors out there. AP is more concerned with doing things in her own way rather than adapting to the students for their success. Abhorrent disregard for students. | One of, if not, THE worst class I've ever taken at this school. Hw was way too long and tedious, taking 6 hours to finish, no open notes or calculator for exams or quizzes, grading was weird on canvas as she set quizzes out of 0, so i didnt know where i stood. She was also out of class more than she was in. Gonna need to teach yourself and pray. | Worst Professor I've ever had. She couldn't teach the material and was very rude and disrespectful towards the students. Never cared to show up to the exams and had the TAs proctor them. This was the first, and hopefully the last time she ever teaches this course. | Worst professor I've had in my 4 years at SOE! quizzes are strictly held at 15 min. final and midterm 1-2 hours( that's after she decided to reduce the time for each at the last minute, and then didn't even show up for either) almost no office hours, she would just tell you to ask the TA's ( who weren't informed half of the time) Awful! | Async class w/ sync quizzes every other week = time conflicts. Result? Made 8 am group for quizzes, but idk why didnt have a small 8 hr window instead. Lectures are okay, but had to watch Youtube for better understanding. 2 group projects but luckily peer evaluations and an email can help fix a grade if group is bad' Long hws almost every week | The group projects is annoying. You're tasked to conduct research and it's graded by your peers. If 1 classmate doesn't do any work, she doesn't care. On a personal level, we had scheduled quizzes (for an async course) and it conflicted with my part-time. I emailed her why I needed to work 30+ hrs and she wouldn't accommodate. | I quite liked Professor Petropulu, she understands the material well and tries to relate it to real-world research and engineering. Biweekly quizzes were pretty easy if you understand the topics and do the homework. The two projects were challenging but well-designed and doable if you have a good group. Syllabus was very clear & she kept by it. | class is so easy if you are doing well in ece, group projects are harder. quizzes are much easier than hw material. Intelligent prof and decent explanations, only complaint is that she should have made the quizzes fully asynchronous | Lectures are very confusing and hard to understand, be prepared to find and watch YouTube videos from someone who can explain the material properly. Would not cut students any slack due to COVID but the students were expected to cut her all the slack in the world. Try to find another professor if possible. | Prof suggests students be professional and submit assignments on time but in reality, she doesn't want to follow the ECE department's announcement: due to covid-19, ""ECE312 is teaching asynchronous"" but she kept continue teaching synchronously and thus, the timing conflicts with other official synchronous classes, quiz time conflicts too. | Compared to the other professors who taught ECE discrete, she's really not that bad (which says something about how bad the other discrete professors are). Her pop quizes are annoying and you never know what to study, but they're not impossible if you know the material. Do practice hw problems and read textbook for the later parts of the course. | Don't get fooled by the low reviews , she was ok in undergrad discrete math, her lectures were straightforward and full of examples, the quizzes were easy . The way she prepared us for the exams is kinda weird, sometimes she won't give practice solutions and sometimes she does however the exams weren't that hard. | Prof. Athina Petropulu is not a bad professor. She tries to make students know and learn something but unfortunately she makes the easy things way more complex. I do not learn too much from her lecture instead from the slides and the youtube. | Asked everyone in class to fill out survey in exchange for posting a practice final exam a day before the actual final. Initially, final project was a choice between deep learning and sparse fourier transform. But, when everyone in class was working on deep learning she made the fourier project mandatory for everyone canceling other project. | The worst professor ever, write on blackboard the whole class. Do not respect student when they need to work with her. | Very smart mam,but not a good teacher plus the Greek accent doesn't help.. Doesn't cut slack in such a tough subject!!Only if you're certain you can do in this course, take it else you're grades will e screwed | Smart professor but bad teacher"
"Burdea, Grigore","Among the best ECE professors I've had at Rutgers, and among the few to have a clear grading criteria established at the beginning of class, allowing students to plan out how they want to approach the rest of the semester on day 1. Prof knew how to teach and run a class. Shame he's retired now and a certain SOMEONE else teaches comp arch instead | As others said there was not enough time for quizzes. The Professor was nice but was pretty out of touch with the student's experiences. There were too many panic attacks at 4 AM stressing over vague language on a HW that was assigned over the weekend to complete in a few days. The textbook wasn't mandatory,but get it was really helpful. Tough A | Impossible to finish quizzes within time, homework is usually very long | Biweekly quizzes were very hard due to strict time limits. Biweekly homework was always just 4 questions but consistently took 6-8 hours to complete. Homework & quiz problems often contained critical errors or otherwise unsolvable problems. Class was downcurved at the end but after complaints this was undone. Prof Burdea was a nice & friendly guy. | Quizzes are insanely hard to finish. He barely gives you any time. Is not in tune with the needs of his students in this challenging time. Did not adapt to online format well. | Grigore Burdea does not care at all. Quizzes are not possible with the time he gives. The thing with him is that he could care less about what you think. When we complained about quiz time, he said that we don't study enough which is far from the truth. I doubt he could finish his own quizzes, and he's been doing it for 40+ years. | By far the better alternative to striki. HW & Quizzes are challenging, start early and memorize well. For exams study the ones from 2 years ago based on your semester, they can be found on coursehero. Also study the slides | I really tried to like this professor , he is a nice guy but he isn't super good at teaching and he isn't organized. He gives quizzes and homework for every chapter and the class is always totally clueless that the averages for these quizzes sometimes reaches the 40s because he doesn't prepare us for them. His exams are the opposite, they are easy | One homework and a quiz per chapter. Labs are dreadful. Final is not cumulative and very similar to practice finals from previous years. lectures a re hard to get through but interesting material. Do the homework, do semi ok on the quizzes youll be fine | Prof. Grigore Burdea is not an easygoing professor. He is a little bit condescending. Still, his lecture is not very useful. His lecture is not well organized. When the idea comes in his mind, he teaches about it, if not he may not mention it at all, which makes the whole lecture misleading. His quiz and homework are way harder than his lecture. | Probably one of the few professors who actually care about teaching their students. | If you have to take him for PEE1 avoid him but if you want to take him for Comp Arch and learn something, he is good at it. The exams for PEE1 were super hard to be an intro course, attendance is mandatory otherwise he will reduce a letter grade. The exams for Comp Arch were comprehensive. Generous Curve | Students are a bit harsh on Professor Burdea. Yes, he is tough, but his class is fair. Attend class, do some extra reading, and study his slides. His slides hold similar problems to his tests, and he also provides you with last year's midterm and final. Burdea also gives 30 points extra credit on his exams which can be a huge help. | I had him for PEE 1 and Comp Arch and I thought he presented the lecture material clearly with lots of examples. I learned a lot in both classes since he covered textbook material well. Make sure you read the textbooks carefully and do as many practice problems as you can. Although he can be strict, he is very fair. | Probably the best comp arch prof in ECE. Required attendance was annoying at 8:40 am. Miss 4 classes and he drops a letter grade. But his exams are fair. And up to 30 points extra credit on midterm and final. Got a 108 on first midterm. He also gives previous years midterm and final which helps. Overall satisfied with my grade in the class. | Having mandatory attendance was annoying because the class was at 8:40 am. He gives a couple pop quizzes. 4 absences and he drops you a letter grade. Quizzes and exams are fair. He gives up to 30 points extra credit on midterm and final. He also gives previous year's midterm and final to study off of which helped a lot. Overall satisfied with grade | His VR class is one of the most enjoyable classes I have had in grad school. Work load is heavy with mid terms, quizzes, finals, labs, lab assignments and projects ,but still learned a lot from the course and enjoyed it thoroughly. | He's got a pretty big ego, and he's sure to remind you about it in class. Attendance is mandatory. He is not a terrible lecturer per-say, but his quizzes and exams are all open ended, and so is the grading it seems. He also treats his TAs like crap, yelling at them in front of the class, so don't be one. | If you don't show up for 3 lectures you lose a letter grade, so when he can't make class because of some stupid reasons, he makes up the lecture on Friday nights at 9pm and makes it a mandatory class that you cant skip. And then there are his tests and quizzes, he makes sure the average is always under a 60 because otherwise its to EZ(in his eyes). | Professor Burdea is the bomb. He may be sort of strict and the class requires a good amount of memorization, but if you actually listen in class, then the quizzes and exams are fairly easy as long as you brush up on the material beforehand. Overall, Burdea is the man. | You won't get much out of lecture other than basic concepts. Study from book and homework and you will most definitely pass. I wouldn't recommend reviewing lecture slides. I'd rate 1/5 but he gets 2/5 because he looks like Gman from half life. | Be ready for half of the time in class listening to him complaining about the students | Burdea was a terrible professor and he spoke in a monotone voice all the time. I scored 20 points above the average on each exam and still got a B. He was super hard and when he asked for feedback, he didn't appreciate that is was negative. He is strict on attendance and pop quizzes. If you can get another professor, do so! | Here's what I experienced from principles 1 1) He didn't cover all the material for the first exam, catching many students off guard. 2) He throws pop quizzes in lecture. 3) I received an A in the class but only due to sitting down and teaching myself everything, lecture was horrible but mandatory due to quizzes. 4) He had an attendance sheet | To be honest, I can't really say I learned anything from his class. I feel like he understands the material but has no idea how to teach it. When he was compared to the other PEE I lecturer (whom my friends which have him are doing well with), he called them an ""easy grader,"" rather than admitting to his own faults. | The material for Discrete is very easy since the material is previously covered in Probability or DLD. The tests are straightforward. The extra credit questions on the test are really just regular questions since he grades on a bell curve. | He is condescending and doesn't care about his students at all | I took PEE1 and comp arch with him. Pretty good guy, just PEE1 had a couple of twists that, if you were really good, you would be able to manage. Honestly, a lot of the students who had problems probably didn't take it seriously; I took max credits and got both A's. | You have to read from the slides and the book class to class if possible. Quizzes are hard but the exams have some extra credits and the average on the midterm and final was 77 | Attendance is mandatory. Exams are tough but truly test your understanding of the concepts. Exams are straight forward as you know exactly what to expect. Quizzes are challenging as well. Diagrams/graphs from his slides are usually on a quiz/exam. | Slides were useless, exams were not only extremely confusing but unlike any of the material seen before in the class. Learning from the book is absolutely mandatory, I tried learning from slides/lecture and it was absolutely useless. Class average was insanely low, hard homeworks which usually didn't make sense were due the day of exams... bad prof | For VR- Dont know why every1 else has been complaining about him. He isnt that hard nor arrogant as people say. They probably never paid attention nor went to class. Review/memorize class slides & the quizzes/exams wont be difficult. Only problem is that tests tend to be longer than time permits. It helps to be familiar with writing code for labs. | Burdea is pretentious, has a high ego, and often treats students like dirt. His Comp Arch tries to fit too much information into one semester and the Powerpoint lectures not only do it no justice but are difficult to follow. Despite what Burdea says, this course is mostly memorization and too often the slides are insufficient. Buy the text book. | He just isn't realistic. The things he expects are too much. Most people here are seeing this material for the first time, and they are trying to learn the basics. He expects the students to be able to APPLY the material. It's almost like expecting someone to know how to use a calculator when they don't even know any math to begin with. | Burdea is an arrogant, bad teacher, who can't even write understandable test questions. Archeology should be a prerequisite so you can decipher them. -F | Seriously, he gave a quiz the day before thanksgiving and announced the date only a week in advance.I showed the professor a plane ticket that had me leaving NJ the day before and he wouldn't give me a makeup quiz. I'd rather take a 0 on a quiz than miss my flight and be stuck in NJ.If it were an exam worth much more, I would complain to the dean. | HE IS ARROGANT- he's unhelpful, 'holy than thou', pompous, not understanding, not caring etc. He knows what he's teaching (except 'Pier to Pier' networking...) but he shouldn't be allowed to teach students. | To this day, the following words echo in my head. -----Burdea: (to student talking) could you please stop talking?-----Student: Oh, im sorry.-----Burdea Oh, you're not sorry yet, don't make me make you sorry.-----WOW! he really said that! (comparch, spring 04) | very rude...disrespectful to students...stupid exams..(questions dont make any sense)...tests ur memorizing capacity than ur understanding | One word sums up this guys personality - arrogant. He has a negative attitude toward a students success. He wonders we lecture attendance decreased, maybe if he didn't ridicule students in lecture for not knowing something people would attend. | i hated him with all my life. my first grade under B+ was with him, which was a C+. dnt take his class. | Hard exams. Labs are pretty easy. Burdea isn't a helpful professor. | his exams are pretty hard, and he wants you to memorize alot of stuff. best quote. (someone was talking in class, burdea got mad, the kid talking apologized) ""im sorry professor"" to which burdea replied: ""youre not sorry yet, don't make me make you sorry"" haha | the ego problem's true, he never talks to you... | Horrible lecture, he tests you more on whether you can remember the name of a company or redraw a picture from his notes then the actual material. The lab is good but that is because the TA's teach it. | Burdea is an okay professor. He is a little laid back and he is quiute competent. However, he DEFINITELY has an ego problem. He thinks he's the best (probably because he pulls in funding for VR) and he doesn't reply to email."
"Orfanidis, Sophocles","Having your entire grade determined by 3 online exams is very nerve racking, but they were all pretty easy which made life much easier. His lectures are incredibly useless and boring, but the material is easily learned on your own via the slides and labs. I think by the second week the amount of people in the lecture shrunk from 200+ to maybe 20. | Great Professor. Just do the reviews. | Really nice professor. Just study the review exams and you'll be set. | I had him for both DLD and LSS. his lectures were difficult to understand and can be a bit slow, however if you do his review guides and practice problems they are pretty much a repeat of the tests & quizzes, as long as you put the time in and ask him the write things you'll do good in the class. | He is a really nice guy. He is super patient and super knowledgeable. However, he is not a good professor. His lecture is useless and tedious. He makes the easy concept becomes too complex for students to handle. I will not recommend you to take his class again. | He is a very nice person both inside and outside of class. Homework isn't mandatory and does VERY little to nothing to help you in class. You HAVE to do all the set questions he posts on Sakai to pass the class with a good grade. Exam and final questions are almost identical to those in the sets. HW questions are asked on recitation quizzes. | Class is pretty easy. No mandatory homework or attendance. Grade is based off midterm and final only so don't mess up on those. Go to recitation/lab. You will learn more there than anywhere else if you pay attention. Lectures kind of useless but supplements recitation. Professor is very chill but doesn't lecture very well. | The lectures are tedious and boring. He covers many topics. Textbook is useless. Study the materials he gives you when exam come (problems set) and you will pass. | Pointless class and horrible lecturer. The class you must learn on your own or through friends. Anyone can stand there and upload slides and read them. There is no point , just work hard because you're not learning anything from him. | The lectures are just so pointless. This is a class you have to teach yourself so you have to do the weekly recitations yourself with the powerpoints to keep up. I notice the people who fail are usually the ones who always copied their homework. Just practice the sample exam and keep up to date with the recitation and you'll pass easily. | Lecturer is beyond useless. I have absolutely no coding experience, but the class was a breeze. People who say they hate the class are usually not good at it. Lecture not mand but recitation is mand, MAKE FRIENDS to do recitations together and read power points. Exams are super easy. I studied 3 hours before each exams, got 95+ on all of them. | His lectures do not help you have to study on your own | extremely hard if you know nothing about coding. you just gotta teach yourself but make sure to go to lecture cuz he might take attendance and that will count as extra credit. you just don't knew when he will take it. I never went to extra help but i heard he gives good feedback. Make sure to prepare yourself and you just gotta practice on your own | The professor himself said that he puts himself to sleep when he lectures, but he does explain things very clearly if you ask him in person. You don't need to go to class, but he sometimes goes over material that isn't covered elsewhere and also gives random attendance E.C. Definitely do the optional homework, tests are based on it. | Most of the people giving bad reviews are Idiots. Honestly with the right amount of work each week you can easily get at least a B. You must realize this is a coding class. The only and best way to learn is to learn on your own. I recommend getting the textbook and to practice | Spectacularly bad lecturer, probably one of the worst available at Rutgers. You will learn matlab by yourself and from your friends, and this man will not help you a single bit. Don't waste your time going to lectures; attendance barely factors into the grade. | He just talks on forever. And assumes we know what he's talking about. And he doesn't pause in class to give us time to understand either. Plus his voice is monotone and makes you fall asleep | he is very helpful and clear explanation when i go to see him at his office hour. however, he is very unclear, not helpful, teach way too fast at the lecture. | He gives really boring lectures but they are not mandatory. However, he does take attendance 3 times a semester for extra credit. The first exam is easy and then it gets harder and harder. Your last final will not be during finals week. Also, read the book it helps and do the recitations. | Totally useless teaching method. I guess it's not really his fault because of the class size. Lecture is pointless and a total waste of time. Make sure to just practice matlab in the computer labs whenever you have free time. You kind of end up just teaching yourself. Read the textbook it's very helpful. | Boring mandatory lectures, but class is trivial if you have programming experience. If you don't, you'd best take the time to read the text, and don't fall behind. | if you stay on top of your work you will be find but as the semester goes along it gets really tough. get ready for the ride | His lecture notes are helpful, but his homeworks and recitation assignments are ridiculous. You spend more time trying to understand the problems than actually doing them. That combined with limited office hours made this class difficult. | He made me forget that professors are actually supposed to teach. But so has every other professor at RU. His accent is so thick you can barely understand him, and his lectures only confuse things even more. The only redeeming qualities are that he will answer emails asking for help in homeworks and recitations, and give extra credit for showingup | Worst professor I have ever had. Tough to follow in lecture. However he posts his slides online and they are useful. So basically you have to teach yourself the language with minimal help. Exams are 3-4 questions so you can easily bomb them | His lectures are difficult to follow, but he posts the slides online. The recitation problem set is mandatory (and attendance for recitations is mandatory, but thankfully you can skip lectures). His teaching style leaves a lot to be desired, so taking this class means learning on your own. Apart from that it's not a extraordinarily difficult class. | The class isn't bad ,but he is horrible. Go though the homework and look through the exit book and you'll be fine. Attendance gives you extra points s it's good to go. But he is one terrible professor who cannot teach well at all | He made the class harder than it should have been. He treated us all like experts at MATLAB even though some of the class (including me) never programmed before. He gives you a lot of resources to study from and does help you if you ask him a question. The first exam is easy, but the second exam and the final are hard. Good luck with this class. | I never went to his lectures, and I did fine with the class. Attend recitation, and do the work and you'll be set. He does answer any and ever email in a very timely fashion, most of the time I got a reply with the right code within five minutes. From what I've heard the lecture is as bad as people say, but just email him and you'll get it. | Horrible teacher. He advertised matlab rather than teaching it. | Don't listen to any of the rankings before 2012-ish, he taught a different subject back then. In Matlab currently, he mumbles, barely speaks proper English, and runs on about nothing. If you think you're about to learn, he'll say what he just said was wrong anyway. Overcomplicated sentences. Awful explanations of logic. Terrible. | He doesnt require you to do hw anymore but he recitation work is a must! Depending on the TA you have, you wont know how you do on the recitations unless they post grades online. His first exam was do able if you use the prac test posted, 2nd exam was hard and final is death because its everything takes random attendance, and hope for a high curve! | His super power is to put the lecture hall to sleep. He just reads of his power point and is extremely boring so lecture was basically nap time. First exam was extremely easy, and 2nd exam was hard and then you realize that you actually have to spend 10hours(not exaggerating) a week doing the homework to do good on the final. | He is soooo hot!!!!!! | One of the worst lectures I've taken at Rutgers, He simply reads from the slides without really explaining what it is or why it's like that. On top of that he mumbles, making for a very easy nap session. The homework took hours and the book barely helped. | Horrible teacher. His exams include material that you learn AFTER the exam. It's like putting an integral on an Alg II Exam | Horrible instructor. One of the worst I have ever had. Presents material in a way that is extremely difficult to understand and digest. His homework assignments took me an average of 4 hours a week. absolutely terrible. Avoid if you can. | There is no point in showing up to class except for the fact that attendance is taken. He just reads from the power points that we can access online. Very boring lecture. | Worst teacher I've ever had. Not helpful at all, attendance is mandatory, didn't even return exams after checking them so we had no idea where we had gone wrong | I already know programming professionally, he just bores me to sleep and I still do his exam/homework in a heartbeat, great professor! | He is not very helpful. You fall asleep during his lectures. Even upperclassmen can't help you with your homework. | Banned use of laptops during lecture. Takes random attendance. Asked us to write code to modify data in a file without providing the associated file on an exam. Weekly Homework takes a few hours, and if you miss one, you don't get 0/10 - you get -1/10. He knows his stuff and his powerpoints are consistent and helpful on the homework. | Had him for intro MATLAB. After the first lecture, I could see it was pointless to attend anymore because he was basically reading off his powerpoints (which may as well have come from book). However, he is super helpful in office hours/email. He writes all those homework problems himself and they're very interesting/well crafted! A good professor. | Teaches as if every student already knows everything there needs to know about matlab beforehand. Though he is nice and patient when asking privately, he is still understand in lectures as he says ""this does this, this does that"". Really, only the colorful graphs at the end of the lectures are the only fun things that you see. | Hard to understand his lectures. Almost as if he expects us to know Matlab professionally already. Assignments are too difficult and require too much time. | This guy knows the subject material well, but he is not the best teacher. This course was both a graduate/undergraduate level course. He teaches mostly abstract theory and is hard to follow. He assigns 30-60 hrs of work per week. Including difficult labs. You need to know MatLab programming and partial differential equations for this course. | Great teacher, gives very clear examples, exam questions are taken right from class. takes notes and pay attention and you'll get an A. very helpful and interesting. | Amazing guy. One of the best Professors I have seen. You just cannot match his commitment to work. He's more committed to teaching than all of us put together are towards studying. | Most committed professor I have seen | Amazing Professor.. Great teaching..very helpful. moderately tough exams, but his teaching makes it easy | He's a good teacher and nice guy. | Very smart guy. Good teacher but goes too fast. Flexible on deadlines. Book is excellent. Grades fairly - be sure to put something down for every problem - he gives a lot of partial credit. Matlab problems take a lot of time - 15 to 30 hrs/lab with writeup. Need a prior knowledge of z transforms and MatLab before this graduate level DSF course. | Very good professor to have in the graduate program. He is helpful and gives his book online for free. | This class is easssy. Do all the hw's and old exams. Everything is similar to his old stuff. No need to go to lecture, although he is a good teacher. Only thing that sucks is no curve, but don't really need it. | Great teacher. Willing to help out anyone who asks. Do the homework, you get an A in the course. | This profesor is helpful if you go see in office hours or go to his class you would learn everything just from his notes. | He is the most dedicated professor into teaching | One of the best professors I have had in my lifetime. knows his stuff. electronic book great. can tell he spent alot of time developing homework assignments and questions. If you really want to understand wave phenomena with someone who knows how to explain the mathematics - take him! Excellent | great professor...........one of the best profs in my life.........also a great person......u can hardly find such ppl in this world now........master in his subjects.....knows his stuff.... | Probably the best teacher I ever had. He makes very difficult material seem easy. He inspired me to go on for my Ph.D. Nice guy, too."
"Sarwate, Anand","Great professor who teaches well and cares about his students. Matlab assignments were great and help teach the material without being insanely difficult. Main advice is to keep up with the material and study ahead of time, it can be kinda easy to slip behind the material. An A is reasonable to achieve with enough effort, and you will learn a lot. | Hes a great guy, but this class was REALLY badly structured. Srsly, a quiz, a project and a hw packet all do within 4 days of eachother? Biweekly quizzes with a retake offered a week after, but those are needed since we're basically on our own for the first on. If you can find an alternative, for the love of God, take that instead of this. | He's the best! | Great lectures and very helpful when you have questions. The final exam offers a solid review of the course materials, which was a very rewarding experience. | Quizzes you on all the things he didn't teach instead of what he taught you?? | LSS is not easy and moves at a fast pace. However, he does care. That being said, the online format is really not good for learning. | The most organized professor in Rutgers , other professors should fellow his teaching and notes organization methods. His lectures are fast but clear and all concepts are well explained. The homeworks are kinda annoying especially the matlab problems but he does provide some help on piazza. His exams are balanced ; not hard not easy. | Professor Sarwate shows that he cares about LSS but that doesn't mean he cares about your GPA..., be ready to pull your hair out doing homework that isn't mirrored on the exams. MATLAB sections of the HW are brutal. Exams are terrible but the good thing is that averages are always low so the curve is almost always fat. Just try and get the average. | Sarwate is probably one of the best professors in the ECE department but LSS is not a course for him. He is very organized, he puts all his energy on this class but his method of teaching this class is not the best. The material for this class is hard so be ready to study hours. His exams are super long. Good Luck... One more thing, He curves! | No matter what anyone says, he's the best. | Sarwate is one of the best lecturers in the ECE department. Be prepared for lots of homework but it will definitely help you understand the material. He takes effort to keep his notes organized and help students who are struggling. | He's a great guy, tries really hard to be helpful. I love the effort he puts into the class, especially the fact that he LaTeX's everything (homework, notes, homework solutions, quizzes, etc) , not many professors would go out of their way to do that. Unfortunately heavy amounts of homework and the MATLAB simulations (part of the homework). | Although his exams were challenging (including a 40 paged Midterm II), Sarwate demonstrated that he was truly one of the most organized professors in the department. The way he organizes his lecture notes and makes resources available to you are unlike any other ECE professor who even care at all. Would take again, but after some experience. | He's honestly a very fair professor. This class is very difficult, but he cares and tries to do his best to make the material clear to understand. A lot of people complained in the class, but the exams were straightforward if you put in the time to understand and didn't just copy all of your homeworks. I would definitely take him again. | Seemed like a nice person at first,but will then do everything in his power to make the class hell. Material is difficult to begin with and his confusing lectures don't make it any easier. He expects you to do everything he failed to do on the board during the exam. Questions about the exam results? Don't bother not his problem. Avoid at all costs."
"Javanmard, Mehdi","Lectures are on the board only, nothing is accessible after class, the book is also very different so if you have to miss a class you have to rely on a classmates notes/fall behind. Not enough quality practice material was given out to practice for exams which hurts studying. Syllabus was changed last minute and many people were given a lower grade | Unclear grading criteria, even with an 87, I ended up with a B. Make it make sense! Do not take this professor, he seems nice but he actually does not care about the exams he gives to the students or the material taught in class. | What even is the point of having a textbook if you're not going to follow it? Not enough resources provided. | I think his lectures aren't too bad but oh man the guy is kinda hard to work with. Never responds to emails and makes the rules as he goes. Brought me down a full letter grade. | Very strange professor, who could not care less about students, material, or the grades anyone got. Notes have typos and exams are difficult and often beyond the scope of the course. Downcurved grades on transcript with no rubric. Avoid this professor and his TA Tianyi Chai at all costs. Both could use classes on teaching, organization & empathy. | He is nice and very understanding. The Course could be difficult but he chose to teach slow to make sure everyone knows the material. | Spends the first half of the semester doing basic electronics, and then rushes through diodes and transistors. Grading scheme is eh, with 80% of the grade being exams. He tries to trick everyone into thinking there's no curve, when there was a pretty decent one (70 was a B). But, he's a very nice guy, go to his office hours and he'll help you out. | [For the lab (ECE363)] Terrible. Labs are always ahead of his lectures. He says ""in the real world, you won't always know the material,"" but as if biweekly labs are like the real world. Lectures are meant to help, THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR. He only begins lectures about the lab material after the lab is due, so you won't even know if your work is right. | He was one of the few professors who I think handled the online format well. He did his best to make the lecture similar to how they would have been in person, did a lot of examples. He did downcurve at the end tho, but can't really blame him because if he didnt like half the class would just get A's and that would just inflate the grades too much. | He ran this online class like a diploma mill: give dead-easy exams throughout the semester, then apply a down-curve at the end. He did not seem comfortable with the subject matter too: the questions he gave were pointless declensions of a very basic concept and he makes lots of grading mistakes, some of which he has yet to fix. | Probably the best professor I have had in the ECE department so far. He really did a good job with the online format. I would definitely take a class with him again. | So rude and pretentious, constantly interrupting students. Today was our final and I've yet to see a grade from this class. Good luck submitting an assignment without redoing it since nothing is ever good enough. Lectures are a mess, just a combo of slides from other universities. I did ru ece for both grad & undergrad, if you see him run | Very good professor. He puts a lot of effort into making his lectures understandable. He gives very fair exams as well. They are challenging, but doable. He is also a nice guy if you go to his office hours. Just go to lecture, take good notes, do a few hw problems (don't have to do all of them) do his reviews, and you should pass with no problems. | The easiest and slowest professor in the ece department, he explains stuff in detail and keeps repeating import concepts all the time especially in his pop quizzes which kinda waste time, He could've taught us more stuff from the textbook. That's his only con. His exams are straightforward , the 2nd midterm was the easiest exam I took in rutgers. | He really went the extra mile to make sure you understood everything from the ground up, even if it meant repeating himself. There were also countless extra credit opportunities when I took it last semester, so there was no excuse not to do well. I got a D in Lu's class, but I ended up with 101% and a crystal clear understanding second time around. | Most ece professor is bad at lecturing and some of them have a really bad attitude to their students. But this professor is really a good professor who cares about his students and he tries his best to teach and let us learn something. Good yet not complete, his lecture is a little bit confusing sometimes, but pros win cons. Highly recommended! | Challenging class but he makes it bearable. Such a kindhearted intelligent individual. I didn't think I deserved to pass, but I did my best and he let me go to PEE2. Be sure to understand the theory and applications. Master the HW problems and read the text book. | Best professor in the ECE department that I've come across so far. The second after him would be Caggiano. This man is very clear in his explanations. He will help you breeze through PEE1 and any other class you are fortunate enough to have him for. Hope this helps."
Sehajpal Sumati,"Sumati is good but her lecture is awfuel. It seems she expect everyone in her class study 30+ hours per week for this course. And she keep making mistakes in formula and homeworks. Her exams will sometimes have problem outside the range she claimed. If her courses are not needed to graduate I would not take any of her course. | I have seen some negative ratings for Professor Sehajpal lately but I can't understand why. She provides general video lectures plus a set of prewritten slides so you can fill them in while watching her videos. She also has videos that are organized by topic and some answers to student questions. She also answers emailed questions quickly. | Good teacher. She is teaching the class online and provides general video lectures plus a set of prewritten lecture slides so you can fill them in while watching her videos. She also has lectures that are organized by topic and some that are answers to student questions. I'm not saying she is easy but she is fair and she knows the material. | She only has 1 office hour a week, does not follow the textbook, and if you ask for clarification or additional resources/ problems to help you better understand the material, she just tells you to look at her lectures. Our class average is somewhere around 45-55, but she keeps saying there will be a curve. Avoid if you can, good luck if you cant! | Sumati is nice, but her ability to convey difficult concepts is lacking. She rushes through the material, doesnt give nearly enough time for tests. She doesnt provide clear explanations for homework questions( in which there is frequently errors) and will throw up material on quizzes/tests that she barely went over. Avoid her if you can. | Considering I've had A's in most of my ece classes i've never struggled with a class so much. Tests and quizzes are nothing close to the hw and are beyond difficult. She goes through important topics very fast and never clarifies them well. Expect to study at least 30 hours a week to get even 60s on quizzes. If you have to take this class goodluck. | I did not like her lecture style. You are pretty much forced to follow a template with notes. The way the lecture is formatted is also a bit disorienting. My most common question in lec is what and why are we doing something, which should be visually expressed better. Material is super easy once understood. HW often had inaccuracy in solutions. | Lectures can be overwhelming. However, the way she teaches requires you to review every week in a consistent matter and ask questions/clarifications. Doing so, the next lectures will be that much more easier to understand. This isn't the normal class where you can study last two weeks before the exam. It's just not possible. Don't do it. | Do not take expect you have to or you are insane. All of lectures, quizzes and exams are copied from other universities. And changed some values to make the problems nonsense. Really hard final with mean 50. Thats not students' problem. | Professor Sumati is a good professor , her notes are actually very organized but the problem is that she doesn't upload them online , so you have to attend class to get notes or maybe get them from a friend. Her exams aren't hard but she doesn't provide enough practice so try to do homework problems by yourself even if she doesn't require that. | Not sure which class the previous reviewer took but professor Sehajpal is very well organized. She provides nicely organized pre-lecture slides that you can use to fill in during the lectures. She gives review sessions before midterm 1 and final. Her exams are fair and if you've studied, you can surely do well. | totally disorgainzed slides and lecture. the thing is not that hard but she somewhat magically can change it into complicated staff. you can not follow her logic in the lecture, please avoid her unless you have strong related background. | Took her for EEE and had a pretty good experience. She explained things really well in class and uploaded slides with her notes for you to review. If you had a question she would be more than happy to go back and explain. Quizzes and tests were pretty fair. Very nice professor and cared about her students! | Her notes are very confusing and difficult to comprehend. She also goes through concepts way too fast. Material really isn't that hard, it's just the way she teaches that makes it so. If you are good at blindly writing stuff down and then understanding what the notes mean later, then her teaching style suits you. | Her class is totally disorganized and she clearly knows what the things are but she fails on teaching. I would rather read my book than taking her class. Besides, she makes the class become a note-copying class., totally meaningless for learning. | She uses the tough-love approach and it kept me honest. If you don't know your stuff in class, you will get intellectually grilled. To study for exams, understanding lecture notes is paramount. Class is hard, but very doable and there's a big fat curve. For reference, I took ED twice and I still managed to ace DE on the first try. Anyone can do it. | If you are self-study guy, DON'T take her classes. Homework is unhelpful because exam is totally different than homework. Her slides will not post online so you must attend lecture. Major of homework problems are not in exam. Some tricky parts she spent about 20min on class will be in exam. Totally confused to prepare exam. Don't take her class. | Dont take her class if you want even a little fun in your life along with study. She assumes that students are only having her class not having any other courses and expects unbelievable work from us. Moreover,she goes way too fast in lectures its almost impossible to grasp that much fast,She has stopped giving lectures slides with stupid reason | Although Sumati did reinforce topics that were taught during lectures she often singled out students and didn't review topics that would be on the quizzes. She was a horrific grader, expecting problems to be done ""her way""& would get offended if students were to laugh or have fun in class, so make sure you never talk, giggle, or smile in her class. | Had for as a Calculus 135 TA and she was amazing. My professor during lecture was hard to understand, but Sumati did an amazing job teaching the material. She did problems that were exactly like the quiz after recitation so it was a guarantee 100%. Great TA and in many cases better than the actual professor. Takes pride in what she teaches. | The best lab instructor we have had in the ECE department! She knows how to use every test instrument in the lab and she explains them to the students. When the experiments don't work she can quickly find and explain the problem. Her grading is very fair, she is always available during her office hours, and she carefully grades the lab reports."
McGarvey John,"Simply amazing, I've never seen a professor who goes above and beyond for his students like he does. | Professor McGarvey should be the example that all other ECE professors strive to be. This man explains things thoroughly and thanks to his numerous years working in industry he can relate examples to real world applications. His grading scheme is extremely fair especially thanks to the numerous projects. BY FAR THE BEST ECE PROFESSOR. | Easily one of the best professors I've had, He gives extensions when he sees that the class is behind and provide extra video lectures to make sure you understand the material. | Probably one of the best professors I have had so far. He actually cared about us doing well and was willing to give as much help as we needed. He always answered as many questions as he could. He was a little slower as to his older age, but other than that he was funny and lectures were fine. He was easy to contact and discuss topics with. | Good lectures with supplementary tools on canvas."
"Gajic, Zoran","He is tough to understand at first but you get used to his accent. His lectures can be theory/proof heavy at times but you don't have to worry about them for the tests. Hw is optional but is necessary to understand in order to do good on the tests. Tests closely resemble the hw. Projects are straight forward. Helpful office hours. | He is a good professor , helpful . | Nice professor. His exams were very straightforward; if you could do the homework problems without constantly checking solutions, then you'll do fine. There's always one exam question that sort of goes outside the homework problems but they're not hard. It tests your understanding of the material, and sometimes they're easier than HW itself. | It would be a crime not to take this professor at your time at Rutgers. Very nice professor, shows real world examples, and no curve balls. Very fair grade scale, just make sure you ace both midterm exams. No final. I would take him again for my graduate level courses. | OMG! Gajic is the MAN!!! Projects are mad fun and he is mad helpful!! Easy B! A with some kinda effort! Gives out quiz and exam questions!!! Drop out of college if you can't get a B in this class! | If you can understand him, all he does is repeat stuff he wrote in his book. I can read the book on my own - if I wanted it to be repeated to me, I'd ask someone to read it aloud. Going to lecture was a waste of time. | Gajic is the man. Easy class. You can bring anything to the exams, hw solutions, notes, textbooks. Don't have to go to class cause he teaches right out of the book which he wrote. Just make sure you do all the assigned problems and practice exams. Problems are VERY similar to assigned problems. One of the easiest class you will take as ece. | very nice person..helpful during office hours...exams are too easy...exactly like the practice exams...very easy class | extremely mathematical class. writes everything down. massive HW & doesn't collect it so on your own. exams similar, not exact, HW. half of class usually drops out. will not pass you if grade below 45. nice guy but you have to do the work. | Way too theoretical... | he is the worst professor I have ever seen | His exams are exact questions like the homework, do all the hwk problem 4 times and your set for the exam. Going to his office hr does help a lot. His exams are same format as past. OVerall an easy course the first midterms is the hardest, the secong midterm and final are easy. | TAKE HIM OR HIS WIFE WHENEVER YOU CAN!! | Pretty easy guy...exams are basically old exams with some changed values...not bad at all for engineering"
"Pompili, Dario","Class was a mix of undergrad and post-grad students with no discernible differences in grading criteria. A lot of time is dedicated to doing a group project based on the professors research material, which is loosely tied to the course material. I would not recommend anyone take the class to get a basic understanding in wireless communications. | Often unprepared for lectures, and the class structure in its entirety was poor. All of the material would be read off slides, with most of the material learned not even being on the exams. The midterm exam and the final were both online which resulted in a higher average grade. This caused the class to have a downcurve overall (>90 is B+). | This class is a waste of time because of the professor. Grading is just ridiculous avoid any class taught by him. | If possible take the CS version of discrete or at least a better professor. Even without covid-19 he wasn't that great and pretty much just read off slides. | Lectures are not great: he expects us to already be familiar with what hes talking about when going over slides. Also course as a whole was ran poorly. Online exams were textbook questions so people just googled the answer. He surprised us with a ""curve"" at the end (of course after people submit his SIRS). 85 is a C. | We only covered like half of the syllabus. We covered probability & combinatorics which is not useful (we already had a prob class). Professor is very smart & knowledgeable, but bad at teaching and misinterprets everything. He also only reads from the slide. Online transition was met with bad quality exams and harsh downcurve grading. | Did my semester and planned things out to get above a 90. Got slightly above 90. Above 90 is an A, right? Apparently not, it was a B+, and we were only told the cutoffs after the final. Also, the cutoffs were determined by our performance relative to others, which is insensitive to do given the pandemic and the rampant cheating(exams not proctored) | did fine on homework, messed up exams, in his class a 72 D | He is heartless and obsessed with fitting the class grades into a bell curve when it is absolutely unnecessary making an 85 a C+. Does not teach, gives pop quizzes, does not care about students and is irrational. This is the worst and most useless class i have ever taken. | Worst Professor in the ECE department. He reads math slides, never ever touched a board. He gives pop quizzes so you're forced to attend the lectures which are basically useless. 85 in this class is a C+. Very cold and doesn't care bout the people, doesn't want to email him. Even the H.W. solution, his TAs has it posted as screenshot from slader. | This professor's grading scheme is UNREAL, this review is being written for the semester with the coronavirus regulations. He did NOTHING to show his support. There was no partial credit on the midterm exam and he tested us with MULTIPLE CHOICE on a math course, there is not much to say other than SKIP this man and any other course he teaches. | I'm going to try to be professional, but I'll say what's on my mind. This is the worst professor I've ever had in my undergraduate time. People like him don't deserve to teach kindergarten and not college students. He ""curved"" the entire class and made 85 be the avg and that being said it's a C+��. | Amongst everyone hating Pompili, I have given him the benefit of the doubt throughout the semester. But the day before grades are posted, he put a down curve. 85 avg for a C+. One of the only classes I was hopeful for this semester and now it's gone to sh**. & yes he just reads slides, hw is long and pop quizzes. | HW solutions are literally copy-paste online. HW was given the highest weight. Exams (online due to corona) same. Final had errors that refused to be acknowledged. Expect a heavy downcurve and grading that heavily penalizes non-cheaters. | never take him again. He made discrete math a nightmare. Prepare for self-study if u cant aviod him. | Definitely a bad professor. You will learn nothing in his class. Yeah, so baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad. | DO NOT CHOOSE HIS COURSE! That is hard and tough, and he has lots of wired requirements!!! | Had him for wireless. Very smart guy. But too into his research. Material was very difficult. He had no notes or slides, just read straight out of the textbook. Impossible to follow or comprehend. And then the research project. We had to read an insane amount of research papers nobody could understand. In an undergrad course. Avoid him if you can. | He's not good. His lectures are pretty useless. He just reads from the publisher's slides. You will be teaching yourself the entire course on your own. Avoid this professor. | During lecture, he only reads from slides that are given by the publisher of the textbook. If you ask him a question, he tends to seemingly purposefully misinterpret the question and not answer it. He gives pop quizzes in lecture though, so going to lecture (although a waste of time) is pretty much mandatory. Avoid Pompili if possible horrible prof | Really bad professor, only read the slides and never did any problems on the blackboard, also, he didn't post the slides and let you read the textbook. I paid him for reading the slides | This guy really sucks, he only talk about his not known accomplishments. Who cares, I pay money to learn not to hear an Italian with large ego. Avoid him if you can. | Had him for comp arch and DSP. He does have a ton of slides and it hurts your eyes to study from them for long periods of time. His exams aren't hard, and he will let you bring a cheat sheet. Make sure you visit TAs, they will give you helpful info. He doesn't curve so you have to do well. Only 10 point bonus quiz that is added to final score. | He is an ok professor. i had him for comp arch and dsp..he uses slides all day every day.. hardly uses the board...almost 50% class falls asleep during lecture and out of the rest, lot of ppl dont even show up to class..his exams are pretty hard..he cant teach properly..hard to understand what he is trying to teach..gotta learn it yourself"
"Trappe, Wade","Trappe is by far THE BEST prof in the ECE dept, now that hes the director, hell bring in the best of the best! He really, really seems to get the students and advocates for us all to succeed, I had him 3 times, if you get the opportunity to take one of his classes, take it, hell inspire you to be better than you ever thought you could be! | Professor Trappe is THE BEST prof in ECE and in the entire Engineering Department! Hoping with his promotion to Director he can bring in better professors into ECE - Rutgers students deserve it and if anyone can do it, he can. Hes hilarious, and an absolute advocate for the students, have had him twice so far, if you get a chance, take him! | He is the only professor in the ECE departments that understands what's the point of taking a class as an elective. Super knowledgeable, gives you good information of real world problems. The whole class is graded by few thing and its towards the end. Just do the Group Presentation and fill out the surveys. | He tells you whats going to be on the exams, and theyre really short exams (can be done in like 40 minutes). His homework is hard but its fine cause he doesn't use problems from the book, he creates his own for the exam. He's more into theory then problem solving so no circuit analysis is taught in his class. His curve at the end is banging. | Decent lecturer who goes way too slowly through relatively easy material. Homework is much harder than the quizes and exams, but beware ""tricks"" on the exams. | hezz a decent professor. Way better than the other ECE dept proffs. His exams are not that hard. However, he likes to have a trick or two in his exams which will separate the A students from the B students. so if you get the trick than you will get the most credit. Helps you anytime if you need help.. curves decent too if the clsss avg is low.. | The best ECE Professor. | He is a good professor. Exams are well planned ! | He is a good professor. Exams are well planned ! | Great Proffessor, decent curve, with a little work you can get an A. | He is a really nice teacher. Teaches extremely well. Pretty laid back. This particular course is more theoretical. So you have to know stuff inside out to get an A. But a B or a B+ isn't hard to get. One of the best teachers you will have at Rutgers. Exams are challenging but good curve. i think he makes up his own questions which is pretty smart. | Alright I'm probably the first commenting bad about this dude, too much theory in his course; i need more practice, Talking in depth about a particular problem doesnt necessary solve it. And you don't put proofs on the board that are not reliable (which can be false) thats misdirection right there. Anyway did I studied for this Class. Yes. Abstract | Great guy, very interesting class. He is not there to fail you. He recognizes that the class is an elective and wants you to do well, though not be overburdened. Put the effort in and you will get an A. And it'll be fun along the way. I'd take the class again if I could. | Good professor, pretty laid back...have to relatively keep up, but very interesting class...and if you are willing to put in effort, you'll get the A. | great teacher, great guy....one of the best classes i tool at rutgers...has in depth knowledge of his subject.....extremely helpful too.... | Great teacher. One of the best classes I've had at Rutgers. The projects are amazing and the exams aren't too bad but you have to go to class and take notes."
"Chen, Yingying","Great professor! Class consisted of weekly quizzes, exams, weekly group discussions, a research project, and in-class worksheets/activities. Some of the content could be boring and a little confusing, but Dr. Chen broke it down well and made it interesting."
"Hassan, Umer","I liked Professor Hassan, he was a very nice person. He is clearly very knowledgeable but his lectures were a bit confusing. His slides were a pretty good resource but some of his oratory was sometimes confusing. Clearly, he puts in a fair amount of effort into his lectures, and hopefully, he will improve. | Professor Umer Hassan is a good guy. He is patient and is a very easygoing professor. But, his lecture does not work for me. It is tedious and not straight forward. Still, his lecturing does not follow my way of thinking. It is not logical and well organized in my perspective. I will not recommend you to take his class. | He is a great professor and very easy to talk to. He posses great knowledge about his subject and more than happy to help put students who are interested in his subject. Clear grading criteria"
"Spasojevic, Predrag","Good luck. | Okay he's not the worst but I do want to say that overall the grading criteria is not clear. Labs take a very long time (5+ hours) and I had a hard time completing them - all to be completed in 1 lab period which is only 1.3 hrs. He gave a nice curve and opportunities to improve your grade but I would not want to take this class again. | Pop quizzes every week with no partial credit; labs are brutal (5-8 hours, graded tough) and worth 60% of your grade. Try to ask questions, email him, come to office hours, and pay attention to the review session to do well on the midterm. Be ready to spend as much time on this class as you would on two or three normal classes | professor is so bad and the all the TAs are even worst, Labs need at least 5-7 hours each to complete and you get like an hour and a half. Lab assessments are a joke, you got 6 mins to debug a code. Grading is no mercy. This is a joke. | Doesn't post slides. Uses the slides given directly from the textbook and expects students to find it themselves online. Sends random announcements as he pleases. This is a senior level class and is expected to be tough but the level of difficulty he creates his class syllabus is not justified for the difficulty of the actual material. | He's terrible at outlining what the cutoffs are or how his assignments are weighted. More than halfway into the semester and students are just finding out how much the midterm is worth and yet still have no clue how much each individual lab is worth. He adjust his syllabus as he pleases and doesn't write down anything for students. | Others have already said what's been going on. This class is meant for engineering seniors. A lot of us already are overloaded trying to finish our major requirements and don't have time for all this extra work. One of our lab assessments some people had to read instructions/code/debug in 6 minutes while others just had to talk about their own work | Can't teach. Outside of the mandatory lectures (because of pop canvas and paper quizzes) and mandatory weekly lab attendance (where each lab takes 6-8 hours to complete) he also assigns LAB ASSESSMENTS which he isn't even present for and students are given 6 min to demonstrate EXCELLENCE in the subject when they literally learned it the week prior | The lectures are just lecture slides that he reads off of for the entirety of the class. He doesn't post annotations to the slides nor the slides themselves. We are expected to find them online as they are ""on the internet"". Adjusts the syllabus as he pleases and as the semester progresses. Doesn't clearly outline how much assignments are worth. | Mandatory attendance for weekly labs that take like 5-8 hours each. None get graded for weeks, the TA's barely can help, and the actual lab work requires boards that are only accessible during your designated lab period (1hr 20 min). No consideration for any of the other courses we are taking. This class is 3 credits but he makes it feel like 6. | Terrible professor and has made me hate the material we learn. We are expected to complete a pre and post lab for a weekly lab session that is only 1 hr 20 min even though the entirety of each lab takes 2-6 hours outside of the course. | The amount of work is absolutely insane. Every week you spend hours doing the post lab for the previous lab, then the prelab for the next lab, go to in-person labs with mandatory attendance, prep for pop quizzes (happen every week, no partial credit), and then finally midterms. For a 3 credit class, the work is absolutely not justified! | I had no problems with him personally, he was a pretty funny. His course structure was pretty bad, not much room to recover if you did bad on a exam or multiple quizzes. My grade was saved thanks to the Rutgers strike our final was made optional. Anything above a 30 percent was passing so as long as you put the work in you'll definitely pass. | Rude, 2 quizzes per week, no partial credit, lectures are just reading slides. | This class is not easy especially if you are not well versed in LSS . The homework are matlab assignments with his lectures can be somewhat helpful but when the assignment is submitted is grade he uploads solutions. Even though he gives the conceptual explanation he does not give the code to understand how its done. | this guy is a joke, just like most ECE professors here. he doesnt care about you or the class. his lectures are so boring, even he's half asleep. he doesn't do anything, he makes the TAs do everything. I've not seen a lazier professor. These ECE professors really need to retire, the entire department needs a big change but no one will do anything. | VERY boring, uncaring lecturer. Class is essentially a review of all CE curriculum, but he presents it in the worst way possible. Quizzes and exams have NOTHING to do with the lectures. Lab is completely disorganized, the TAs do the best they can but it's not enough. Pray for the curve | I've never had a professor worse than him to be honest. His monotonous tone will put event the most attentive student. This course is supposed to be a review of what we have done over the past few years as computer engineers and I can't bring myself to believe how uninteresting he makes my major seem. I commute and I'd rather get into a car crash. | He's a terrible professor to take a class with. I took a graduate level course with him and his class was anything but terrible. His exams are super tough and he barely teaches anything in the class. He is an easy grader though and the finals are take home. | This class was very easy as you don't have to put much effort to pass. Quizzes are similar to book problems. Exams are straight forward. Labs are time consuming but doable. | One of the best professors in the ECE dept. at Rutgers. He makes sure you understand the course material. Personally asked him some questions and let me tell you he is very knowledgable and gives tons of examples to make sure you understand. The only con is that he could be a bit more organized in the delivery of his lectures. | Horrible professor. Doesn't know the material or how to teach. Practically reads off the slides and skips things he doesn't understand himself. Exams are impossible, and not related to material at all. Its as if he teaches addition in class and expects you to know derivation on exams. | Extremely insightful and helpful way of explaining concepts. I had a great experience as it is pretty easy to memorize what he taught in class so you don't have to spend too much time revisiting them in those books, which can be long and tedious. | I didnt understand a word he said. I dropped the course | good | He is a very good teacher but the textbook itself is so clear that u dont feel like going to class which is what most ppl do. Even tho the concepts are easy the problems get hard. His exams are hard. If u practice problems a lot ull can get atleast a B. A is hard to get. Don't expect his exams to be similar to the old ones. | He is a very good professor. Comm theory is one of the best classes. | lectures are way too basic and quizzes are insanely easy compared to exams. Exams can be hard, final was insane. Just do all the book problems and old exams. Seems to like to reuse problems. Curve the class really good, so you won't fail but it is hard to get an A since he gives out a very small number of them, maybe 10 at the most. | Nice Professor but insanely hard class. He tries his best to make sure everyone got the concepts right. Its just that the class requires a loooooooooot of effort. If I took the class over again, heres what i would do: practice the hw problems a LOT!! learn the assigned sections for each week's quiz. That seems to be the only way to get an A. | Nice guy, but horrible professor. Only gives like 10 A's in a class of 150. Quizes and homeworks are very basic, but exams are ridiculous. Most people will do horrible on exams but still come out with a C or B. Don't go to class, just read book. His slides are pages directly from the book and just reads off them. | Worst teacher hands down. Examples in class are to easy, quizes are to easy and exams cover unrelated topics beyond the difficulty of an undergrad. I am doing well in the class, so this is not an angry slacker comment. I just don't feel I learned much. Teacher is nice, just in this course he didn't cut it. | one of the best prof i ever had....its ture, he breaks down concepts and makes sure that u understand the material...the course is wayy tooo hard...so are his exams...but, there will be a huge curve...he is a fair grader | initially took this guy just cuz he's yugoslavian like me, but i loved his class and think he's an awesome professor and a great man | He is by far the BEST professor I have had during my tenure at Rutgers. He breaks down concepts to their fundamentals and ensures that you understand what hes talking about before moving on. Excellent teaching ability and very friendly!"
"Bajwa, Waheed Uz Zaman","He gives a lot and he expects a lot. You will have a ton of useful resources but the course workload is extremely demanding. You will learn a ton in the course and will also comprehend the content well if you put in the time/effort. Test are fair but are comprehensive. Puts a lot of effort into the course. Receptive to student challenges. | Bajwa is a nice guy and good teacher, but is simply ignorant to the amount of work he gives to students. Most classes have quizzes, exams, a final, and mandatory attendance. He has Video Quizzes, Assessment Quizzes, 4 Lectures a week (2 more assigned for you to watch at home), Homework, a Final, and a Group Final Project. Averages were in the 50's. | I took this class in Spring 2020. He didn't care about the pandemic and assigned a lot of work. You have to do a quiz before class, during class and his homework were a headache. Don't skip class, you're only hurting yourself | He really is a good teacher but this is an extremely hard class. I do wish the final project was a group project or atleast a smaller project. But I did get experience in working with python libraries and you will definitely learn a lot. The pace of the class was fast for me but everyone is different. It's a good class with great professor | He could care less that a global pandemic was going on. He assigned so much work and gave no time to fully complete it. Also, he never prepared you for the work. Took off so many points for getting things wrong and were not lenient at all with grading. Made a group project a solo project. Webcam and Workspace to been seen, worse than proctortrack | a very decent professor who really cares about his students! well-organized class and clear logic. highly recommended! | Bajwa is one of the best professors in ECE and people who complain about him dont deserve him. I learned so much in his class despite i almost failed his prereq class LSS. I enjoyed the course, and he truly cares about his students and their success. His exams are very fair and nothing surprising. His flipped class might come off unorthodox. | Bajwa is the man. Generally a very nice guy who puts in a lot of work into his students. The homework takes time, but it is absolutely doable within a reasonable period. He is also a very engaging professor, and a stone cold killa | Professor Scolds us at 8:40 for being on our phones after assigning 5-6 hours of homework due in class. He has no how much work he assigns or how the student's feel doing his work. He is also pompous and stuck up. If you want to be burred in busy work and have an overall unenjoyable semester take his class. | I took 3 classes with him and I got 3 A's. However, I hate his teaching. Boring boring and boring. Don't take his class. | Professor Bajwa uses a flipped class teaching method and you can tell he truly cares about his students. In the beginning, the videos can be a drag but pay attention to them and take notes it will help you during in class problems. The tests can be a bit challenging, there was some solid curves in my class, but overall I left loving the class. | The king of busy work. If you need a professor to hold your hand through the semester so you don't fail, he's your guy. If you're a decent student who can manage their own time well and learn material on their own, his constant homeworks and quizzes just become tedious and repetitive. | Bajwa best. | Best professor in ECE department. A lot of work involved, in class and outside of class, but the repetition of material and examples definitely helps come exam time. Midterms aren't especially challenging but the final is tough. The amount of work he puts into the class makes you want to work even harder. | One of the best ECE professors at Rutgers. He's tough, but he genuinely cares about how his students perform. He splits the grading so that doing poorly on exams won't end you (thankfully!), and you have opportunities to make up for it. Class attendance is mandatory because of these mini problems he makes you do, so it's more like recitation. | You can learn a lot from Dr. Bajwa's vast resources as he truly cares about the class. However the content of the class can be challenging if your Math foundation isn't good. The downside is that Dr. Bajwa takes everything so personally to the point that he can make the class very uncomfortable with his direction esp. for class participation. | Very hard material to understand. Mostly because the DSP book by Oppenheim is HORRIBLE. Try using different DSP books and not this one. Also, final was very tough. 1st midterm was a little tough, but second midterm was easy. He's very helpful if you go to his office hours and he's always willing to help out! | The hardest prof. I have ever seen, exams are nightmare, homeworks are IMPOSSIBLE. If you are smart enjoy As else Enjoy Fs | The professor was very clear when lecturing and always helpful in office hours. He allowed us to use our notes/books/hw solns on the exams. HW was simple & exams were C+P of hw. Exams were too easy so avgs were very high, as a result final was super hard; took many people out of the A range. Also final was hard to punish cheaters with soln manual. | probably the best teacher in this department. while that may not be saying much, given how bad some of our professors are, bajwa really does try his best to help the class understand the material. The homework is pretty ridiculous but the midterms are pretty easy. the final is also ridiculous but he curves well."
Striki Maria,"The reviews of her are very accurate. If possible avoid at all costs. Tough exams, no outside resources to learn her material, impossible to understand, answer keys are wrong and don't match lecture. Everything feels random; I didn't end up learning much at all and her curve was not that big either. However, she is somewhat helpful in office hours. | She is the first professor I've had who manages to make a complicated topic even more difficult to understand. Lectures are confusing and not worth going to except for quizzes, the slides fail to emphasize the most vital topics and often contain conflicting statements, and overall not a good professor for this highly technical class. | Striki cares about her students. You won't fail her courses if you give effort. That being said, her lectures are confusing, homework is unsolvable without hours of extra research, & she. just. doesn't. stop. with. the. assignments. Felt like a semester of busy-work. Expect HW, projects, quizzes, midterms, papers, and labs. No, that is not a joke. | She was very confusing and it was a struggle to understand the content. I recommend you teach yourself and make friends. Just take one step at a time and don't forget about the projects. Get capable group members. It may benefit to just have one other group member that you trust rather than 2 or three that you aren't sure about. | She is an angel, the savior of ECE students' GPAs with all her extra credit and lenient grading. She noticed students were struggling on the midterms so made homework most of the grade, which she goes through similar examples in class. You will never take a professor better than Striki in ECE, the true inspiration to all of us engineering students. | She is caring and really does want the best for her students. However that is the only good thing about her class. Her exams/quizzes were way harder than necessary. Class was disorganized and lecture was confusing. Projects and Homework were way harder than necessary and I honestly don't think I have learnt much from her class. Better to avoid. | Her lectures are crystal clear and shes very easy to understand with her explanations. The material is super interesting and fundamental if you want to be an electrical engineer. It's all Risc-V, binary arithmetic, and processor and pipelining. Her exams are very much on the same level with her homework and the class examples. | Striki is a very caring professor. She wants her students to do well and learn. She is very nice to her students but is often put under a lot of stress. She will not fail you if you give an effort and reach out to her. The reason for her bad reviews is not her as a person, but rather as a professor. Big difference, unfortunately she can't teach!!!! | Grading criteria and due dates for assignments were always unclear from day one. Does not reply to student emails. And good luck trying to find something specific from her class notes as they're all in one 300 slide long PowerPoint. Homework and quizzes were way more in-depth than anything she discussed during lectures. Find a different professor. | There wasn't enough time in any of the quizzes or exams. in the final, people got 2,3, etc out of 42. the smart kid got an 11. Also, people got a 2 but when asked ""11 is the lowest grade"" :/ | She is one of those professors who writes her exams knowing students will not be able to finish and so she will need to curve accordingly. She also assigned so much work: we had projects, homework, presentations, quizzes, and exams. Her projects and homework took up to 12 hours PER QUESTION. The due dates would overlap as well, beware | Good luck taking this class, its 15 weeks of straight confusion for you and the teacher. She quite often sends out assignments(HW, QUIZZES, ETC)much later than originally intended and never gives us a reason why. | If at all possible I recommend that you avoid taking any classes with striki. Everything she does she means well, but she cannot teach. On top of that she has horrible timing issues. Dont worry a 30% will get you a B | This class has been a solid 15 weeks of straight confusion, shes very nice and means well, but wow... Youll come into this class knowing less then what you went in with | How do I put this... I can tell that she cares about the class, and that she's also having a tough time. However, she has little concept of timing. Exams can and have been delayed due to her tardiness. Again, she has valid reasons for it, but it's not right at all. Also, she isn't the best at communicating. And you might receive messages at 3 am... | She is a really nice person, but I don't think she should be allowed to teach. Expect her being late to lecture/posting assignments and frequent errors on tests. This class was without a doubt the most unclear, confusing and useless 15 weeks I have ever experienced. The professor needs to overhaul every facet of this class just for it to be decent. | Professor Striki is a very nice person. However, as a professor, that is about all she has going for her. Avoid her for any class she teaches, you will get nothing out of it and suffer through it the entire way. On the first day of class, she failed to compile a C file using gcc and accidentally deleted its contents . Inexcusable & embarassing... | Yes, she's as bad as everyone here is writing. Sweetheart of a person and generous with grades, but the teaching is disorganized and hard to follow (both online and in person). Good luck | I read all these reviews prior to taking Strike and thought I knew what I was getting into. She is significant worse than I expected/thought was possible. She is by far the least competent Professor, or person, I have ever come across. Grading takes months (often without feedback), answer keys have errors, and she doesn't understand the material. | Striki literally built different. She can't post exams at the times she says she gonna post them. She hasnt graded anything and its been 5 weeks. It's quite baffling at how distant she is from actually knowing how to use a computer, and more ironic that she literally ""teaches"" about computers. She makes announcements in Greek. 0/10 | She purposefully makes her questions make no sense and she expects you to be able to read her mind and understand what she is actually asking. She shows up late to most of the lectures. She always goes over time by at least 10 minutes. Asks questions on quizzes that are not in the notes or book. | very disorganized, not great at lecturing, test and quizzes were very very tough. Class is not structured very well | Very nice person. She means well. But lectures and material are impossible to comprehend. Very disconnected from students. Projects involve intricate C coding when half the class has never even programmed in C. Lots of work too. Exams are long, full of typos, and it's never clear what shes asking. Heavy curve and lenient grader due to low averages. | It sucks that such an important class like CompArch is taught by her. After speaking to classmates, it's mainly those that have prior experience that do well. If you're a total noob, you will drown cause her lectures are dry/hard to follow and the material isn't widely available online. Her questions on exams and hw are super wordy and confusing. | She teaches us horribly, blames us for doing poorly on the exam and not studying enough, and assigns us the exam again for homework again after giving no feedback on it. Her exam questions make no sense and are impossible to comprehend. Can't even solve her own exam/homework problems correctly. Do NOT take Striki!! | 1) Class isn't mandatory. Show up once a week so you know what chapter she's covering. 2) Ask her what chapters will be on the quiz/exam. Then read the textbook (2) hours a week. 3) She's very nice and loves when students interact with her. 4) I put in a decent amount of work to get an A. She won't fail you if you try. 5) Don't be in a lazy group. | Expected A/B+ , earned B. Grading was strict but I liked the course. Learned a lot. Super hard projects but helpful. Agree with exams being super long but were also smart, nothing I've seen so far in ECE. Prof is quite good. She covered certain topics really deep. Slides are confusing. Must attend lecture to make sense out of these, else forget it | This is my second time taking her (Comp Arch & Comp Systems) and I learned very little for both courses. Her quizzes and final are okay if you read the book a lot. The midterm was tough and super long. Projects are a pain and homework was not bad but takes a lot of your time. She is very caring if you talk to her during her office hours. Good luck! | Worst professor in the entire ECE department. Zero common sense when it comes to logistics, and makes an already confusing subject even more confusing by not coming prepared to lecture. Exams are full of mistakes and you'll never finish them in time even if you study for weeks beforehand. However, she gives extensions on homework/projects often. | Horrible...... You won't learn anything and it's a sad thing since you paying for it. However, you won't fail this class at all since her curve is so generous that everyone passes this class. Super Long exams and around 2 quizzes. Lets put it this way if you want to pass without going to class take her, if you want to learn take it with Burdea. | Nice as a person, but horrible at grading, teaching, and having common sense. Avoid her at all cost | Great lecturer, nice lady. Her slides though are little messy. Must attend lectures to make sense out of them. Examples on forks, synchro, critical section were great. Finally figured when to use semaphores and when CVs. In CS you must study UNIX manuals completely on your own, I find ECE lectures much more effective. Exams were tough: have mercy! | Guys give the prof a break, she moved around dates cuz we requested extensions all the time. This was a savior, I got extra time to finish all assignments. HW and projects were really cool, learned a lot. And kinda liked her exams cuz many questions were like challenger puzzles which I guess made people mad but I enjoyed. Prof is very smart & nice. | The tests and quizzes are made to be hard and the course material gives little-moderate material on them. As long as you are at or slightly above the test average you will be fine. I wish this class was a little more structured. She gave us what materials to study on the final the midnight prior to the 8am final. She also surprise attendance | She's so late with grading. Very disorganized. Terrible teacher. Projects and homework are so long and even she doesn't understand the assignments. The only positive thing about her class is that it's hard to fail; she gives big curve at the end. She only fails 1 or 2 people. Sometimes, she moves deadlines. If this site let me rate her 0, I would. | Horrible horrible teacher. The worst professor in the whole ECE department. You won't learn anything at all. I wish ECE department would give more damn about our mental health. Her changing the grading criteria after the final exam lead to loosing half letter grade for me. I haven't seen any course taught with this much disorganized structure. | Ruined my computer engineering education at Rutgers. Can not function as a professor at all. Completely disorganized class with little to no structure. She can not string together a coherent sentence that is understood by her students. I could have never fathomed someone so incompetent before taking her class. Very nice and caring lady though! | Computer systems is the hardest class you will take, but yet it is taught by the worst professor in the department. Im walking out learning nothing, class is very hard, Striki is disorganized, doesnt grade anything till last minute. | Probably one of the worst professors in the department. She comes to the class unprepared, has no idea what she is teaching. She is incoherent at best and her teaching material is a jumbled piece of garbage. She had no plan for the course. She expects everyone to drop other courses and focus only on her class. | She is the worst professor in the ece department. Always unprepared for lecture, doesnt understand the material. I dont understand how she teaches 3 of the core courses for comp engineering. If you have her for compArch, OS or parallel comp then good luck you will not learn a thing. If you care about passing maintain average, she does curve. | She doesnt understand the material herself. I was clueless about the course hence I spent my Spring break study Intro to OS on Udacity, which is 90% similar to this course. Turns out she is the one who is clueless about the material. She makes simple concepts extremely complicated, sometimes she spends 30 on a slides because she doesnt it. | String theory suggests that there are infinite numbers of parallels universes. Since the amount of matter is finite in each universe, we have many universes that are similar to us with some changes. Hence, anything is possible in other universes. However, I can guarantee you that youll never find a worse professor than Striki. | Horrible, horrible, horrible teacher. I don't know how she still has her job. I'm a senior engineering student and I have never received a grade below a B and I'm currently failing her class in my last semester. GPA runnier, avoid at all cost. | she was an amazing teacher, she was like a mother to me, she helped me a lot and nurtured me whenever I needed nurturing. Her life lessons have helped me get through college and my job. She needs a raise | I have never written a review about a professor before but this had to be done. She is the WORST Professor at Rutgers, in New Jersey, in America, on this Planet, in this Galaxy, in this Universe and probably parallel universes as well. She will spend the entire lecture on one problem trying to figure it out herself then skip thru 20 slides in 1min | The worst professor I ever had in Rutgers. NOT ""one of the worst""!!! It is ""the worst"". | I can confidently say that she can not teach at all. All the material used in the class has been borrowed from other universities. Course material is pretty interesting. You can expect long exams and quizzes (which follow directly from lecture and hw) as well as group projects. I can assure you that the curve is godly, so passing is not an issue. | She is definitely the most uncoordinated and unprofessional professor in the department. Her class was all over the place and totally disorganized. On top of that she is a HORRIBLE lecturer, lets students talk for 50 minutes about a single example. If you can AVOID AT ALL COSTS. If not, then good luck. | probably one the worst professor in the department. She is a horrible lecturer because she lacks any fluidity what so ever. The homework and project she made herself was unclear and she assigned it all at the same time. She is giving the only midterm in April, and if its anything like the quiz the questions will be completely ambiguous. Avoid her | nice lady, curve was fair. The saving grace of this class was that undergrads that did at least 66% as well as grad students were guaranteed at least a C+. But she is terrible at explaining the course material and didn't seem like she understood the material herself. Projects were hard, but fair. Exams were super hard. Her lecture slides were bad. | She is humble and nice, always negotiable about deadline. But I just cannot believe we receive far low grade than another group doing EXACT similar stuff technically. Our project is more complex and she have no idea what we did but criticize on our interface and unfinished part in first demo."
"Marsic, Ivan","There is a semester long project. Team members are expected to know/learn everything on the spot. Lectures are geared more towards asynchronous JavaScript, while the course project requires building a site from scratch; including everything from front end to back end. A database course prior to 452 should help. Wouldn't recommend otherwise. | Group Project grading was unclear, lectures didn't help with said projects, and the homeworks were given so late into semester as the semester long project was already well underway. | I had to take him for a Physics lab. He is very new to teaching and accent makes it so that his explains are vague. He is an extremely biased and tough grader. I was working in a group and I would receive a grade and my group would receive another. AVOID AT ALL COST. He will bring down your GPA. He may appear nice but he is not helpful at all. | Professor Marsic is not suited to teach a class like this. He gives slides on the basics behind certain concepts, but the entire course project is a from scratch website, both backend and frontend. Grading criteria is unclear and often subjective. Unless there is some major change in the class structure this will stay among the worst ECE classes | Professor Marsic has helpful and comprehensive notes as well as lectures. You will learn and practice important software engineering tasks such as having a functional backend to operate with a styled frontend. He answers questions with clarity. | The grading criterion are extremely unclear and he is completely inaccessible, additionally canceling class often so you can't even talk to him then. Class is useless and the assignments are arbitrary and don't teach you anything except to hate his grading methods. The grading on the group project is just as arbitrary and unclear. | One of the worst ECE classes I have ever had. Professor Marsic is a nice guy, but the group project is extremely difficult and takes up more time than I have ever had a class take up. What he taught did not help the project, which made it become a project where group mates either already knew backend code or had no idea what they were doing. | One thing to note about him is he is always late to class and makes most of his lectures online, although they are supposed to be in person. He tries to cover a lot of things (JS, protocols,...) but in an unorganized manner. Although he has a straightforward grading cutoff due to his lecture style, students can lose interest in the topic. | The class is mostly self taught. Lecture is not really helpful for this class. The professor is helpful if you reach out. The feedback though is sometimes unclear, however if you reach out, you will get a prompt response from the professor. | You definitely have to pay attention to his lectures if you want to do well on the quizzes and the reports. If any of your group members slack off, your grade is in jeopardy. His grading scale is very vague and his outdated website does not do a good job of explaining it. He expects you to know JS/WebDev coming in, so be prepared. | Project is all self taught and has nothing to do with his lectures. In addition, he makes you submit long unnessasary weekly reports that are just a big distraction from doing the project. It's already enough work learning a new coding language, applying it to our project, and balancing our other classes. One report to plan the project is enough. | If you have a good group and you guys split up the work evenly the class will be manageable. If you have slackers in your group the class with be unbearable. The quizzes are going to boost your final grade by half a letter grade if you do well on them and if you do horrendous on them they'll decrease your final grade by half a letter grade. | He is a good professor and gives real examples of whatever he is teaching. However this is one of those classes where the lecture doesn't matter. This class is about group projects and how people back stab you in the back for a grade. Be wise on who you pick, otherwise you will end up paying the consequences. Easy Final and 20 quizzes in total | As a mentor and lecturer, this guy gives you valuable lessons in software if ur interested in that. But the stuff he talks about has nothing to do with the major project in the course. All of that you have to learn yourself and takes a ridiculous amount of time. Be unique with your project and make sure everyone stays on point/don't be too nice. | great mentor and guide. involved in lot of research work and provides opportunity to work on them. | Nice professor | He will teach you ambiguously and with non interest so teach yourself did... | It was his first time teaching the course, lectures weren't very useful but pop quizzes made them mandatory. Homework was far too long, and he didn't know what he assigned. Exams are huge and graded by ESL TAs, poorly. | 'Stock Forecasting' project (graded) to be done by students in this class gives a great insight into Stock prediction techniques and the Web Architecture for hosting Stock Predictor site. This project helped me in getting Interview calls from Top Financial Firms in New York for Technology positions in their organization. | Very good prof for grad students. Involved in variety of research work. | Professor is good. | Open Notes/Book Exams. Group project throughout the semester. Really helpful at office hours and exams were fair. He mostly uses his own book that he is writing. The project is a pain following all of the standards but it's to drill home for concepts. Late for class occaisionaly. | Computer networks. Interesting class, learned alot. Hard exams, but nice prof. | Softaware Engineering is bad, not really Marsic. The class is kind of like a **** corporate seminar, except except you also have to program something. He also makes you do ""Object Constraint Language""; the textbook I bought basically said they had never seen an actual project use OCL. | This class was pointless. The prof is unclear about pretty much everything. His lectures have nothing to do with exams. His exams are too many questions for the time frame. The TA is the worst ever. There was a group project, which was neat and was 40% of our grade. 1 Mid and 1 Final avgs are about 40 ish. There needs to be a complete overhaul. | excellent professor | What really matters here is that 452 is a stupid class. Marsic is cool... but 452 tries to take trivial concepts like ""teamwork"" and ""object oriented design"" and make it complicated. They should just have a class that teaches you to make cool things in C/C++, and skip the UML Bullshat. | If you have an 8:10 with him you won't have to show up until 8:45. The lectures are hit or miss so it pays to attend them all. Hope for a good TA or you will be doing a lot of your learning from a book. | One of the worse professors in the ece department. One of those classes which no one really knows whats going on and yet everyone ends up with a B and like 11 kids out of 120 get A's but still come on, teach us something! As least Rose was difficult but willing to teach.. | Just plain horrible.. If he arrived in class on time instead of 10 minutes later EVERY time maybe he could have taught the material that would have been covered in the exam | Good looking professor, really hot."
"Najafizadeh, Laleh","Gave hard weekly quizzes and doesn't curve and threw plenty of curve balls on the exams. Boring lectures too. | Really good professor, very understanding and clear. Stay engaged in class and do the hw assignments(can be tedious) and you'll be fine. She doesn't mind if you ask questions, exams are alright if you go over the outline she gives One of the few good ECE professors | Lectures were phenomenal, explains complex topics very clearly and is willing to stop to answer even the dumbest questions from students. Weekly quizzes were tough but fair and exams were very straightforward & similar to the course material. Learned a lot and had a pleasant experience with her overall. | Best professor in ECE for circuits courses by far. Explains things very intuitively, and focuses on understanding why things happen instead of just number crunching. Class is basically BJT and MOSFET amplifiers. It's a tough class but if you pay attention in class and study your notes, it's easy to succeed | Her lectures are crystal clear and shes very easy to understand with her explanations. theres homework and a quiz every week. The material is super interesting and fundamental if you want to be an electrical engineer. It's all amplifiers, bjts and mosfets. Her exams are very much on the same level with her homework and the class examples. | Really interesting material. Sometimes hard to follow lectures but very helpful if you stay engaged."
"Dana, Kristin","A really good professor with wisdoms. She can explain most of questions you have and make you understand the principals behind the knowledge. The homework is tough if you only work without help even for graduate students but it is worthy for taking that course. | Solid class with interesting projects. | One of the best I had at Rutgers !!!! | Good course that covers a lot of material with a genuinely interesting lecture. Expect a lot of work, time-consuming projects, and very long exams. Beware if you are interested in robotics: this course is entirely about computer vision. | No Comments | No Comments | No Comments | Good enough prof. Relatively easy class, not enough time given for exams but they are curved. Text book only used for HW. Would recommend. Only went to lectures and occasionally did the HW and got a C+. So if you study and go to recit you'll do good. | Good professor, she does a good job explaining everything. However, she was consistently 10-15 minutes late. quizzes are simple but tests make you apply the material you learn, study lecture notes and do the homework and youll do fine | After taking DLD last year and suffering, i greatly appreciate Dana. She's extremely fair and a pretty good teacher. This is her first semester teaching 231, but she knows what she's doing. You've got to keep up with homework and reading, and the class is no sweat if you do. | she has the WORST common sense as a professor that I have ever seen. Doesn't give enough time for midterm, quizes are a piece of cake. just hope you have a good TA | No Comments | Nice Prof.... One of Rutgers' prof that actually do what they got paid to do. Unlike some EE prof. *Cough* nutti *Cough* ammone.... Really easy exam. Realy hard project... Just do what you can, she's a nice grader."
"Yuan, Bo","good guy, very lenient, helps students when he can, nothing is too difficult, many extensions | Spent half of the semester talking about history of chips. Generous on grading. Not a good elective choice"
"Soljanin, Emina","Very good lecturer, willing to answer student's questions and clearly explains the material even for a difficult subject. She encourages student participation and wants you to really understand the material as opposed to just rote memorization. Tests/quizzes were fair, but try to attend lecture as much as possible. | She was difficult to understand, lectures were confusing, the TAs had no clue what was going on. I learned from online videos and half the class didn't take the final exam. Most people walked out after an hour and we had two hours of allotted time to take it. I barely went to lectures because she wouldn't answer questions or didn't understand us. | She's sweet and tries to help, but her lectures are low-quality. You will learn mostly from recitation, hoping you have a good TA. Most students end up not going to her lectures -- but you should, because at the end of the semester she bumps up those who participate a lot. | More than half of the class from my semester did not know a single thing about probability by the time the final came around which should say enough about the quality of the class. The recitations were exponentially more helpful than the lectures which did not do a good job in teaching us the material we needed to know. | Class starts easy but turns hard halfway through and she doesn't transition to this content very well. Teaches content very fast and does not wait for students to understand it before moving on. Be prepared to watch Youtube/read halfway through. Lectures slides can be organized better. Quizzes for every lecture. 5 MATLAB assignments. | crappy class | The class itself is hard. The point of taking a class is to learn but this is one of those classes that you will learn absolutely nothing. Lecture are useless and if you don't have a good TA then you have to learn everything by yourself. The exams are hard but the homework can help you pass this class. She curves but depends on the average | if you want to understand what it means to learn absolutely nothing from an academic lecture, attend professor soljinan's lecture. clearly disorganized, copy pastes her lecture onto useless slides, reads off the slides and calls it a day. this is where student money goes, for teachers like her to do this. | Lectures are useless and she is a tough grader for no reason even if she gave didn't provide an explanation. My advice is to take it in summer. Any time when she isn't teaching. | The worst ever | Terrible teacher | awful teacher, teaching wasn't really meant for her. she's nice and very intelligent but not good at teaching it. HerTA Chrysanthi Koumpouzi is the most rudest and unprofessional educator. The emails she sends and the condescending demeanor toward students resembles a petty12 year old. Her ego is the type that should never be in a postion of power | She is a good Professor who teaches and motivates students well. Given that she was asked to teach a Math course to a class of >250 students (Rutgers way of teaching, not the Professor's fault), she did a good job. The course is hard for most of us since we do not have a good Math background and neither have the willingness to learn much. | I feel like she was a good professor. Her slides are good and her quizzes are easy if you go to recitation. You have to go to lecture and you gotta study for the tests, but she helps by giving several review periods and curivng generously. If you come to every class and study (she tells you what's on the test), then you'll do well. I learned a lot. | Not one of the best professors in the department. Lecture was useless, she has trouble conveying information and actually teaching. The worst part is the exams have very few problems on them and are very particularly graded so you really have to teach yourself to do well. You can do well in her class but you have to scrounge around for practice. | I really did not like her. I think she has to be one of the worst professors I've taken at Rutgers thus far. Her class was just so bad. She taught the class in a way that made it hard to actually learn and she was really rude at answering student questions. The TA's made the class a lot better but they couldn't save us from how bad she was! | Her class was really disorganized. The two textbooks she provided lacked examples and practice problems, and the material wasn't taught in a very clear manner. The TAs were great and able to make the class bearable. Even though I did well in the class, I was disappointed with how the class was structured and taught."
"Ortiz, Jorge","60% of the grade is determined by Quizes he has not remorse for his students and seems to only hope on their downfall, he gives quizzes that are far beyond what an introductory course could be able to handle. We had quizzes consisting of 30 plus pages with only 120 minutes, virtually impossible to complete, average is around a 35 for a C | grading criteria 4 ""Quizzes"" -60% Lab -10% Participation -10% 2 Projects -20% First class, someone said his office hours were when most - if not all - students had PEE2 (eng. class), and he said ""that's not my problem."" This projects are hard, he takes off 40% if your project doesn't compile through the autograder. This is not an ""INTRO"" class. | His class is really well run with the minus the projects. Exams and Labs are well made and help understanding, but the projects require far greater prowess than anything else in the class. Just getting everything up and running to be able to start the project can be a nightmare if you aren't familiar with C development. He's still solid though | Awful awful professor. Decent guy but terrible projects with no direction. Lazy with assignments and tests. | Easily my worst prof. Class is ""INTRO"" to C and the first coding class in ECE. He starts w/ advanced topics and breaks them down. This only works if the person has prior coding knowledge (Im lucky I do but my friends dont, had to teach them everything). Grades are 2 months behind. Hes also stuck up and will tell you hes an MIT grad and hes humble. | He simply can't teach, I had to self learn every single thing in this class, he also doesn't care about students. He gave us 3 HARD projects, and expected ALOT from us while he didn't give or put enough effort in the class. Definitely needs improvement, and I would never take him again although I got an A. | If you're in it for the grade strictly, he's a great professor. He makes the projects and exams relatively easy to get >90. Also, there is a curve on the exams (84+ is A). The lectures are dry, but you don't have to go. The projects and HWs take probably an afternoon. Exam questions are confusingly and clumsily worded. | This is the worst professor that I have ever had in my entire life. | I absolutely hated coding after this class, Lectures are extremely heavy, we didn't learn much, and tests were too hard, they literally had nothing to do with what we did in class. He also doesn't care about students at all. I hope the best for him, but I simply hate the way he teaches and presents the materials. He skipped really important topics. | Do yourself a favor. I don't usually do this, but this guy was so bad I had no choice. LIKE PLEASE. DO. NOT. DO. IT. He went to MIT and he'll let you know that every day. He'll try to make you feel like you did too. | Does not sympathize with students. Class got an average of 30 on the first midterm and he boasts about how no one could do well onhis exams"
"Southard, Phillip","One of the best courses at Rutgers ECE to actually prepare you for industry. With that said you got to put in the work. He structures the class so you are NOT thrown into the fire. The book is super useful as a reference. He eases you into VHDL and each lab builds on top of the next. This course will get you a job in industry. | His class prepares you for the real world. This is a class you take to learn and not to slide by. An easy A if you put in the work. | This class was so hard. Your final grade primarily consists of the labs which are graded really harshly and take forever to do. I wouldn't take this class again. Also it wasnt a great learning experience and the TA's were not that helpful. | Not exactly good at teaching, lectures don't give much of a foundation for labs. Labs will take 5x as long as you think they will and he doesn't really assist with them at all. This class is a lot of work, but you are learning things that are relevant at least... | A useful class in your future carrer but philips is not a good teacher. the slides is not useful for your programming. no coding example, no bug example, just some tedious slides that you can even download from the internet. everthing is learned by yourself from searching online. It is a just another Rutgers-style self-learning class. | Embedded #1: Labs are hard, especially #5. Some Quizzes at the end of the lecture. Some easy homework. Final Project and Presentation Easy Final. You will learn a lot."
"Brown, Philip","Prof. Brown makes the class really manageable for new engineering students. The class is set up to help you succeed, should be an easy A. Projects instead of tests and homeworks every week. Need to submit something in lecture. Overall good class - recitations were helpful for learning. | the class that made me drop engineering. Don't bother with engineering at Rutgers. Professor Brown is an annoying lecturer. He made everyone buy $90 zybooks subscription just for *optional* assignments, except for the weekly attendance check. The class is easy if you have programmed but Brown won't help if you haven't. rip all of our time and money | Even online, there are synchronous recitations. Prof. Brown is a solid prof. His lectures are easy to understand, he explains concepts very well, and is easily accessible outside of class (don't email him, he'll tell you how you should get in contact with him on the syllabus). If you take lectures and recitations seriously, you'll ace the class. | I took him online during covid and he was horrible. The class was meant to be completely remote but he required we go to a mandatory synchronous recitation. He never responded to any questions (emails or on the forum). His lectures were simply voice recordings from when the class was live put over the slides that correspond. I wish I never had him. | It helps if you have any programming experience whatsoever. But without it it may be a bit of a challenge. Content of the lecture somewhat teaches you the topics, but the assignments are a very high expectation from what is taught in lecture. I did not even find online resources to be that helpful. The grading is also different and almost unfair. | Never take the online course if you are able to take it in person. The online session you don't know anything except for the information posted on slide. He never posted answers to those questions on the PPT. The only way you can communicate with him is through piazza, which usually takes him several days or even a week to respond to your question. | Professor is a snake guys be careful. Lectures are beyond boring and gives you a lot of homework only to count it as 5% and if you don't do the homework that 5% gets pushed to the weight of ex | He is boring but some information provided on the slides are very helpful to understand the beginning of Matlab. The exams were easy but the homework were long. Not bad at all | I went to lecture and just did the HW he assigned instead of paying attention. He was kind of slow in lectures and the online textbook was easier to follow conceptually and you could go at your own pace. Pop quizzes were hard, assignments and tests were relatively easy, final group project was kind of hard. Attendance matters in recitation. | Excellent lecturer, and he kept the class interesting (e.g. he did laps around the room when he taught us about loops). He was always there to help when you needed it, and especially helpful during office hours. As long as you do the work and do the practice tests, getting an A in the class shouldn't be much of a problem. Would highly recommend."
"Antoine, Jean Patrick","We love Dean Jean Patrick Antoine. He is the King of the Honors Academy. | Dean Jean is the best. Very approachable, cares about you, and is very helpful. He is my most favorite person at Rutgers. | Really encourages students to get involved on campus. Shows an interest in helping students prosper. Is available by appointment and likes when student come to see him. Is willing to help out in virtually any problem you are having. Overall a great dean! | Great Dean and Professor. Really cares about the students. But you have to be willing to seek his help and guidance. You have to take the first step, then he'll be able to help you more. | Amazing professor! Really cares for his students' success and pushes everyone to give it their all. Definitely has been my favorite professor so far! | I love this human being | Likes to use class time in a valuable way | Literally the most amazing professor in the world | Guy's a beast | Great Dean/Professor"
"Denda, Mitsunori","It's clear that Professor Denda wants to teach and finds the material to be easy, but he does not explain well and mostly rambles on during the lecture. The material is mostly standard physics, just with slightly different names and a focus on engineering applications. Just wait it out until Professor Lynch, she is far better. | Mitch Denda is just not a good professor. He is barely understandable and just straight up babbles. Lynch is much better tho. All the mastering engineering homework assignments answers are on chegg which is good since 40% of the grade is HW. Study a lot of example problems and learn how to do them QUICK for exams, you will run out of time if not. | Denda is the worst Statics professor. The material is obviously trivial to him, and he does not go into much effort to explain the textbook. Instead his lectures are him rambling and showing solution strategies that are more difficult than what the textbook offers. Still easy class, but can be done without going to lecture. | This professor does not teach and gives an A. I tried to come to lecture and pay attention. None of my peers did. The project turned out horribly. Any professor in the department would fail us. He gave 100. Most of the class had no idea what he taught and came out of the class with no knowledge. | Professor Denda really likes what he teaches. he gives no quizzes or tests, just homework, and a group project, and the project reports are divided into 3 for each month and a final report at the end. Lecture is boring but overall nothing to complain about because of how much extra credit he gives and how easy it is to get an A | Highs - no exams, no final, (they were replaced with group projects), homework is 50% of the grade Lows - you can't really learn anything, we had 4 at least assignments each week Verdict - he doesn't really do a good job at teaching, but the removal of exams and a final exam was the only reason I don't completely dislike him. | Awful professor. Spends lecture reading off of slides that are exact copies of the textbook examples, at a breakneck speed. God forbid you ask him to work out a practice problem, you will be met with ""read the textbook"". Matter of fact, receiving a direct answer to any question from him is rare. Thick accent, 2 homework + readings weekly. Avoid him | exams are all group projects because we were online. the projects were not bad as long as you pick a good group. dont just go w/friends bc if people slack off you end up having to do it all. his lectures are just him talking the whole time, and you cant ask questions until the end or at his office hours right after class. TA grades projects fairly | For online, he is one of the worst profs ever. Every lecture is just his already pre-made slides with examples already SOLVED. Goes through lecture so fast, we were let out 10-15 mins early 90% of the time. You can't ask questions or talk in chat and ask other students for help cuz you are ""interrupting"". Only good thing is exams are group projects | 1 of the worst professors I've had at Rutgers. honestly an embarrassment to the engineering program. teaches absolutely nothing + doesn't let you ask any questions so you're just completely lost the whole time. I am a good student with great studying habits but I did not pay this much to learn absolutely everything on my own. he is a waste i'm sry | Denda is very knowledgeable however he mumbles when he talks and often faces the board when talking to the class. I never went to office hours (which can get you extra credit) but I attended every lecture and got 10 points EC. He doesn't care that you can't make his office hours so don't bother asking. Easy class, just do the work and you'll pass. | Teaching quality is an embarrassment to Rutgers University. Speaks too softly, does not make eye contact with the class, annoying method of attendance, and the class has no idea what is going on lol | I took this class for about 2 and a half months then I withdrew from his class. If you are looking for a professor that will go through 1 statics problem very lightly with doing barely any of the math, then this is the professor for you. He tends to verbally talk you through problems without writing anything. Personally I cant lear that way. | Terrible professor, you cannot understand what he is saying half the time. He talks to the board. He does not explain concepts thoroughly. Overall very difficult to please. Attendance is not mandatory but will be given as extra credit apparently if you go. It is not like you learn anything from his lectures anyway. Don't take him. | Even though lectures are mandatory, he is not the best at lecturing. His exams, however, are pretty straightforward if you study using the book and powerpoints that he gives. He is also pretty lenient on partial credit. He also gives up to 10 extra credit points onto the Final Grade, as well as a fairly easy Final Group Project instead of a Final. | This class is very doable as he gives extra credit for office hours. Definitely go at least 3 times. It's possible to get up to 10 points extra credit (on your final grade) in this class. Tests can be difficult so make sure to study and be organized on the test, there is a good amount of partial credit. Not a very good lecturer but good one on one. | Denda is such a nice guy to talk to about anything except statics. Lectures are below sub-par and teaching quality is asystole. I never did physics nor any eng classes n i crawled out with a B but i had to work my soul away. Exams are really hard and long. If u wind up in tjis class seek help at tutoring or people that did the class. Project is lit | Going to Denda's lecture is completely useless, I didn't learn anything. Go to recitation though, the problems done there will help you with the homework and the exams. The exams are weird, they're only 2 or 3 problems. Do the homework and go to recitation and you'll be fine. The final was replaced with an easy group project so an A is easy to get. | He is a very nice person cares about students gives extra credit. You need to study, do the HW and do the projects right. His TA (Yasir) is a great person, great help, take the class , specially if he is the TA. | Don't bother going to class, you won't learn anything. Office hours are helpful, but he won't accommodate you if you can't go to office hours. Won't give any special extensions for homework for any reason ever. Grading was never clear, and just not fair sometimes. Doesn't care about students. Just take advantage of his extra credit and move on. | reads off slide, which is a powerpoint from a different professor from a different college. Didn't feel like making a sample exam. goes off topic about his research | Denda spends a large portion of his time taking attendance from a list. He is usually not helpful when you ask questions. His grading scheme is unfair and penalizes students for small, arithmetic mistakes. He gives many extra credit opportunities so be sure to take advantage of them. | He will straight up tell you that if you don't sit in the first few rows then you won't pass the class. He doesn't care to address the entire room just talks to the first few rows. He is unprepared with his own power points and constantly makes mistakes or doesn't understand the diagram he is showing. Takes attendance, though lectures are useless | I actually liked this class, but I failed the second exam and never got it back. I thought I did well, but my grade was so low I had to drop it before she had time to even give it back. Even after I dropped it she never got back to me on my mistakes which makes me think there was a mistake in grading, so she obviously doesn't care about students. | Super nice guy, very small attendance at lecture, but he seems to like it that way,and throws a lot of shade at non-attendees. Didn't learn much from lecture, but I think it was more so because you learn statics by doing problems, but he tried his best. | Denda requires you to go to class on time and personally takes attendance every day, which is a shame because his lectures are thoroughly useless. Homework and exams aren't easy, and you'll get no help from Denda. This is a self-taught class if there ever was one. | he is a nice professor. He loves to teach other students. exams are similar to lecture and homework and not very hard. interesting class. | Quite boring. He teaches by reading his lecture slides. He takes attendance to ensure the students come. He assigns mounds of weekly homework and grades them thoroughly. His exams are straight textbook problems but they are typically the difficult ones. He grades them extremely harshly. | He is hard to understand and he only helps if he thinks you already tried the assignment. Make sure you work on everything early and get help when you can. His quizzes are EXACTLY the same as his practice quizzes (numbers are changed though). Use book for some homework problems. | Professor Denda is a strict one. I like the format of the class, but it requires you to attend the class all the time, because there's not enough materials to study independently. Plus, one section starts very early. The worst part of this class is the amount of time needed to do the homework and projects. | Professor does not help even at office hours. He just tells you to read his notes, which do not help. And his projects are of no use to real life, and just simply very time consuming. | What a cute little Japanese man. he is very intelligent and he wants us to learn the concepts well. Since you will most likely have to take him, here's some advice: do the extra credit with the computer projects--you will go way over 100 that way. also understand the concepts- it will be impossible writing a code for something you don't understand | His class was not difficult, but it required 12 hours of work every Friday. Go to his office hours which he gives you points, and participate in class. He definitely care about his students, but he hates lazy people. Overall, I will say he is a good professor. | He explains complicated algorithims by waving his hands in the air. this is CRAZY because he never cared to use one of the 3 boards behind him to show 1 EXAMPLE. THIS IS NOT ALL!! and when u actually care about doing well and go hiis office hours, he is very rude and wants to get rid of u cuz your waisting his time... i hope ur reading this DENDA | Professor Denda speaks in broken English..this is analogous to how he teaches. He will prepare lecture slides and jump around the slides just mentioning things that we might need to know. He will not teach the material, he will only show you what you might need to know, in the most unorganized manner possible. Horrible, horrible, horrible teacher!! | Professor Denda is a nice man who wants all of his students to do well. However, he is very vague in his teaching and doesn't provide the students enough information to properly prepare for quizzes and projects. The book used also is very useless as it doesn't provide any examples of how to apply the learned methods. | Besides the fact that you cant undertand him, He never ever finishes a problem in class. It is impossible for him to explain how to do something fully. Had it not been for my TA i would have failed | Asks for too much participation and does not actually teach the material very well. But he is an overall fair grader and tries to help. | Although his English is garbled at best, he does make an attempt to know everyone. His lectures are entertaining but not very informative. Personally, I had to teach myself everything from the book but beware of the final, it's much harder than the midterm! | Nice guy, but you can't understand him at all | He's a nice guy. | cool dude, easy class, and hes funny as hell. ""Brah, Brah, Brah"" | I don't remember the specific class, but I rememeb him. Cool teacher, good guy. | knows his stuff...his methods are a little comfusing at time but he always willing to help you out | No Comments | So far he seems to make the class entertaining, but overall he seems to be a good guy and very nice. | Easy class, although don't really learn much. Gives points for participation and really attempts to learn names. If he knows your name, the better you will do. Will easily pass class if you do the workshops and bring them to exams. Everything is open book. Overall a nice guy. | No Comments"
"Scacchioli, Annalisa","Not at all as bad as people say | Caring as a person but not a great lecturer, and a bit disorganized. I rarely went to lectures, and even when I went, I would not understand the material. A very lenient grader with a lot of extra credit, quizzes can be easy if you understand the homework; just self-study the class or sign up for tutoring. Good luck! | I heard bad things before entering her class, but she is actually very good! She has tons of resources - pre lecture textbook examples, lecture notes, extra practice problems. There is extra credit, exams are mid level in difficulty, and based more on textbook examples. My suggestion is to practice the textbook examples associated with each lecture | Plug should not be teaching. Class is easy and exam scores can always be argued. | Very nice person. However, she doesn't teach well. She creates her own variables for equations, which confuses students than actually making the content easier to learn. | She cares very much about the success of her students. She provides slides for her lectures and uses a camera to show her work and steps live. She actually provides time to do practice problems in class instead of just lecturing. Her exams have two parts: an individual stage and a collaborative stage. She encourages regrade requests on Gradescope. | Professor Scacch was a nice person. As a professor I was not a fan of her, there's a lot of things to keep up with in her class, grades everything last minute, QRRs she made even more annoying. She has 3 quizzes, they were not the worst and the lowest you could get if you tried was a 40% on exams. | She's not organized at all, but she gives a ton of extra credit. Use the exam regrades because she grades the exams quickly and always misses stuff, so you can get like half your missed points back. The homework is not helpful at all but I just did it for the grade. | Yes, she is a sweet teacher and tries to be understanding. But as a professor, I'm sorry no. Her handwriting is pretty unreadable and her notes are so unhelpful. She is not organized with the way she does her problems so when you look back at her notes you are like what the heck? | Shes a great person, but shes terrible at lecturing. She makes up her own variables and calls her midterms ""quizzes"" so you cant miss them or make them up. Honestly, great lady, but poor lecturer and also terrible at grading. I think she is about to get let go by the MAE department and she is forced to curve our grades a little bit. | She's a nice Professor but the lectures are very different than the homework's, quizzes, and final exam. There are a lot of opportunities she gives for extra credit but it was very difficult navigating through this class. | As a person she is very nice, the quizzes are easy and she gives a lot of extra credit. She is an awful lecturer, she would just talk about signing in to the poll system for 20 minutes. Don't waste your time going to lectures and just use online videos to learn. Also, buying Chegg is very useful for homework. | Awful professor. I am probably passing this class because of how I did on her ""quizzes"" (exams) Did well because of my Physics 1 knowledge. Awful teacher super inconsistent grading. Lots of instances of students having very similar work for the quizzes and there would be a huge grade difference. Read the textbook, watch YT vids n you'll be alright | Just study textbook | Well,everything you read here is true.Disorganized lectures, multiple contradictions during the lectures, and poor engagement of the class. First exam the average was lower then a 40%. Good luck, exam problems aren't like the hw. Made me wait outside during her office hours for a whole hour (shes only avalible for two as well). Nothing else to say. | Honestly, a terrible professor. No effort or energy to engage the class, contradicts herself during lecture multiple times and makes her own variables as she goes. She doesnt really have a way to teach other then off the textbook. Must study hard, but could get a bad grade as she has a terrible teaching style, exam problems are not like the hw. | Took for dynamics. Lectures are boring, and also really hard to keep up with. She does a lot of accommodations (extra credit, surveys, recorded lectures) but it is still really hard to keep up with her. All midterms were online except final. | Easily one of the most frustrating professors to talk to with one of the most annoying, disorganized lectures I've ever had. She wasn't very accommodating re: lab groups when concerns about participation were brought up and refused to allow us to move groups despite letting others work alone. Her and the lab TAs teaching methods were both unclear! | She really is one of the worst professors. Less than 10 students came to her lectures every time and the class average on our final exam was 37%. I'm taking ME Measurements this semester (Mechatronics is a prerequisite), and our professor just said he's planning to report her to the MAE department head for literally teaching us nothing at all. | She's a good person but not a good teacher at all, her handwriting is unreadable for lecture and notes outside of class. The effort she puts into the class is kinda apparent when syllabus' and information about stuff like the final are copy pasted from other classes she teaches. | Advice: when you get your quiz grades back, go through it yourself. There is a high chance they just won't give you points that you clearly deserved, and you will be able to fight for those lost points easily. | She pretends to be nice. She calls her midterms 'quizzes' so that she doesn't have to offer a makeup under Rutgers guidelines if you miss it. Lectures are boring and unhelpful, I was able to pass because most of the class is just physics 1. She uses her own variable system which doesn't make sense unless you ask her specifically. Avoid if possible. | Please stay away, I'm warning you if you wanna save your GPA. She teaches us like we already know the problems and her method of teaching students is terrible. You know the professor is bad when 90% of the students don't show up and don't know what the material is about. You basically have to self study to pass. | Her accent makes it difficult to want to understand and the material is very boring. For some reason she makes up new variables for things so understanding her work is every more difficult on top of her bad handwriting. She uses slack but apparently ignores it outside of class. QRR are pointless. Hw is short and she is a light grader on tests. | she has changed and becomes a nice professor | heard really bad things about her because of some big problems in the past, but she has def reformed since. the online class was v organized and she'd send out nice messages and reminders for assignments and extensions all the time, such a sweet person and really explains things during lecture. def really cares ab students, easy A for mechatronics | Everything you read here is true, she's the worst. She acts like she is always open for feedback and communication with students but she never responds and is just extremely unhelpful. lectures always fall behind. Eventhough she sucks, the class isnt terribly hard especially if u have taken phys 2 already. Tests are not bad either. Good Luck :') | The worst professor I have had so far. I'd say Hove is 10x better than she is. (that says a lot) If you have the luxury of taking this class online, don't attend the lectures. Just watch recordings on 2x speed and skip over all of the use less stuff she says. Other than that the material isn't hard so you can just teach yourself. Good luck! | Probably one of the worst, if not the worst professors I've ever been taught by. She is super unorganized and all over the place while doing notes. She used several different platforms, canvas, gradescope, slack, and perusall, which makes looking at due dates and assignments a nightmare. If you ask a question be prepared to get condescended. | Only got a C because the final was really hard. Otherwise everything else was super easy. She always wanted feedback for lectures and would make sure we understood everything. There was plenty of reading materials available online too. Overall great prof! | ok so I heard many complain before taking mecht but when I took her it was the yes the best class I ever took not because mechatronics is fun because professor Scacchioli made it fun and enjoyable to learn, if I ever had questions I would stop by her office hr and she would help me if her office hr didn't work I would email her and she helps. | Professor Sccachioli is super sweet and shows that she cares about her students. Lectures can be kinda messy but she's open to feedbacks and will adjust her lectures to better benefit her students throughout the course. I personally found that practicing a lot of different types of questions is helpful to pass this class. | I'm glad to hear that she has gotten better because after Spring 2020, we wrote a 3 page petition detailing all of the ways she screwed up both Mechatronics and Dynamics, and I guess our complaints were heard :) Good luck to all of the students taking her in the future and I hope you learned more than my peers and I did that year. | She explains things not very clearly and her lectures are all over the place. She was unorganized and late to nearly every lecture. The material on its own really is not that bad, but her explanation makes it much more confusing then it is. Nothing pleases me more then knowing I never have to take a class with her again. | This class for me was kind of a waste of time because it is basically just physics. The lectures are okay, but not a lot gets done during them. A lot is unclear, like when the quizzes are and such. I did not have a good time in this class. | A lot of people go in with bad reviews of her but she is an absolute sweetheart. She had very clear grading criteria and provided a lot of opportunities for extra credit. The exams are pretty straight forward in terms of following the class examples and practice problems. | Took her over the summer, she definitely knows the material. Had good explanations when students asked questions and was organized. The homework and quizzes really helped when studying for the exams. You get what you put in. I think she gets a bad rep bc of how long grading takes, but she teaches other classes with barely any TAs to help so. | Professor Scacchioli puts a lot of effort into giving her students as many opportunities to learn as possible. She's very committed to helping her students succeed in her classes and giving them the best learning experience possible. Make sure you know what she's looking for in your work and you'll do fine. | Super unorganized; teaching was a mess, grades ridiculously late, unreasonable amount of work. Work isn't something new in engineering, but there's no reason to have 5 weekly assignments just for the lab alone. She posted grades for some of the exams a month after we took them. She missed the grade due date and actually went back and changed grades | The worst. Do not recommend. Always a mess and the grades for assignments feel random. | Dumbest Professor Ive ever had to learn from. Super unorganized and unclear during lecture. A lot of work for absolutely no reason. | The professor manages her time terribly and chose to teach three chapters in one lecture before the final exam so we can be tested on the material. She is a slow grader and you'll never know you grade until the minute you receive your official grade. She does not allow use of phone or laptops for class, so be prepared to take pictures of the slides | Annalisa will wait until the last minute to grade your assignments and exams. Notes are unorganized and unclear. She will ask for improvement, but will justify why she is teaching well. You basically need to teach yourself in this class. And because she is a tenure professor, she is not going anywhere soon. Good Luck. | You will have a hard time in this course. She does not teach that well, and so you have to be ready to study on your own to help yourself. Takes forever to grade things too, it is really bad. | Studying for the final made me realize how little she taught us. | Just no. Course just repeat physics123124, but a more pain in the a way. Try u best 2 figureout what will be on 3 midterms, which count less than 30% of u grade. | Her lack of preparation has resulted in us cramming an abnormal amount of material in a short time. Even without cramming she isn't great at teaching. | Had her for both dynamics and mechatronics. Just go through the motions, play her little game. She is bad at communicating and AWFUL at being punctual. She gives 30 in lecture assignments so go to lecture. Homeworks are fine and exams (there's like 4 or 5) are relatively easy if you do the posted practice exam the night before by yourself. | @all saying just don't unfortunately you probably have to :C You will probably learn nothing from this class :) | Stay far away. | As you've probably heard from countless others, she's a terrible teacher. Unfortunately, she's the only professor for some required MAE courses. Really wish it wasn't the case. The lab incredibly easy compared to the lectures/hw/exams (you just follow exactly what the TA and instructions say, you could do it mindlessly). | Definitely worst professor ever at Rutgers. Spends 40 minutes, 20 slides doing 1 problem on the board which textbook already answered that perfectly in less than a page. Uploads wrong files on Canvas. Crammed 3 last chapters in the last 2 lectures. Treat you like a high school student. fake smiles. Dont do that to yourself | Three midterms are worth less than all of her QQs, attendance, and participation combined. She cannot hold the attention of her class, a problem in a 300 some-odd person lecture. If you dont pay attention in class, trying to teach yourself the class is virtually impossible because she gives you the bare minimum of study materials. Good luck | Attendance mandatory and worth 10% of the final grade. (with homework and ""Quick Questions"" worth together more than all of the midterm exams combined.) | wow. Hate to be this person but she is prob the worst professor I have ever had. let me list the many reasons why. 1) comes off very rude 2) is not helpful in office hours 3) takes 20 years to grade an exam 4)her lab has nothing to do with in class 5) if you use a different method than the one she is familiar with she will mark you wrong. STAY AWAY | I can't believe I paid to take this, very unprofessional and constantly late to class, did give us a few chances for extra credit, if you have to take a class with her, do it in the summer so you only have to deal with her for a short time. On the upside, she is pretty nice if you take the time to talk to her, but not the best at explaining things | Can't warn you enough not to take her. Hands down the worst experience I've ever had in a classroom or lab and in shock that she still has a position. Mechatronics has the potential to be one of the most crucial MAE classes as you peek into the applications of electronic components but you're stuck following an instruction manual the entire time | NOO | No | I've never met a more unprofessional professor in my time at university. In her office hours she's even more rude then she comes off in class. She isn't capable of teaching a lecture, her notes are so unorganized and her expectations are always unexpected. She complains about doing ""professor things"" that she is paid to do. Run, far far away. | I'd be shocked if you could find a worse professor than Scacch. Avoid her like the plague and if you have to take her, just try to do everything on your own. | JUST DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF. REALLY DON'T. I WARNED YOU FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!!!!!!!! | This professor is the complete opposite of a good professor. Get ready for a fake smile with no answer to greet you when you ask a serious question about the lecture material and pictures of Italy instead of the time on the board when taking exams. This professor is careless and has no idea how to teach. Terrible in every way. | just dont | Like most people can attest to, she's an incredibly nice person! Unfortunately, she can't teach. Here's why: 1) Her accent is very thick. She has difficulty communicating concepts to students because of the language barrier. 2) Her handwriting is awful. Diagrams get messy fast. 3) Can't keep control over a lecture hall. Doesn't finish lectures. | She's incapable of holding a lecture hall's attention. She can't teach, and it's sad. Anytime I actually went to class, I left more confused than when I had come in. I relied on the textbook for this entire class, exams are pretty difficult and her grading is often unfair. My advice, skip class, and do as many practice problems as possible. | horrible. | Annalisa is probably one of the worst professors I've had in my time at Rutgers. Lectures make absolutely no sense, as she just babbles on and gets distracted easily. Hand written notes are totally illegible. Not very understanding when it comes to things going wrong. (ie. missing class, turning in work late) Recommend not taking her. | Incredibly smart professor, issues in the structure of the class, but the material covered is some of the most important engineering concepts for industry applications; TAKE THE COURSE SERIOUSLY, even if everyone around you doesn't, she will help you from the very beginning. | Although she is very sweet in person, she has no control over the class, cannot keep up with her own material and does not know how to explain anything. She takes over 10 pages to solve one homework problem and that makes trying to relearn stuff very difficult. It's an overall maddening course and avoid her if you can."
"Cook Chennault, Kimberly","DELLC Intro to Eng, not 291. Little to no clarification on assignments. Projects started meaninglessly and never followed up. ""Projects"" felt more like arts and crafts than actual engineering assignments (jewelry designing for an all-girls intro to eng class? really? it wasn't even design, it was creating charms to string onto premade necklaces). | Took 440:115(DELLC Intr. to Eng.). She does not care for this class at all. Instructions for the bajillion projects she gives us are unclear. These projects are meaningless and do not even introduce anything abt its respective engineering field, its just busy work she gives us so that the class feels like an actual class. Grades weirdly too. | Exams are very difficult due to time constraints. Errors propagate through in multi-part problems. | Did extremely well with minimal effort (zoned out in basically every class). My secret: I read the textbook, unlike almost everyone else. Prof isn't the best at lecturing anyway (moves through exs too fast, bad at answering qs, etc.), but if you go through the textbook, you'll gain a strong, fundamental understanding that will carry you through. | It is through the hw assignments in this class that I learned to fear rejection. She somehow managed to butcher the same question multiple times on a test. I sacrificed my sleep schedule for this class and it was worth it. If you want to succeed in this class then prepare to spend hours a week studying. | You go from As in HS to Ds in her class if you don't dedicate tons of time to studying and pay attention in every lecture. | I usually hate powerpoints, but she does a good job of going back and forth between using them for the concepts and doing problems in a way that you can understand. She is good about answering questions inside and outside of lecture. She is better than most professors i have had. | I am doing the energy concentration. I have a few classes I can teach, but was not sure about this one. However, i really liked the broad topics covered and her manner of doing it. There were several topics covered and despite the number of topics, Cook-Chennault does a good job of giving you a good overview. She is fair, but tough. | I have had her for two classes and she is amazing. I had her for statics and Alternative Energy Systems. She is good at explaining things and putting information in a context of how you will apply what you learn to a really job. I actually used things I learned in my internship. Exams are like the homework if you do the homework. | Best prof I had at Rutgers | She is knowledgeable and cares about her work, she speaks clearly and gives thorough answers to questions. However, if you miss an assignment for any reason do not expect much consideration even if it is not your fault. | she was actually awesome. I came to this class expecting another boring class with powerpoints and professor who does not give a sh--. uses a lot of powerpoints bu, i actually learned a lot from the class. I talked about stuff i learned from her & the class in an interview and got an internship. So what, you have to work hard - worth it | Can you say powerpoint? But, unlike some profs who do easy problems in class and test you on the hard ones - she actually does hard ones on the board so you can pass the tests. Tests are hard - multiple choice questions (no partial credit) & problem-solving ones (partial credit). She is really tough but fair in grading. | Though she uses powerpoints a lot she takes time to explain topics and really is interested in students learning. She is tough but fair. A lot of people who don't show up to class or follow instructions get mad and complain. They are idiots, really. follow instructions and go to office hours and you will do well. | Lectures consist of slides being read to the class nearly verbatim. Some classes will consist of a short, easy problem being worked over the course of an hour. Requires iclicker. Sometimes struggles to answer questions that go beyond the slides. Tests are about half multiple choice. Class does very poor job showing how cool alt energy topics can be | She's terrible. The exams were unfair and wasn't very helpful either. | Way too much homework, took between 9 and 12 hours a week to complete but did not feel useful at all because exam problems were completely different. No communication outside of lecture, does not respond to emails or show up to her own office hours. | Basically had the same experience as the two people below me. She was definitely the worst professor I've had so far. It took hours to do the homework and I felt like I understood the material. But then she goes and gives exam problems that aren't even possible? Incredibly unfair and she handled the situation terribly. | Had statically indeterminate systems on both of her midterms and never wanted to admit that she made a mistake while making them. I found her rude and unhelpful and it got progressively worse as the course went on. | Both her statics midterms featured physically impossible systems, both of which she did not address. | Dr. C is tough in terms of homework. She gives a lot, but she is available to explain and also gives examples in class. I was clueless at the beginning, but found that if I attended lecture, which can sometimes be boring (powerpoints) - I understood a lot more. She is fair in grading and tries to make things as clear as possible. | She is AWESOME! I was afraid to take her class because she is known for being a powerpoint QUEEN, BUT, she also teaches really well and is always available to answer questions. I want to take another class with her. | Kim is inspirational! I teach both Physics and Overview of Engineering to students at nearby Franklin High School. I love that she gives me and my fellow colleagues in the RURETE program the support and guidance we need to collaboratively and interactively develop hands on, inquiry based, engineering oriented, and student centered lessons. | She was a good lecturer. | Class felt poorly thought out. Topics were loosely connected, some feeling like they were put in due to being required, while everything else wasn't. | One of the best classes I ever had at Rutgers. She is good at answering questions and has definitely put a lot of time into preparing for the class. | teaches only from slides, really boring class. homework and exam problems are directly like examples done in class and in the book. overall easy class, just know how to do all example problems inside out. | A sack of potatoes has more answers than her. | Teacher is terrible. She reminds me of Palin. You ask her a question and she doesn't answer it. She made a system in our class saying we can't ask questions during class, we have to write them on an indext card and she'll address them next class. Probably because she has no idea what she is doing. | chick has no idea what she is doing- if u ask a question he has to look at her notes for ans- i wonder how she got the job - | Very good teacher, has her own method but can explain it well. | the subject matter is kinda hard, but she makes it easier to understand. she is also a real hottie."
"Bottega, William","Professor William Bottega is a strict but highly professional instructor. He sets high standards and expects his students to meet them, which motivates you to push your limits and truly understand the material. His ability to convey complex concepts clearly and his dedication to students' success make his classes invaluable for serious learners. | The entire class consisted of 4 quizzes, homework, a midterm and final, usually the quizzes arent too bad if you understood the homework. I would recommend doing the example problems in the textbook, helped a ton. No calculators, he gives his own cheat sheet, the class was semi difficult but manageable, he curved quite a bit at the end. | this is the most terrible course I had during my four years at Rutgers. His lectures do not make any sense. The exam regulations are highly rigid, with no allowance for calculators or cheat sheets. He expects you to devote an excessive amount of time to this course, as if it were the only class you are currently taking. Avoid him at all cost. | Failed this class and retook it. Very difficult class. Probably the hardest class off of course material I have taken in my 4 yrs. However, exams are fairly graded, and there is a homework solutions doc which can be useful for double checking answers. Advice: go to class, take notes, study. It's supposed to be hard. Good luck. | His Aerospace Structures class was straight up a bad time. He just lectures at you for the duration of the class doing intense derivations and I don't thing a single student follows. Then the tests worth the majority of your grade don't reflect the homework one bit so you don't really have anything to study off of. Would recommend staying clear of! | They say a professor can make or break a subject, and professor Bottega broke, stepped on and destroyed Dynamics. He didn't teach, he copied down his notes on the board and read them out loud. Overall he is a complicated, messy and difficult professor with handwriting that even Morse code professionals will have a hard time deciphering. | Got above average in class and received a ""failing"" grade . He will cover 9+ boards of notes that are almost strictly equations and come time for the exam he will be mad that the class only knows how to plug and chug. Also takes off points for correct answers if you could have observed the answer but did work instead. | Professor Bottega is a nice guy. He normally teaches graduate classes, so teaching Dynamics was a change of pace for him. He spends most of the class time going over proofs and a couple of examples, so you need to be prepared to learn some other things on your own. Easy exams/quizzes, but homework is extremely difficult and long. Ask questions! | Very mean and unfair grader. Does not help anyone. No one ever goes to his office hours. | If you are a super nerd you will enjoy his class, for an average student like me, I was lucky I got a B. His exams are difficult to do even with an open book, enough said | Bottega is a good professor. The book he uses is the one he wrote, so he can always clarify on things. He's pretty easy to talk to, and pretty laid back. Quizzes and exams were tough for the most part, but fair. Whatever was on there, was what he said was going to be on there. No surprises. I'd take another of his classes if I could. Recommend. | This is the second, and last, class I'll have with Bottega. He's my favorite engineering professor. He's very academically demanding and is not afraid to give anyone a low grade for a poor performance. Honestly, Vibrations was my hardest course this semester, but also my favorite. Ask him questions, answer his question, show up to class, and STUDY. | First, I loved Bill Bottega. I know a lot of people weren't huge fans of him, but I enjoyed his class for the most part and ended up with a great grade. Upsides: You almost always know what he expects of you, or it's not very hard to figure out. Downside: there a lot of derivations you waste time with, that may never be used. Great guy and prof! | he was good. I have to say I really enjoyed that class. maybe he's hell in vibrations, but for fluids he's the man | Bottega is underrated. I was terrified of him, but he is so willing to help anyone that asks. He's very intelligent and expects a lot from students, so if you arent willing to do some work don't take him. I thought he was great | Condescending, pompous, and prone to mood swings. Tends to assume students are experts in things they learned years before and is only nice to students that have perfect grades and suck up. | avoid at all costs FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!!!!!! | I passed vibrations w/him and hardly ever went. The kids that failed are the same kids that slipped through the cracks and don't deserve an engineering degree. Take him, he will either show you A) what you are capable of, or B) that you have no business being an engineer. Either way, you will learn some important things about yourself. | callin this guy a **** is being far too generous and nice | He is a def a smart guy, at times little bit of an ****. If your intelligent you ll do okay. No one ever goes to his office hours, so show up once or twice and you ll understand the stuff a lot better then the rest of the class. Oh and he is a tough grader. | ARROGANT as can be. | ""This is the average, it is still an F"" - Need I say more?? | Unless you are an A+ student, STAND CLEAR!!! He has no qualms of failing an Senior. Extremely Arrogant. He is very smart, but maybe too smart. | This guy has ice flowing through his veins. He is nasty in class unless you are one of his favorites. Don't take him. Consider yourself warned. | Excellent teacher, tough subject, see him for extra help, Bottega will make it clear."
"Matlock, Thomas","Seriously, avoid this man at all costs. He has no ability to relay information in a comprehensive manner, his lectures are all over the place. And the lecture slides are just complicated figures taken from I assume some textbooks with very little words to actually describe what the takeaway is. He teaches as if we are already experts on the topics | He's a great professor who wants all of his students to do well. The course material is pretty heavy so going to lecture/recitation will help you do well in the class. Easily one of the most accessible teachers and takes time to answer all of your questions. Heavy emphasis on go to lecture and understand the material. | Professor Leustek genuinely cares about his students, and does his best to make sure that his class benefits everyone. The grading system is fair, and the material is relatively do-able as long as you put in the work required for the class! | One of the best proffessor I've had. He doesn't leave any students behind and is willing to answer questions and clear up confusion during lecture. Not an easy A but an A is possible if you take the time to understand the material, unlike most rutgers science classes where that isn't enough. You need to take notes to do well. record the lecture too | This professor is the sweetest man ever. He can get a little boring but he definitely knows his material. As long as you pay attention in class and take notes the exams are pretty straight forward. But YOU HAVE TO TAKE NOTES. His slides are mostly pictures so you won't do well without paying attention in class. | Worst kind of professor ever. Does not care about his course, did not get through all of the material we were supposed to cover. Made the class really boring and told us it was going to be really boring. Also admitted that he didn't know a lot of the material he was teaching, which made him seem incompetent. Read the textbook even if he says not to | He uses an iclicker for attendance, hes very nice but pretty boring. I reordered the lectures which help because there was absolutely no way I could ACTIVELY pay attention and take notes for the full 80 min. The grading criteria was WONDERFUL tho do well on the first three exams and for the last one (the ""final"") you don't have to take it. | Go to lectures and take notes and you will do fine. Textbook is useful and he provides a PDF of the textbook for you. He's very helpful. Go over iclicker questions and quiz questions for exams. | 4 Exams. Final non-cum. Lowest one dropped. Exams all based on Lectures. Provides textbook for you if you want more clarification. Iclicker's for attendance and some idea of what's on exam. For exams best to know some clicker questions and basic vocab for proteins and enzymes. Quizes have based on news articles, pretty useless. Overall good. | Go to lecture, sit in front, RECORD what he says, ASK questions. If there's one thing I assure you he won't do, it's leave any student behind. 4 Exams, lowest one dropped. Some tricky questions, but most straightforward. Dr. Leustek is truly a great professor! You rarely see caring and hilarious professors such as him. | Can tell he really knows his stuff, but sometimes has difficulty explaining tough concepts. Great guy - very approachable and willing to ELI5 if you ask. Textbook is good reference to clear up details. Exams are tricky, but in-class clicker questions will give you an idea of what they're like. | Dr. Leustek is an excellent professor. I really don't know how anyone could say that he is a bad professor. His lectures are not boring. His exams are very fair. He made me really understand genetics. | He is the BEST PROFESSOR I have had. I know tests can be tough, but he makes sure you understand what he is trying to say in the lectures. He is very, very helpful to his students that he even replies to your questions in the chat room. He really cares for his students. Indeed, a very nice man. | His exams are based on his lectures so don't think you can skip class and just read the textbook. He's not a very good lecturer at all... He's very confusing... He's not sure of what assignments he assigns either! He's a nice man, but if you can, stay away from this professor!!! | Great guy. Class is really memorization, so it gets real boring listening to him read off the slides. He picks really obscure details to put on the exams. Gotta make sure you understand EVERYTHING from the notes. | Exams are from his lectures (can get boring). Going to class makes some exam questions easier even though he teaches from the book. Offers extra credit. Getting an A is achievable. I would recommend this course. | Good class. One of the smartest professors at Rutgers. His notes come straight from the textbook. Exams are straightforward, no tricks. Go to class. Very willing to help you. Presentation may be dry, but he does not go off on tangents. | he's a nice pereson, but a bad teacher. He doesn't explain clearly and his exam is off what he says at the class. I think you have to understand every single words on the book in order to get an A. | im taking his class this spring. hes a nice guy who wants you to learn but he makes me maddddd sleepy. i wish i knew him when i was young...maybe he could have told me some bedtime stories. | Incredibly interesting course, taught in a way that makes sense. | boring as hell. exams are hard | Dr. Leustek is the most boring professor I have ever had. I love genetics but his class makes me want to be a business major. I don't know if he tries to trick you during his tests or if that is the way he really thinks, but they sure are hard. | impossible to stay awake with someone with such a monotone voice... exams are very hard and he tries to trick you on each question. | Dr. Leustek may be a bad teacher (I haven't taken his classes yet), but he is great to work with in the lab. | Couldn't stay awake no matter what I tried. No need to bring a pillow...you'll fall asleep anyway."
"Bennett, Harold","these other reviews are tweaking, guy is the goat and just wants you to try hard. the people that gave bad reviews are salty bc they cant handle reading | Lecture = once a week, 3 hr long, 6-9pm. Quiz @ beginning of every lecture based on content of last lecture + a book question from that chapter. Quizzes arent hard if you pay attention (which is hard to do cause its 3 hours). Attendance is 10% of grade 1 group project where each group is assigned a chapter Reads off slides = wont learn much | doesnt teach you anything only reads off slides if you can memorize slides, youll be okay"
"Rhee, Won-Jong","Had him for Packaging Evaluation Methods. He has just retired, but he was a great professor. Took the full lecture time, but was very respectful to never go over our time and gave long breaks. Told many great stories and cared very much about the department and the students. Unfortunate that the university screwed him over due to his age. | His lectures are long, but he will always teach what is on the exams. Very nice guy thats very passionate about his career. | His grading is 10% attendance, 40% midterm, and 50% final. His grading itself is inconsistent and unfair. Lectures for three hours straight and goes on hour long rants about something meaningless. Struggles to answer questions. Avoid if possible."
"Golden, Martin","Graded on two short oral exams & attendance, that's it. Not super difficult. He was lenient in grading them. Class is just lecture/participation, and sometimes I would get distracted bc of the monotony if I wasn't super interested that particular day. But I still think he's a good lecturer. | I honestly found it kind of hard to connect with the material, and I really wish the grade wasn't just attendance and two verbal exams. That said, I reached out to him for an extra credit opportunity at the end of the semester and he was kind enough to give me a chance to raise my grade. He deserves a lot of credit for that. | TAKE PROFESSOR LIN! the most amazing philosphy prof I've had at rutgers. his class is very discussion heavy but they're extremely interesting so you will actually want to participate. you have to take you're own notes though so you have to pay attention during class. he has 2 grades which are 2 oral exams that are 5 min each. very interesting class | Great. Lecture style that relies heavily on class participation and discussion. I thought it was interesting material, but at times easy to lose focus or get distracted. He's very chill and funny. 2 oral exams which aren't extremely difficult. Attendance matters. I was scared to take this class but now I'm going to miss it. | He's a nice guy but the way he taught this class made it very easy to loose focus. If you don't know/understand the readings you'll be absolutely lost in this class. Mostly graded on attendance, every absence will reduce your grade so make sure you show up. Midterm and final are both 10 min. oral exams so easy for the most part but very boring. | You are graded by four things, your final paper, midterm, outline, and class participation. His lectures are really fun, especially to participate in. There is a textbook that's about $20, but you can find it online. | He's so sweet and once he warms up to the class, he's really funny too! My class a healthy mix of lecture and discussion, but make sure to do the reading before class. | Lin is a super nice guy, knows what his talking about, but the material is a little abstract and difficult. Only 3 tests and you do not really need to read the textbook because he provides a study guide with all the questions before the tests! | For the entire class he has a discussion based upon slides that he puts up on the board. Slides are also online. If you participate in the conversation you are more likely to understand so being active matters. He recommends a textbook but I did not use it unless studying. He only gives three exams that are worth 90% the rest is participation. | Martin's super chill, his slides are online, and he basically gives you the exam before you take it. There's no homework but he grades kinda harsh and didnt round my 89.7 up to an A. I would definitely recommend him if you want to take an easy class, but he's not great at answering questions. | I took Spinoza with Professor Lin as well as Honors existentialism in philosophy literature and film. He is a very kind professor. You need to read, but he will explain the nuances of the readings incredibly thoroughly and well. He has a wonderful sense of humor, although I don't recommend taking his classes if you are not interested in philosophy. | Prof Lin is awesome! This class requires reading, & although the readings can be super confusing he always encourages you to ask questions and participate. There are 3 papers and he gives feedback for 2 of them. The class itself is slightly challenging, but it is a seminar so we mostly discuss what we read/watch. He is an easy grader, def recommend | Awesome professor. Fun to listen to, easy tester-- do the readings so that you aren't lost in class. He has a lot of interesting things to say, so don't space out just because you're in college... Grading really is dependent on the T.A -- Lucy Jordan is a VERY good one. Do the work, and you'll do just fine. | Professor Lin is a really cool guy who opens up the floor for discussion during his lectures. He introduces some great thought experiments and he is also really funny. Attendance is not mandatory but it is very entertaining if you are engaged in the lecture material. | Existentialism is an awesome and interesting course to take. Keep in mind that your grade is based off a midterm and a final so know your stuff and don't be bored. That being said, Lin is an incredible professor and just listening to him, you know that he knows his stuff. One of the best profs i've ever had. | I was amazed about the amount of stuff he knew. If someone in class came up with the weirdest most abstract question, he would flip it somehow using his extensive knowledge. Attendance isn't mandatory but it really helps when he explains the works in class because that's what he's looking for on the test. Only 2 exams which he gives a study sheet | He is a very laid back down to earth professor and also VERY CUTE!! Class discussions are very involving and interesting. | Prof Lin is the best. The lectures may get a little bit long, but he definitely explains the textbook readings and always made class humorous. I would definitely recommend taking a class with him. | this class is a good class if your willing to do the work. you def. don't need to go to the lectures to do well, the TA's are who really help you and reading the chapters before going to lecture is very helpful. Professor Linn is a really down to earth, funny guy and he basically just explains what the chapters are about. Take this class i got an A | i really liked prof lin. he's very down to earth and is willing to spend as much time on a topic until we understand it--even though it's a lecture. i highly recommend taking 104 instead of 103 because the TAs help a LOT. he may not always be prepared for class, but he knows his material. i went to class and did the readings and i got an A. | He's a cool guy with a great sense of humor but going to lecture is absolutely pointless. He definitely does NOT make the subject interesting, and in philosophy, it's VERY important for a professor to do so. You really need to read the textbook, and like, actually read it, not skim through the chapters if you want to do good in this class. | I am forced to disagree with the previous contributor. Dr. Lin is very knowledgable and articulate; In addition, he has a good sense of humor and is very laid-back. He sticks to the text book rather faithfully and often offers his own insight and opinion. Reading the book is definately essential, hes not their to hold your hand. Good teacher | I don't like him. His lectures are soooo boring and he never gets indepth into the material. Reading the textbook is a must if you want to survive. He gives Rutgers Philosophy department a bad name. | No Comments"
"Santos, Patricia",The Worst and meanest professors i have ever had.
"Schmitz, Guido","Hes such an amazing teacher!! I took him for Film Aesthetics in Fall 2017 and hes absolutely amazing! Hes really passionate about film, so his lectures and videos are pretty great. There is only one test, which is the Final Exam, and if you pass all your homework and receive a total of 10 points each, you dont even need to take it. | He is a great professor, I enjoyed his class and he made it fun. He worked with you until you were able to pronounce the words correctly, if you didn't understand something he explained it until you understood it. He selects on students randomly to read or answer questions so be ready. Had 3 of each oral and written exams, he gives study sheets. | learned so much and loved Guido's teaching style, he's extremely laid back, hilarious, and understanding. So insightful learning from a native Italian, learning the do's and don'ts of the culture. Weekly hw assignments to complete and one major project to do. Only 3 exams and no quizzes, so take the time to study for the exams. Take this class! | Did not care for him at all. Grading system was extremely subjective... our final was an oral test that we had to do in front of other students. He looked at everyone and said their final grades out loud... told me I got a C because I was of Italian heritage and didn't know Italian by the end of his class. | Great teacher. He is a native italian. Very understanding because he had to earn english. Goes very slow through the book. Focuses on convo. skills but not really in front of the class. Easy A just show up and use flash cards. | Awesome Teacher. Listen and do the homework and you will do just fine | Awesome teacher! I was always interested in Italian and Prof. Santi made it easy to learn. I got a little behind near the end but he gave me till the end of the semester to catch up. RECCOMEND!!! | I always wanted to learn Italian and since they open again the course at coc i rapidly add myself. ths class is worth if you really want to learn Italian ! the teacher is great, he is very helpful and besides the book we learn more things that he knowswill be useful for us!! one of my best teachers ever ."
"Rosenberg, Eric","Can be a bit unclear at times in lecture but he's always looking for feedback to improve his teaching methods and loves hearing from his students. Attend class, pay attention, ask questions and you'll do just fine. He's a great guy really looking to help his students out with the material, just be sure to meet him halfway with effort from your end. | I would avoid him. He teaches simple things in a complicated way and expects students to know the complicated way. Sometimes he seems to be confused himself. Will never take it again. He has no requirements for projects and gives all the students C explaining it did not meet the requirement. Very unorganized class."
"Guo, Weihong","She didn't necessarily explain things well to me. Prior knowledge of R will go a long way in this class. I learnt more from my friend than I did from her. Make sure to have helpful group members for the project because its heavily graded | The amount of work she assigned was more than my other 4 engineering classes combined. I think most of the class used certain online resources because nobody has time to spend 10 hours on weekly homework that were just going to get a 60% or less on. Highly recommend finding an alternative equivalent course in the Math Dept or another school. | She's not a very helpful teacher. If you have no prior knowledge of Data Analytics, you will struggle. Her R codes didn't always work for me. I had to seek help from a friend. I was so eager to learn about Data Analytics. After taking her class, I'm very uninterested about the skill. It was a kill-joy. | She doesn't teach instead shows her slides and tries to speak reading off of the slides. Very weak teaching skills and too lazy to make improvements. projects are jokes. she is clueless about facility design. | This professor is hard to understand- especially during online meetings. She has nice slides but speaks poorly. Mediocre in teaching. Easy grader though- gives highest grades to everyone !!! Didn't learn very much !!! She simply tries to ""buy"" better student ratings. I was excited to take this subject but I am disappointed !!! | Would not recommend Guo . Had her for this grad class, she was kind to her own student but rather rude to others. Instead of teaching simulation she showed unrelated subjects. Grading isn't fair as you lose chunks of points for simple mistakes. Unhelpful and unapproachable. | Dr. Guo is a very sweet person and takes her job seriously. She seems determined for all of us to learn statistics. However, her class demands a lot of time commitment and her lectures are fast-paced and very boring. Homework takes quite some time but exams are fair with no surprises. She was always at her office hours and was of decent help. | Where do I begin about this professor? She is such a nice and wonderful person but I was unable to understand or pay attention to her lectures. Her slides are easy to follow though and exams are not too bad as long as you study and make a good cheat sheet. | Grace Guo cares about her students and will go the extra mile to make sure her students are well prepared for the exams. She genuinely wants her students to succeed. She is very passionate about statistics and I hope she continues to teach."
"Wicks, Elin","She genuinely wants to ensure you leave with a better sense of finance than you entered with. Extremely easy class overall. | Typically two lectures where most of the time is spent working on practice problems that are similar to what is on the test, so you know what to expect. Material is not hard at all and Wicks is very good at explaining the concepts, as well as answering student questions. | Nice and great professor, but lectures could get boring at some points making it difficult to focus. She provided lots of practice materials for exams, and her exams included extra credit. She also provides lots of help of students. | Dr. Wicks is passionate about teaching and wants all her students to succeed. Engineering Economics was the easiest class I've ever taken; I ended with a 102%. No stress at all. You can miss up to four classes throughout the semester without losing credit for attendance. There's very little homework as well. | Professor is nice and cares about students. Course material is easy as long as you come to lecture, skipping out on lecture may cause you to fall behind. No final exam | Really nice prof, as long as you go to the lecture and follow her on the lecture, you will be a great shape in the final, and the TAs are very helpful, don't hesitate, ask them if you got confused. And she won't give crazy HW, probably only took 1-2 hours to finish it. | The course was useless. Dr. Wicks is boring. I wish it was not required. | Professor Wicks was amazing. Even though the class had almost 200 kids, she made it feel comfortable to speak out loud and ask questions. Lectures are very laid back and the topics are extremely easy. Overall she is a very sweet woman and genuinely interested in her profession. | Prof. Wicks is great. Attendance is mandatory, but lectures are engaging and she explains the material very well. In-class exercises are due after class period, and help prepare you for exams. Exams are very straightforward and she gives partial credit. Overall, one of the best professors I've had! Def take her class for Eng. Econ. | Amazing professor! She has very engaging and enjoyable lectures and concisely explains the topics that are taught. The assignments that follow and the exams are straight forward and match what is taught in lecture. Excellent professor. | Wicks is a great professor, she has been teaching this class for a long time and has it down to (almost) a science. There were some strange changes this year like assigned seating in lectures that weren't great, but she's very helpful and you will easily learn the material from her if you pay a modest amount of attention in class. She is great! | She was one of the best professors that I've taken so far. She structures the class so that attendance is mandatory, but she uses the lecture time to explain the concepts well. She also includes many group activities to reinforce the material. The exams themselves were easy, and she's lenient when it comes to grading. | She is a great prof. I am not really good at econ but she made it good. Dont know that it makes sense but take her!!! She is great, and she helps a lot. | Great teacher great class if you do well you can skip the final just do the HW and the class is easy | Took for engineering econ. Lectures were a little boring, only because the content is quite easy, but she is super caring and understanding. All of her class policies are very reasonable. Exams are easy. A really nice person. | Inconsiderate and rude, take ur chances with someone else. | Dr. Wicks is the best. Its a shame she only teaches econ, I wish I had her for other courses! She is super accommodating & organized. She has this class setup perfectly. She clearly is passionate about what she teaches and she cares for everyone's success. Do the HW, go to class & this will be a breeze. | Prof Wicks is a fantastic prof. She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She explains the concepts very well in lecture and prepares you for the exams. She also offers a ton of extra credit opportunities. Highly recommend taking her if you can | She is an AMAZING lady and professor. Everything is very organized. Lectures are recorded. Too many assignments but easy and keeps you on track. Always accessible out of class. Very generous with extra credit. You will love her, very recommended. | Professor Wicks is cracked as a professor. All the material that anybody would ever need for her course is laid out on the Canvas. At least for Engineering Economics, the two lecture-per-week format where you would learn on the first lecture and practice on the second lecture means that you basically have to not do anything to do bad. 10/10 | Helped me take a midterm at a different time when I couldn't attend the initial time. Lots of the content is extremely easy, with 2 difficult portions. For the most part, if you do your hw, and pay attention to even half the lecture you'll get an A. | She does her best to teach economics to a group of engineers who have little to no interest in it. Classes felt long sometimes, but she did make the material easy. Especially as a gen ed requirement the work wasn't overwhelming. | Tries to simplify everything as much as she can. Just do all the in-class assignments and hw. Very helpful on assignments and exams. I doubt anyone pays attention during lecture because material is very easy to understand by looking at her slides. DO NOT buy the textbook. You won't use it. Do the work and you get exempt from final. | Amazing professor, is always willing to help students. Many resources to help pass the course. Has a lot of in class assignments, and hw. If you study her practice exam, you should be fine with the exam. Very easy course. | Best professor in the engineering department! Engineering Economics is such an easy A and Dr. Wicks does a great job in explaining and making sure students understand. Weekly assignments and homeworks but is not alot and you get multiple tries. Take her! | Professor wicks is amazing! She really cares for her students, as long as you do assigned work should be able to pass with an A | I am in this class b/c my major requires it. Otherwise the class is a total waste of time and money. I get no bang for the buck. Stuff is way too easy for us engineers. I'd rather design something cool. Literally Dr. Wicks begs to be recognized and promoted by students. | Professor Wicks is amazing! She's very sweet and considerate. Her lectures went at a moderate pace and were helpful for work. She answered any questions students had and there were always opportunities to improve your grade. The class is very fair. If you put in the work, you will do very well due to the grade distribution. | Absolutely fantastic to have, even for 8:30's. Super straightforward class, very easy to manage. Tests were simple and the homework was very manageable. | Easiest course ever. | Professor Wicks is one of the only shining stars in the Rutgers ISE department. I actually felt inspired and motivated to do better in her class due to her teaching style and how much she cares about her students. Her classes aren't easy but she is very willing to help you learn if you don't understand something. I wish I had more classes with her. | super sweet prof and eng econ was an easy easy A. She's very helpful too if you're confused by anything, and makes very fair exams | Very nice. She allowed late work pretty much up until the final. There were plenty of opportunities to improve grades and extra credit. The exams were kind of hard but I think it was just me. She is very friendly and includes pets/animals in every lecture! I will definitely not forget her | she makes you work for your grade get ready to put in some time for HW and prepare for test caz they are straightforward but you must know your material. don't dare to cheat you will get caught 100%. but she is willing to help all the students if they are confused if you pay attention in class you will be fine. | She's really friendly, the tests are super straightforward- right out of the lecture material. Heavy HW sets though, but she's always at office hours | Dr. Wicks is literally one of the best ISE professors. I had her for Engineering Econ as well in a previous semester and even then she worked super had to make as many students as possible got an A. Work design is not a difficult class, as long as you keep up with assignments and have a general idea of what's going on in the class, you'll be fine. | Omg she's so nice! One of the best professors ive had at Rutgers. She actually cares about her students and makes an effort to get to know them. She is also helpful over email and replies quickly. The homework questions were sometimes difficult, but exams are pretty straightforward. do the practice exams and re-do the homeworks, and youll be fine | I'm generally not strong when it comes to economics but Professor Wicks made the course materials simple and super easy to understand. She's very clear when lecturing and is committed to help her students succeed. Exams are straightforward and aligns with what she teaches in class. One of my favorite professors at Rutgers :) | Prof Wicks is really doing her best to help students. She goes over the material multiple times and spends days just reviewing last lecture when it seems we're struggling The HW is annoying though the online matlab service you have to pay for. Gives alot of partial credit on exams. You must do the in class assignments ( worth alot) . | Easy class, good prof. | Her class is really easy and she's also very nice. Answers all questions and makes the tests as straightforward as possible. She posts lectures and notes online as well. I just dislike econ as a subject but prof is great. | Wicks teaches quite well and prepares you for the exams, but the HW is too hard. I found the subject dry, but she tried to make it interesting. Attend class so that you can do the inclass assignments. Some classes she would dedicate to practice only. Small project at the end in assigned groups. She seems always willing to help, so take advantage. | The homework was tough but there's always other method to find solutions out there, the exams are very straight forward (non-commutative). There a small group project that counts as homework and make sure to show up to class since there are in class assignments. | She is fairly decent at lectures, and she really cares about the quality of the course and making sure that all students are doing well. Homework is a grind at times but is not that bad overall. Exams are very straightforward and similar to the practice exams. | Very good teacher. Content is well present and interesting. It's not really mandatory to go to every lecture though in class activities that are graded so try not to skip. Exams are just like the practice exams she provides. Homework is difficult and counts for 25% of your grade so don't slack off. If you follow this it's a pretty easy A."
"Xi, Zhimin","The entire semester was 95% theoretical and the professor exclusively read off of the slides. All the homework assignments were graded extremely harshly, with the final being worth 40% of your grade. Although 95% of class time was spent on theoretical concepts, only 30% of the exam was dedicated to theoretical multiple-choice questions. | Class was a joke, Xi can't teach or explain. He made mistakes in the examples he did on the board. Lecture slides and problems are copied straight from the book. Attendance is only marked as EC. Cheating went on during exams and he didn't even care. Lecture was barely related to lab. Gave a 10 minute break halfway through which was nice of him. | I would say he is pretty mediocre;teaches from some random notes and just reads off of them. He doesn't workout any problems. I did well, but I wouldn't take any class with him again."
"Jafari, Mohsen","Jafari is an unfair grader for the Senior Design course. No clear grading criteria, doesn't provide good feedback, only likes certain students, is inconsiderate. No one learns anything in the course cause you and the group have to figure out everything on your own and his feedback is irrelevant and not helpful. | If I had advice to myself as a freshman it would be don't bother with ISE because faculty like him will make your life miserable. Never gave us clear grading criteria, had clear class favorites that he offered extra credit to, didn't even know our names after spending 2 semesters with us and barely understood our projects... ruined my senior year! | Go to class and participate so he knows your face. Material isn't difficult and he explains everything clearly. | Ridiculous grader. There were typos on almost every single powerpoint slide in lecture. He made the textbook not required, but all the HW WAS FROM THE TEXTBOOK. Class was somewhat interesting, but all topics were not covered on exams and in lab."
"Albin, Susan","Dr. Albin is a wonderful professor who truly cares for each one of her students. She gives her best to make sure that she dedicates time to the students who need it and is friendly and supportive no matter how simple the question. iClickers are a must do as the points total up to a significant portion of your grade. | A very intelligent and friendly professor. But, she lectures with too much excitement. First half of class is spent with the lecture and iclickers, then the second half is spent in groupwork (you can't choose) and worksheets. Homework is to finish the worksheets and do textbook problems. | Professor Albin is absolutely adorable. She really tries hard to make sure everyone in the class understands what is going on. Powerpoint can be a bit confusing at times due to some mistakes, but overall a great professor. She will listen to any feedback you have as well and is super approachable. Join the optional study group! it was super helpful | Professor Albin's lectures are extremely confusing. She has clickers so you have to go to class and only drops the lowest two. Her lectures are literally useless for the exams and homework. Her homework is long and tedious but she only skims it so it is easy enough to copy someone else's. Group work is part of the class and she assigns groups. | Professor Albin is a tough grader. She explains the material pretty ok, but once exams come around, they can be a bit confusing. She let's you do group exercises to help grasp the material, but once you take the exam it seems like all is forgotten because the wording of them makes them difficult. I barely passed the class. iclickers and hw helped | Terrible professor. Will not take courses with her again. | Adorable professor! Go to class, and pay attention, and you'll do well. Study hard for the exams, as they can be kind of long. She helps you understand the material during lectures. The iClickers really helped me understand the topics so much! I wish all professors were like Dr. Albin. I highly recommend her. | Avoid this professor at all costs! Her exams are difficult and she doesn't give any of partial credit. Good luck with her if you have her. | She teaches well and her exams aren't that hard. What other students might not know is that she is actually a very well known and recognized contributer to the Industrial Engineering world. Too bad she doesn't share too much about that side of her during this class. | Course has a very very slow pace. Also harder the other stats classes. Seems like her exams are on unimportant, confusing things too. | You will enjoy this class. She has a great teaching technique that makes learning fast and easy, and i hear most people do well on the final. Down to earth, i strongly recomend her for your teacher in this course. | Very good teacher. Takes time to help and explain during office hours if needed. Very helpful in doing research on grad school. Very Nice woman!!! | SLOW LECTURES... talks to you like ur in pre-k... nice and kind lady IF you are on her good side... make sure u dun do something stupid like cheat or ur gunna pay a visit to bernath"
"Ozel, Tugrul","I showed up to his office to talk about a homework assignment, and he cut me off twice; and when he finally did let me speak, his response to my question was, ""Did you even read the assignment?"". Extremely rude. Students show up during office hours to ask for help, and he ignores all concerns. You can tell all he cares about is his research. | Professor Ozel's course helped me grow intellectually by introducing me to new ideas in Automation & Artificial Intelligence Mfg., challenged me to think critically and creatively about complex problems, and giving me opportunities to apply my learning. His clear explanations helped me build a solid foundation of knowledge and abilities. | Contrary to popular belief, I found Prof. Ozel extremely helpful, caring and intricate towards explaining difficult assignments. Lectures may get overwhelming, and the course is difficult, but the fact that the Prof. himself looks after the progress of students makes up for all negative aspects. He's flexible with assignment deadlines as well. | Professors behavior is rude, arrogant and not professional. He doesn't answer questions (telling students he didn't have time or ignoring them). Laughs at students during exams, and also calls out individual students on their poor exam grades. Averages in the class were extremely low. Exams were ridden with errors or missing information. | professor arranges examples and goes over solutions which I found helpful. The course is intense and overwhelming at times. Canvas is full of problems and examples. He prepares good formula sheets and posts before exams. unfortunately some are unhappy since the course material is more difficult than expected. More preparation is definitely needed. | He is quite literally the worst professor I have had in my entire academic career and by a far margin too. He just reads off the slides, he doesn't give good review problems, his exams are very hard and unfair, and to top it off he is very rude. Good luck if you have this professor. | Quite literally one of the worst professors I have ever interacted with during my Rutgers career. My class told him we needed extra help for the exams and his response was to berate us and tell us we're not good enough. Very unsupportive and would laugh at you if you told him you were struggling. Refused to answer questions during lecture or exams | He doesn't answer questions in class and will berate you for asking in the first place. He doesn't give you a lot of resources to help yourself and the ones he does are unclear. He also takes attendance and if you email him he'll just reply with his attendance policy which is 5% off your final grade for missing 2 classes | Unfortunately, Professor Ozel simply reads off his slides for lecture. I don't doubt that he is an expert in his field but attending his lectures is a struggle at best. Grading is extremely ruthless and little time is given on quizzes, no partial credit at all from what I've seen. Good luck to all future ISE students, there's no getting out of this | He works out super clear and relevant examples in class so definitely pay attention to those. It's a lot of material but he's super helpful and caring and is definitley willing to help his students out and gave us good formula sheets for exams. | Don't listen to these complainers, Dr. Ozel is a very good professor. Yes, he takes attendance twice and he covers a lot of material from the textbook. But he makes you work for the grade. I would not say he is easy but he is fair. | Professor Ozel is one of the best professor I have ever had at my master's degree. He genuinely cares about you and he wants you to succeed in life. His class is really interesting as well. | production course was hard and notes required reviewing. homework problems were difficult and time consuming but made me learn the subject. professor did a good job presenting course material and explaining with real-life examples he worked out on the board. at the end the grades were curved and i received a well-deserved A :) | Ozel literally copied the textbook onto the board. Checked attendance twice. Homework was impossible. All grading was arbitrary: points were taken off without explanation. Class was too early in the morning and he'd give us attitude and insult us at that time. Can be nice when you speak about non-class things, but overall difficult to interact with | Grades fairly, teaches well. I have taken two classes with him and done well. | production is enjoyable and professor is great.. lectures are well organized.. I learnt great deal in his class.. | One of the worst professors in the department. Does not know how to teach at all. Thinks reading off his very poorly written slides is effective learning. And then he assigns a bunch of homework that literally no one can understand. Told students that they probably won't graduate because of this class. | Dr. Ozel was very fair and dedicated teacher. He always came class prepared and taught the subject genuinely. He is one of the best professors in the entire engineering department. | PowerPoint reader, grades too hard | His lectures are very clear and his excitements keep me interested in the topic even though the course is difficult. I'd say this is the most relevant course when considering industrial processes. | Highly relevant material for my career in advanced manufacturing | The professor taught the class very well. The review paper and the project helped me learn interesting aspects about advanced processes. I can see how relevant my experience was for my career. I recommend the course for all interested in manufacturing. | Very knowledgable. Put together good PPTs before the class. My class was small so we only had to do a project and term paper, no midterm or final. Willing to help you if needed. As long as you do your work and have some interest you should be fine. | No Comments | Lectures are hard to get through, but he is probably one of the most helpful professors in the entire engineering department. Very nice guy. | I learned great deal from this professor. He made me interested in automation and control. Kind and fair. | He is a dedicated teacher. He knows his material and helps students in understanding and solving the problems."
"Elsayed, E","don't take him if you can find a way to take an equivalent course. Save yourself time, you won't learn in his course | Simply put - a terrible, egotistical professor !!! | The grading for this class is not very clear. Myself and others had an 85 class average going into the final and we got Cs or Ds. Also, he assigns 1-2 hour long homework due every single class. Take this class elsewhere and transfer it in if you can | This class isn't difficult, but it's essentially a self-study course. His lectures involve reading off the slides, so you can save yourself time by going over the lecture slides and relevant textbook passages on your own time. One advantage of going to class is that he lets you know ahead of time what questions will be asked on quizzes and exams. | His lectures aren't clear, but he makes himself available for office hours. He graded on a curve and when people were doing bad, he asked if we wanted more or less quizzes, and sometimes even changed the grade distributions to benefit students. Would I take him again? No, that class was awful. But I don't think he is as bad as everyone says he is. | he is so bad, i wanna give him a zero. but that's not possible, so i give him a one. way too much homework, he is never clear during lectures, expects everyone to know everything immediately. the canvas page is also extremely unorganized. he does not communicate clearly with students. if engineering probability is required for you, good luck. | Terrible professor. It was already hard for the students and professors last semester. But jeez, talk about a bad professor. The material was hard enough but manageable if a good professor would have. He's on sabbatical this year thankfully. | Average on first midterm was a 30% and quiz averages would be lower than 50%. With these averages he still blames the student rather than his poor teaching skills (just reads off of slides). The Hw he gives is quite tedious and the test/quizzes are substantially harder than the hw. Will forever give me PTSD when reflecting on my college experience | If this class is mandatory for you, I strongly suggest considering transferring schools, by far the worst professor I have ever had, you will be assessed on material that you are never taught, and always makes sure to blame the students rather than his teaching skills, I wish you luck if you come across him because he will make you go through hell. | HW comes from the textbook and is tedious and repetitive but he writes all of the exams and quizzes which are much are much more difficult; will make mistakes on the lecture slides and then send spam emails to revise each slide after. worst. class. ever. | I can pretty comfortably say he's one of the worst professors I've ever encountered- and anyone that's experienced the Math department at RU knows that's saying a lot. He'll ask you about your opinion on his teaching style and course material, but if you complain he'll list every reason why you're wrong and a terrible student why he's the best. | Clueless professor has no clue what he is doing. The saying those who cant do teach applies hear. Run don't walk away from his class. | I would rather transfer to another school then take a class with him again | Just a total shambolic professor - he's utterly clueless on how to get projects off the ground, and pretends he's your CEO. Just take his course (since it's mandatory), get it over with, and move on ... He's really uninspirational and just ... horrid | horrible professor | Extremely helpful and intelligent professor when you go to him for help. Be prepared to work hard, as you cannot slack off in his class. Just do your work correctly and you will have no problems with the class. | Groups are assigned an extremely advanced project with his desired deliverables being mostly unrealistic due to budget, time, and knowledge constraints. Thinks he's a hero for making students his slaves while using them to boost his reputation. Extremely discouraging and unsupportive. | He is quite possibly the source for all discouragement, though he ironically carries an aura of inspiration around him. He lacks consistency, though his clarity at any point in time is absolute. Whether you take him seriously is done out of your own volition - whether he takes you serious is equally up in the air. | Cares a lot about his student's success in life and in the classroom. Dont skip his class! | Great Professor. Very clear and very helpfull. If you show intrest, he will help you. Dr. Elsayed knows what he's talking about. Take this guy and learn from his advice & corrections. | No Comments"
"Fabris, Laura","angel of a professor. Lectures aren't too hard, but if you are confused she will take the time to explain in or out of class. very relaxed and pretty understanding. really seems to care abt students, took the time to help me decide what direction in engineering i wanted to go | Very nice and personable, wants students to try hard and will push participation early in the morning. Very knowledgeable of both school subject and major as a whole. Took time out to describe future in subject. Recommend highly | Really nice professor, exams straight from notes. No need for book. Attendance mandatory. Most approachable professor as she is young and understands us the most. | I love her. She's my favorite teacher thus far at Rutgers, because she treats everyone well. Exams are okay, just outline her lecture slides. No book required, everything you need to know on the exam is in the lecture slides. Attendance is mandatory, it counts as a grade. I just really like her, and look forward to taking more of her classes. | Got to office hrs!!!!"
"Safari, Ahmad","I've never hated a class more in my student career and I'm STEM at rutgers lmao. Heavy accent can be hard to understand, especially since the coursework is confusing. There's no real textbook, you basically have to memorize ALL the information on his slides( it's alot). Doesn't take suggestions, very condescending unless you're his fav | Besides the heavy accent, Safari is a great lecturer. Quizzes every week and exams are based entirely off of lectures and model buildings, no surprises. Would definitely take a class taught by him again. | This guy ruined my life. He is very unclear with a heavy accent. He also expects us to know everything without lecturing properly or assigning a good textbook. This class is hard but he makes it even harder. | Nice guy, kind of hard to understand at times. Will call out students he considers ""lazy"". Few friends said they had trouble getting info during office hours. Lectures can drone on a bit and be overly complicated, kit building is interesting but carrying the kit between classes was hassle. Don't understand why things had to be built at home | The subject can be confusing and it's easy to get lost following Dr Safari's course. That being said, if you put an honest effort into this class you will do well. The negative comments here are rather undeserved. Above all Dr Safari respects only one thing: HARD WORK! If you work hard then you will do well and have no issues with him or the course | No book needed. I was afraid of this class cus of the previous ratings, I was pleased. He's a really nice guy, he's intimidating at first, but he grows on you. Fair grader, A LOT of extra credit, and he likes to get to know people. Quizzes are hard, at first, but then you learn his method of testing... Really isn't a bad class. Labs are eh. | He Is Awesome, Plain and Simple. | The labs are fun, but the class consists of a lot of memorization. Dr. Safari is a really cool guy. His lectures are engaging and his accent is awesome. | Lectures are boring,explanations aren't too good, he is not specific at all as to what he will put on the exams, but the quizzes in lab are easy once you know what he expects, he plays favorites, and little things bother him. | All slides. Study and memorize a lot! Nice teacher though, if he sees that you try. Has personality, so can keep interest most of time. Labs are fun. | Good teacher during class. You get to build awesome models during labs. I wouldn't recommend going to Office Hours unless you need to brown nose, even then I doubt that Safari will care. GO TO CLASS. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. It is really easy stuff to study but there is a lot of it. Put at least two hours each week into study and you will be fine. | This teacher makes me wish I was living a worse-off life just so I wouldn't be priveledged to go to this college, JUST so I would NEVER have to experience this disgusting excuse for a class, taught by what is most certainly, at the very least, an android robot zombie, who's only goal is to eat our freakin' brains and destroy our will to learn... | Could be the biggest waste of time of my life. Safari is a lousy teacher, he teaches a boring subject, and frankly, I think the only thing worse than him is the holocaust. | This teacher is awful. He is incredibly unclear. He doesn't listen to questions carefully when students ask, so he just says something unrelated in response to questions. Worst of all, he doesn't gauge whether students are understanding the material, he just goes through the notes and considers his job done. WAY TO MUCH MEMORIZATION. | Absolutely one of the worst, condescending, holier-than-thou, unapproachable, uncaring ""humans"" I've ever had the displeasure of ""learning"" from. I think he's an alien. I really do. | Horrible. barely teaches, does a horrible job explaining anything off of the notes. The class would have been given worse if it weren't for the TA's. Way to strict, expects us to know everything. I can't wait for this class to be over. | Whoa! Where do i begin! I guess the best way to put it is that if Dr. Safari had a soul, he just might be a decent lecturer. The man thinks he is the second coming of Christ. No joke. He doesnt listen to students comments regarding the best way to run the class. Too big of an ego. Mr. Safai = not a cool guy. I hope this is somewhat helpful. | horrible experience. he'll try to screw you any way he can. suggestions: just be cooperative and never sleep in class, don't disagree with him, raise your hand, always attend, etc... | This guy is a ****. | No Comments"
"Riman, Richard","If I had to do it over again, I would take electives till another prof is available. Lectures consist of reading off a large Word doc. However, Word doesn't handle pictures well and it would be better if he used slides. The class is hard since homework is a small percent and tests are the rest, if you fail the first test, its pretty much over. | He just read off a word document during class and it was really hard to learn from that. The tests are also your whole grade and there's no partial credit so if you make one small mistake it could cost you a lot. I didn't learn much from lecture but after doing the homework things started to make sense. I wouldn't take any other class he teaches. | Super straightforward with his notes and teaching. Very time-efficient and usually ends class early. Tests are super fair and straight from the homework. He was also very accomodating for the switch to online. One test was unexpectedly hard for most of us, so he gave a generous curve to it even after mentioning this class came with no curves. | Acts more as a friend than as a professor with his students. Is not arrogant. Also, he improvised makeup exams when our grades struggled. If you are nice with him and take this class seriously, he is very genuine, caring and tries to help you out. But if you appear not interested the class/entitled, he will not give you favors and acts coldly. | Best professor I've ever had. hands down. Hand him for two classes and I wish I could have him for the rest! Truly a great guy, I wish he could adopt me. He has definitely helped me educationally and personally. AMAZING | Best professor I've ever had. He's straight up and wants everyone to pass. He helps but doesn't hand hold you throughout the whole semester. The coursework is easy, simple math and logic. Just DO THE HW, his exams come straight from the textbook and/or notes. and again, PEE1 IS EASY. | Pretty simple A, just do what he asks you to do regarding the only thing you get graded on: a semester long group project. He's not a bad dude, more of ""this is how life is"" kinda guy that might brush you the wrong way. Wasn't a problem for me though. Do what you need to do regarding your project and you'll get the A. | I had him for Design Thinking Innovation. Honestly, the class was an easy A. It feels like he's there just to get paid and would give everyone an A if he could. It's an easy A if you simply do what he asks, which isn't much. The class is pretty much one big group project + presentation. No midterm/final. A bit boring at times but really easy. | Really learned a lot in this class - tech is not only electronic gadgets but involves a whole lot more. Great course for scientists/engineers who want to learn how they can use entrepreneurship as a way for their research to have large impact on society. | Prof. Mammone's Technology Entrepreneurship class was interesting and insightful, it opened up an avenue to entrepreneurship based on scientific and entrepreneurial talent that I was not aware of. He took us through the mechanics of starting successful high tech companies. Want to build the next Google or Facebook? Take this class! | Good prof. for this graduate course. He knows the subject, takes a practical approach, & grades fairly. Exams are similar to the homework. The book was not good - too much abstract theory. But Mammone saw the problem and spent the next lecture explaining the math in understandable terms. Calculators are ok and he does curve if necessary. | Pay close attention to his notes and hw because the exams are exactly questions from hw and exams but numbers are just changed. Good profesor and helpful. | .. | Very nice professor, very helpfull and interesting. Don't listen those poor guys since he is really a good professor and knows very his topic. so if you really like DSP he can definitely help you. so enjoy | Mammone takes college sophomores and treats them like they are back in freshman year of highschool. We deserve more respect. | often made exceptions to EE theories that went unjustified through proof, only to be later clarified, and muddled, by sanutti | No Comments | this man hates students, hates life....looks down on kids, thinks theres no hope for someone to do well if they mess up 1 exam. | has a superiority complex. doesnt like people walking in late, and will waste time telling people not to walk in late. | More or less just goes over examples from text. He's similar to those audio tapes that accompany books so you can read along. | 1/3 of the class will fail, the average on the final last yr wuz a 40 -mammone | definite ass. lectures astoundingly ineffective.hates life and all people | he didnt want to be there in the worst way, routinely cut class short | Professor Dick Mammone lives up to his name | He's an ass. exams not too bad. Final impossible."
"Klein, Lisa","Decent lecturer, fair tests. HOWEVER, she may sometimes take off more points than you deem fair and arguing with her won't help. She definitely have favorites and is VERY condescending towards many others. Never have I ever had a professor than made me felt about 3 inch tall. Never want to take her classes ever again. Respect level for her is ZERO. | Good lecturer but extremely biased towards certain students. Picks favorites. Don't go to her office when she's in a bad mood. She takes off points on a HW assignment for incorrect sig figs. | Great teacher! very helpful. Lectures are very clear and she explains things very well. Prof. Klein follows the book very closely and gives great notes. She gives practice exams and always seems to have time to help. I wish all teachers were like Prof. Klein!!!"
"Garofalini, Stephen","Of all professors I've taken so far at Rutgers, Professor Tse is top 2 worst. He's arrogant, doesn't listen to students, doesn't teach. He went on random tangents all of the time and laughed when nobody knew how to do any of the quizzes. Incredible waste of time, taught the whole class to myself. I now have a horrible foundation in thermo... | You CANNOT finesse this course. You need to put in decent/honest work into every little assignment/question to be able to grasp the bigger concepts which are predicated on and presuppose your concrete and thorough understanding of minute details. Do the homework, go to office hours, listen very carefully to his hints, hold yourself accountable. | Lectures consist of him going on long tangents and making jokes. This would be cool, but we never learned anything in lecture. During the semester,he would throw temper tantrums about our low grades, blaming us. He changed the values of homeworks and quizzes consistently,making the syllabus mean nothing and causing more stress. Biweekly quizzes | I took it in 2019, there's been some changes. Tse covers a ton of ground and does about as well as I think is possible without cutting sections. That being said, the homework takes forever - 6+ hours a week. Make heavy use of office hours and the TA. Definitely the hardest class I've taken at RU but it's possible to succeed if you put the time in. | Worst Professor ever, someone need to talk some sense into this man | Stephen believes his lectures are helpful but are filled with his bad humor and conceptuals that dont help with problem solving. Class averages for midterms were around 40 and he proceeded to blame the class of about 100 rather than his own teaching abilities. You must read the book and teach yourself. Stephen is the definition of arrogant. | Lectures are good for theory and such but they don't really line up to what is expected on the homework and exams. Doesn't do any example problems in class either. Nothing special. | Thermodynamics with Stephen Tse was the best class I took at Rutgers. He moves quickly and covers almost the entire textbook, but he explains challenging concepts in a way that makes them understandable and even enjoyable. He pushes his students but gives open book exams and an extremely generous curve that rewards those who put in the work. | Professor Tse is an amazing professor, one of the best that I had at Rutgers. He lectures well, is highly knowledgeable and accessible outside of class, and wants to see students succeed. His tests are straightforward and open book; if you put the time into familiarizing yourself with the material, you will pass easily. Highly recommended. | Great professor, very helpful. | Thermodynamics, Awesome teacher! Open book tests with a formula sheet. HW is 20% Midterms are 25% and final is 30%. Curves are still huge though! He's a really good teacher who makes the material fun and understandable. Wish more engineering professors were like him. attendance is not mandatory though he will give pop quizzes rarely. | Very knowledgeable about everything. Heat transfer is a difficult subject but I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. | Really not the greatest teacher. Doesn't do any example problems and lecture is only deriving equations and such, with an occasional funny story. I learned everything from the book, which is helpful. | Really Smart and knows his stuff. his style of teaching is different. not so many examples but all concepts. he challenges you. overall pretty good | Best Teacher for thermo, wouldn't take it with anyone else! | Best professor ever...PERIOD! | Ok here u go engineers!! if you want to pass heat transfer ot Thermodynamics make sure u take Tse...he gives tons of partia credict.. open book exams.. plus one sheet of notes... he knows his material really well.. he is young and can relate to the average college student... he majes class fun...with dumb side notes... | The material of the course itself is hard, but Stephen tries to make it fun for the students. He's a teacher I wont fall asleep to, and he knows what he's talking about, which sometimes seems like it isn't the case with some profs. And he's cute, if you like azn guys. | I found the class very easy. He's very helpful and his exams are very fair. He gives lots of partial credit I actually got credit on a problem which i used the wrong formula. Definately take his class for heat transfer if you can I heard horror stories from othe professors who teach it. Its not the most intresting subject but he tries to make it"

"Goel, Ashutosh","Great Professor! Always went above and beyond to help students. The professor has no problem opening his door to students at all times, before exams especially. He embodies what a good professor should be, best asset in learning the material, yet a more than fair and gracious tester. I also loved the notes for this class, they shin next any others."
"Horvath, Robert","Matthews is a clear philosophy professor who does not like to simply pontificate. He encourages you to be clear about your claims when raising objections within class, and the standards for his papers, contrary to what other comments here, are not too high. The quality of a paper in a 400 level course will necessarily be higher. | Professor Matthews is an all around solid educator. He's very clear in what he expects from you, and he's very articulate when explaining the material. You're definitely going to have to work hard for an A but he's reasonable with his expectations. You have to show up to class though he had an attendance sheet that went around every class | Matthews is a great professor. For logic, he was clear and thorough. He is more than willing to explain difficult concepts more than once, is open to questions, and is very patient. For those who can't perform at a high level, they might feel ostracized by the standard that he teaches at. Go to class, pay attention, and meet him halfway. | The warning I would say about Matthews is that your arguments made in papers/exams must be FLAWLESS!! ONE WORD used in the wrong context can literally lower your grade. Making a cogent argument and demonstrating your understand of the concepts is not enough and in that sense I do find his standards too high for an undergraduate philosophy course. | The most pompous __ I ever met. Attendance mandatory in a philosophy lecture? A ridiculous amount of readings. Grading based on popularity and ass-kissing. Has no problem embarrassing students as if we didn't pay 20 grand a year to be insulted. | Matthews knows his stuff but holds students to an almost absurdly high standard. Expects you to understand/regurgitate every detail of every concept/argument in his own terms.Long readings that are incomprehensible w/o lecture. Takes attendance. Memorize class notes but use examples from the text to pass his exams. Also, do NOT get on his bad side. | Worst professor ever. I hate this class so much and its because the man doesn't teach anything. you have to do an oral presentation and that's what you use to study for the midterms and final... if you have a choice, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.... | horrible. he refused to allow class discussion in a seminar class and discouraged intelligent thought of any kind. | Matthews does play favorites, but its pretty much based on how hard you try... if you ask him for help he will help you, but he holds you to a really high standard that seems unfair sometimes, but you end up learning a lot... atleast in phi language | Took this in S06. The class was half-taught by student presentations, and he's a bad lecturer. Giving the presentation was fun tho. Essays were primarily explanatory. I did all the readings, skipped most lectures, and got an A. | Do not under any circumstances take any classes with matthews unless you really want to learn about philosophy of mind and animal thought. every class he teaches is the same. not worth the work, not interesting, and not nessisary for any requirements. DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES FROM THIS PROFESSOR. you will waste your time and money. | President of out country? i dont think you should be allowed to speak anymore....ever....he sucked and the reading was just too much | He is fair and makes an effort for students. I have to warn though, the material is difficult and he is harder than other graders. Will give C+/B for work that's usually inflated to B+/A. | Ok, maybe his handwriting sucks, but he repeats everything several times so you get everything. Subject matter might be a bit dry so he can be boring but when he gets to something he finds interesting, he makes it interesting. Also yet to see his mysterious temper. Bob is awesome, but you do have to go to all the classes unless you like reading Fod | this girl's a waste: ""I LOVE this professor! he is the cutest man, he reminds me of my ex- boyfriend. all people who say he's bad are complete morons. they're just jealous because he won't as much as glance in their direction because they're so ugly. i think he should be president of our country!"" | Material is hard and going to class is a must. He gives you all the notes you need and without them the articles are a bit obscure. He's a boring lecturer most of the time with glimpses of entertainent when he comes accross something exciting to him. Really smart guy, I wish I had gone to office hours to just shoot the bull. | very clear teacher, made classes interesting... only take if u plan to attend class though, otherwise u wont be ok | I LOVE this professor! he is the cutest man, he reminds me of my ex- boyfriend. all people who say he's bad are complete morons. they're just jealous because he won't as much as glance in their direction because they're so ugly. i think he should be president of our country! | He is by far one of the worst teachers i have had at rutgers. He does not know how to teach for****. He writes everything on the board so it seems like its easy...too bad you can't read a word of what he writes! Take his class and I guarentee you will know just how long 80 minutes really is. | Worst teacher I've had by far at Rutgers! Doesn't explain the subject material, is as confusing as the articles he assigns, and gives the worst tests ever! We had to take a second midterm because he messed up on the questions the first time. Do not take him...you will regret it! | Is a ****bag. Doesn't know how to teach. His handwriting is illegible and the tests are impossible. Going to office hours do NOT help. Be aware. | Don't mess with Bob. He knows what he is talking about. He has a good command of the subject mattter, is always prepared, and gives clear notes. Beware: has a temper that will come out when you least expect it. | WAY too heavy on pwr pt. Doesnt teach, just reads. have fun trying to stay awake. texts read like stereo intstructions. No class participation at all...what kind of philosophy course is that?!?!? Gets aggravated easily."
"Akdogan, Enver","Very condescending, makes you feel like you are never enough in an extremely rude manner. Expects us to know things we've never been introduced to and treats us with too high of expectations. Will go on 20min rants/freakouts, repeating the same thing over and over again. I would only recommend taking him to pass because his exams are take home. | So your entire grade is 3 Midterm exams (Celebration of Learnings) and homework is assigned but not graded. Honestly, a very different class than many engineering classes regarding to structure. Lectures are very abstract but interesting to say the least. Sometimes he comes off as egoist but grades in the Celebration of Learning is very fair. | Are we clear? | Hot take, did not like him. Spent so much time in class talking about random topics unrelated to the course that didnt help on exams. 3 exams all 1/3 of grade. Says ""attendance quizzes"" will affect grade, they never do (same with homeworks) even though they are ""mandatory."" Very inconsistent grading on the take-home exams (which take all wknd) | People keep saying this is mandatory attendance and homeworks, but they are wrong. They are ""mandatory"" but there is 0 repercussion or grade penalty for skipping/not doing homework. Little condescending in lecture but he has good intentions and if you put effort into the ""Celebration of Learning""s you will get an A. Just be thorough in answers. | He tells us to use the canvas ""chatroom"" to ask questions during the take home exam, yet rarely answers them. | He is IMPOSSIBLE to reach outside of class. Email him, he never responds. Good professor in class but if you need to communicate with him for any reason, even a take home exam, he will not respond at all. | He's a great lecturer, tests are take-home and pretty straightforward if you use the slides and textbook. He is very repetitive at times though and comes off as very condescending. ""Are you aware of this? You guys are engineers you should know this."" Be prepared to hear that a lot. Also random participation checks every now and then | He lectures in class and has open notes tests where all the answers can be found in his slides. highly recommend writing notes on the slides but don't be upset if you miss a class. he does pop quizzes for attendance which he uses to see if he should bump you up a grade if you're one below the next letter grade. Each exam is online and takes forever | He's an amazing professor who's very interested in student growth. He has 3 take home exams which make up your grade. His class is not that hard, just show up to class, and take some notes. Has sense of humor, and has a lot of catch phrases. Best engineering professor at Rutgers, take him. | Akdogan stands out from pretty much every professor I've ever had, for better and for worse. Grade is entirely based on 3 take home exams, which aren't too hard, but he'll still pester you to turn in your homework and attend class with threats of docking points. His passion is unmatched and he's pretty funny sometimes, so I didn't mind going. | Professor Akdogan is a really good professor. He cares more about the facts that you have learned something than just superficial test grades. He also gave us take-home exams and was happy to see that everyone did well. His only concern was if we were understanding the material and honestly we were because there was less pressure put on us. | I have seen god, and his name is Koray Akdogan. One of the best professors I've ever had. Was very practical, talked about industry applications a lot, dissected the material in a digestible way. His exams are reasonable, but you will need to make a good equation sheet for them. He is known to do take home exams, though my section didn't have one. | My favorite professor in the school of engineering by far. Extremely knowledgable about several fields, challenges students to think outside the box, and gives good advice for job searching/interviewing. Tests are very straight-forward and if you spend adequate time making your cheat sheet you should easily get a B+ or higher. | Pretty normal class. Go to lecture and pay attention even though his lectures are dry. Actually DO the homework because half of those questions are on the exam | Dr. Akdogan's a very intelligent professor who places genuine interest in the students' learning. Class moves fast, but exams are fair. Just 3 MTs and no final, and he provides study guides and lets you bring a cheat sheet. He always pushed us to think on a large scale, even though sometimes it felt like he was disappointed when we couldn't do so. | Had him for Mech Prop of Materials. Attendance sign in is required. Homework isn't graded. Test is fair with partial credit, so try to learn some of the material. He'll let you know what to study. His personality is quite arrogant, but he pushes his students to think outside the box. Would be a great lecturer if he didn't constantly belittle us. | I took his thermo class. Even if it was so hard, he was extremely helpful. He treats you as a future Engineer and he does not judge you if you ask any question. He is always there to help ! | Take this guy every chance you get. He's one of the best, if not the best, professors I have had at Rutgers. Make sure you go to every lecture because he does take attendance and will deduct points from your final grade if you miss more than 2 classes. | When I first took this class, I was scared because Dr. Akdogan really pushes people to learn the different parts of engineering. But for the exam, everyone is allowed a page of formula sheets. If you attend his review session, he will tell you what you need to know. Overall, he was a great prof who wants you to do well and if you get 50+ you pass. | This professor is the easiest professor I 've ever seen in the engineering department. No quiz, NO project, just exam. Nobody get grade below B and most of students get an A. He would post every thing in the sakai,which is so good. He deserve and get the professor of the year in the department. I so glad if I can take his other class | As stated under me, this professor is very intelligent. He really cares about every one of you and wants you to do well in the class. He makes you think in lecture so that you develop this mentality when you begin your professional career. Make sure to do the HW and show up to lecture and you should do fine in the class. | This guy is awesome, a very intelligent man. He actually wants you to do well and succeed and treats you like you're already an engineer. If you do the HW and stay on top of the class, you'll do fine. Put in a bit of extra effort, it's not hard to get an A. He clearly outlines everything about the class too. Would definitely take him again. | Awesome professor! had him for mech properties of materials. really nice! allows you to have cheat sheets and has generous curve despite the averages being in the 80s and even 90s. Assigns a lot of HW but his exams are like HW so if you do HW, you'll be fine for the 3 midterms (no final)!"
"Horvath, Robert","Condescending, rude, inattentive. | He was very engaging, highly recommend! | Go to class, ask questions, be engaged. He makes class really interesting and fun, and if you understand the big picture behind things, the class will be a breeze."
"Wenzel, John","cool class, but hard to understand anything when you cant see the professor. | He's great, but I had trouble seeing him at times. | He was just plain amazing | He is the champ"
"Birnie, Dunbar","Lectures informative and interesting but can sometimes jump around, he also plans cool stuff like guest speakers or virtual trips. Sometimes his instructions on hw aren't very clear but he is reachable outside of class and provides helpful feedback. Slow but fair grader. Tests are on excel and are related to the hw. | Dr. Birnie is a wonderful professor who really cares about students. He always tries to make the most of his lecture to share his knowledge and is always approachable... you can also have the opportunity to learn more about solar cells outside of the classroom during the semester... | Prof. Birnie is one of the best professors I've ever had. He really loves teaching this class. He can be a bit dry sometimes, but in general, if you put in the work, you will come out of this class with a functional understanding of solar cell science. | hard professor too hard for the elective class | He is a great mentor with broad knowledge on a variety of subjects. Very kind. You will learn alot from him."
"Tsakalakos, Thomas","The class was online even though it was an in person semester. Lecture was mandatory, and for every 2 lectures you missed you got 2.5% taken off of your final grade. He goes over 160 slides in 120 minutes, and all of them are math. He refuses to answer questions in lecture. The exams and homeworks were online, unproctored, and closed notes. | Has slides that look like they're from the nineties. Incomprehensibly mumbles through lectures. Learned nothing from class and relied heavily on the textbook . Website where homework and quizzes are taken (every single week) were managed horribly. Calls exams Celebrations of Learning to compensate for the fact that no learning actually takes place. | Literally my worst class in this semester. He tries to cover 2 chapters( each chapter 30-40 pages) in an 80 minute class. The class before the spring break got cancelled but we still have quizzes and homework for the chapters that he didnt cover. He doesnt answer his email like his TA. Very boring teaching style as he reads his PowerPoints. | What a great professor, it just does not get any better than this. Cares about the class, wants you to learn, he wants you to succeed. Very fair. I have enjoyed every minute of the class and learned a lot. Gives extra credit. Do the homework, go to class and you will do well. Actually both Tsakalakos and Akdogan are two of the best at Rutgers | He is clear and nice. The exam is not so hard, especially he dropped the lowest exam. Also he is funny as he called exam the celebration of learning. | Really great guy, funny, nice and awesome. Hard to understand sometimes, i found it was easier to learn by reading the book but thats just my learning style. the class covers a lot of material and can be tricky, but his testing style is amazing best tests I've taken in my 3 years here. | Very nice guy. Terrible lecturer. Very hard to understand him. That is not all. His powerpoint slides are very unorganized and he jumps around making it impossible to take notes. Do not go to class except on quiz days. You will waste your time. I stop going to class and studied the day before tests and I got A's. Take Akdogan if you have the chance | I love this man. He genuinely cares about his students learning and is so enthusiastic about teaching! We had a time issue with one of our exams because he hadn't printed out enough copies, and he's replacing the grade if we perform better on the other ones. Wouldn't want to take this class with anyone else! | Overall very easy class. His exams are not hard and hes very nice and enthusiastic about the subject. The material is very boring. Mandatory attendance and just 3 exams, no final. | Amazing Professor. An absolute Must take for Mechanical Properties of Materials. Goes the extra mile to make sure the students are learning as much as they can and that they take as much from the class as possible. Homework is 25% Attendance is Mandatory. 3 Midterms no final. Extra Credit Quizzes for 5% of the grade too. Easy Grader too!!! | Take the class with Professor Tsakalakos, and you will be glad you took my advice. Professor Tsakalakos is a terrific person. | One of the best teachers Rutgers - New Brunswick has to offer. His exams involve writing but it's not so much work. | He is a very enthusiastic professor and that is refreshing. But no enthusiasm could have kept me awake during such a boring class. He takes attendance and homework is 25% of your grade and it's usually very long. But I had no idea what I was doing for the first 2 exams. Still got 85s....SUCH an easy grader. Great guy! | Awesome professor, very nice, extremely helpful, excellent teaching and communication skills (he does speak with an accent but it is slight). I highly recommend him | Great professor who's friendly and approachable. He really has a passion for teaching which really inspired and motivated me to try my best. Thermo isn't easy but with a good amount of work and great attendance you should do well. | Great teacher, nice guy, always helpful | He makes stupid questions on the exams. Power Point Presentations not helpful on the exams. If you take this class forget about the rest of the classes. | Good teacher, loves the material he teaches, and enjoys relating it, it makes all the difference in the world, when that material is boring as hell."
"Haber, Richard","Never showed up to class, and still got an A. Just review the powerpoints before the exam and participate in the debate and you're set. You HAVE to do well on the debate, but its easy as hell. | Great guy. Old, wise man with a lot of knowledge. Course material WILL be dry and boring, but you can pull through it! The videos he shows in class are pretty interesting too-don't sleep through them- they are critical material. The wording of the exams might as well be law-schoolPHD level, but he allows for a GENEROUS curve. I'm a fan | I got a B+ in the class. He is the single most boring professor i've ever had.He has a midterm and a final which are impossible, but he gives a crazy curve and a group project is an easy A. In all, it shouldn't be hard to do well | good class if your interested in elections; never really have to go to class. test are hard but have curves, just memorize the practice test and you'll do fine. extremely easy ""project"". def a class you should take if you are a poli sci major or minor | Nice Guy...Easy to learn politics from a guy who looks like FDR..Show up to class..Take advantage of the study guides before exams..no excuse not to do well. | 2 Exams, 1-20page Group Paper, Exams are from Lecture notes and books, the tests were tricky so you should read all the material well beforehand... I got a B in the class, at times a dry and boring lecturer | I had him for Elections and Participation. I never went to class and just showed up for the midterm and final and still got an A. Gives a group project which are always annoying but adds a lot to your grade. Exams are hard as hell on purpose but he has a huge huge curve.Just read everything."
"Demauro, Edward","Terrible class, he went through content really fast and presented meaningless formulas without explaining their purpose. He skipped a ton of stuff in lecture, but it showed up on the hw and exam. The exams were open book and I pretty much learned how to do the exam problems by literally reading the book during the exam. He also never answers email. | This man literally never responds to emails. Also will often give a bad/ incomplete answer to the question. Will contradict himself multiple times when answering. On the other hand, he does teach in a very interesting manner. He is never monotonic (unlike 90% of the department). Overall great guy 4/10, one of the best of the department. :) | To do well in this class purchase a physical copy of the textbook. It's worth it, as his tests are all open book closed notes. Additionally, it is important to actually read the book because it clarifies concepts well. Do MANY practice problems. His lectures are conceptual and he rarely goes over any problem-solving strategies or examples. | Had him for Intro to Aerospace. You get 1 beefy homework a week that is usually difficult but good practice. Tests are open book and 1 or 2 cheat sheets, multiple-choice questions can be found in the book if you look. He makes his tests fair but they are not easy, and yes he does curve. Also, go to ALL lectures, there's a handful of pop-quizzes. | Great professor. Even though attendance not mandatory, I would not recommend skipping class. (Regular HW and Quizzes) | This guy is good, but the only thing is he writes all kind of equations from the book, but i really want to know how to them. of course you can apply them on homework. but i really wanted him to do some questions in class. But he curves a lot. just pray every does bad and you do better than class avg and you will end up with an A | The man, the myth the legend. Some say that the first compressed fluid formed when Prof Demauro spoke his first words, others say that fluids never even flowed until Prof Demauro showed them how, and many believe entropy exists because no fluid can move without paying tribute to Prof Demauro. Truth or tales? Take a class with Demauro to find out. | Demauro was very a good teacher and made the lecture material very interesting. However you really had to work for it if you wanted a good grade. | He follows the textbook very closely. But a really good professor, he brings real world examples and stories into the class. He explains every step he makes whenever he has to do math which helps everyone understand. Exams are about medium hardness, if you do the homework and you study at least a bit you should be good! | He was my intro to aerospace professor. He was precise and clear to understand. The exams are extremely difficult but they are open book. Deffinetely do the homeworks yourself and read the book before exam. Otherwise he is very intelligent in the aerodynamic field. He has office hours where he helps. Overall one of the good professors I took at RU"
"Weng, George","Completely impossible to understand. Exams were online 3 questions no partial credit. Easy group project at the end. I learned nothing. | i might've understood better if he taught me in chinese with my basic chinese skills :') seems like very nice dude though but you have to learn on your own, good luck and go slay | Mumbled for entire lectures, and wrote on a tiny whiteboard in the front of the class that I could not see from the middle of the lecture hall. His lectures are not worth attending. Grading for the statics class was very easy as long as you knew generally what was going on you could do all the assignments, and the final project was an easy A. | Not sure why so many negative ratings! The grading for this class was like the most fair and lenient that I've ever experienced. You could actually make a lot of mistakes in homework and still got 100 on it - the TA would actually left notes to tell you where went wrong but didn't take off any points unless you turned in a total hot goofy mess | He as a very thick accent, which on its own isn't huge issue. He also is kind of hard of hearing. It does seems like he knows the material very well but he cannot communicate it in English very well at all. I stopped showing up and just read the book, did HW and showed up for exams. | I could not understand the guy at all because of his accent. You can tell he is caring and does actually feel bad about his heavy accent but that doesn't really help students learn the material. Everyone pretty much stopped showing up except to turn in HW and do exams. Just read the book and learn from Jeff Hanson on Youtube if you have to take him | He can not speak proper English. He just mumbles and nobody can hear or understand sh t. His handwriting is horrible. Take attendance every class and after that everyone is just sitting there and not listing. He has a great passion for material and is happy to answer questions in class. But he just not a great professor. | If you get him just study by yourself and go to class only to submit hw and write quizzes and exams. | Not a great professor. Ended up needing to teach myself everything. He weighted the final incredibly heavy and did not give enough opportunities to gain points back on the final. Most people that deserved an A ended up not getting it. | Professor Weng will push you to succeed. His class is challenging and his emphasis on heavy note taking is annoying, but he is always eager to help and if you undertake the challenge you are guaranteed to learn a great deal from one of the brightest minds in world in the field. | Mechanics of Composites is definitely not a simple class, but he certainly wants to help you learn. Go to his office hours and he will help you through. His exam's can be tricky (I bombed the mid term) but if you study his class notes you will at least pass the course. Wish I did better, my fault, not his. | Good guy, he really wants to help you learn but its tough to understand him. He sometimes has pop quizzes to check attendance so be careful about that. The class is a little tough but he asks pretty straight forward questions. Mostly problems from the book. | Overall, he's a good professor. Most of the class is passing with good grades. Quizzes are not hard. At the beginning of the class he excused himself for not speaking good english because he just came back from Hong-Kong lol If it wasn't for his language, everyone would get an A. | lol yea he sucks dont try to go to him for help he sounds like hes yelling at you and the book they choose freakin sucks course is tuff as it is on top of that u get a guy who cant teach.. sit @ home and learn it yourself if u got this guy | His english is horrible and hes a an **** personally. Attendance is taken randomly. Exams are the homework in essence. Do the homework (make sure u understand what you are doing) and you'll be fine. ohh yeah, pray u dont have him for ur recitation. | This guy can't speak english for his life. Seriously. He may understand the subject, but can't teach it at all...his notes are messy, and his english isn't comprehensible. Make sure you're not in his recitation either, cause you'll be hopelessly lost. Book is useless as well, so find a recitation teacher you understand. | DUDE! He knows his stuff but if you want to take him, learn his language, lol.Advise: Sit up front, that will help a bit.He also goes very fast, as if he was in a rush. His notes are messy.Sometimes he remebers to take attendace.Don't have him for recitation you'll be screwed!Exams are a pain. | I must of thought I was in Asia or something becuase not word of english came out of his mouth the entire semester. OMG the worst professer ever. Had him for recitation forget it dont even try to understand him you learn more of his language then anythign of statics. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! | not a bad class but attendance is required and don't sign other people's names that don't go otherwise they fail the course. Also, he cant speak english. Take Pae!"
"Bagchi, Prosenjit","Show up to class and you'll be fine. Funny dude and tests are relatively easy if you study the lecture notes and do the example problems. Would definitely take another class of his again | I love professor Bagchi. He's very charismatic, loves what he teaches, and is a joy to be around. His exams are not too difficult, and he allows a cheat sheet to be made by you with whatever you want. there is one easy lab he had us do for only 10% of the grade which is fair given how little work it was. Hands down top 3 professors. | Professor Bagchi is excellent. I have had him for both fluids and aerodynamics and got an A in both. He clearly is enthusiastic about his work, and he tries to make it less boring sometimes. | He didn't record lectures and had surprise quizzes. Go to lecture, especially bc he gives solid lectures. The grading was done by the TA and was pretty strict last semester. Sometimes, the solutions are not complete or even correct. Takes a while to respond to emails. He doesn't want people to fail, but if you want an A you'll have to work for it. | He has very clear lecture notes and exam questions. Sometimes he doesnt provide full solutions to posted problems, but my main gripe was that he changed the entire course grading structure into having 4 quizzes and 4 midterms after he saw how people did on the first midterm. This came as a shock to many of us :( | Upon my first impressions, I thought he was rude and arrogant. But after looking back on the semester i realized he's a pretty solid professor. He's very interesting and keeps an energy that isn't boring during the lectures. We had quizzes instead of exams which was nice because it keeps you up on your work. | Dunno why he has such a good rating. Hes rude and uncaring for the most part. Refuses to respond to email and doesnt post anything online besides hw and mistake-filled hw solutions. not even grades. Hes not a bad lecturer, but if you have any trouble focusing, youre basically screwed. If u ask him to repeat, he gives you the ur dumb crazy eye | ME Comp was insane. Took this class fall of 2017 and it was one of the hardest courses I've taken due to poor structure and organization. There was no textbook to help and there was very little information online to assist. Grading was terrible until he realized the averages were too low and the final exam was out of this world. Learned a lot tho | Good lecturer, terrible prof. Directs all your email concerns to his TA, who he fails to keep in the loop, making your poor TA unable to help. Course structure is nonexistent, and his methods are erratic. Literally makes up the class as he goes (made final exam the night before). RU pulled course entirely after replacing him for its final semester. | Definitely take Bagchi if you can. He is exciting, interesting, and clear. He also cares a lot about his students. | GREAT PROFESSOR EVER... he just transforms a very difficult material to understand into the most easiest class ever. Three quizzes which are an easy A for anyone who has some common sense. DONT AVOID | Bagchi rocks! The homeworks are impossible, but the exams are super easy. There is a term paper, but it isn't as hard as it sounds. Easy A | Homeworks are impossible, but the exams are really easy (open notes), and there is a term paper. The book is expensive and useless--don't buy it! Bagchi is awesome; take any class you can with him! | He is an awesome professor... he can classified as GOD in the field of FLUID MECHANICS.. he is so explicit and clear with his concepts that he makes the class look so easy to understand. | easy exams, tough home works."
"Mazzeo, Aaron","439: Another classical awful engineering professor who does the bare minimum and expects everyone to just teach themselves, I cannot tell if mazzeo doesn't care or if he is really just this bad at teaching. Posts low effort videos that are tangential to assignments where if he makes a mistake(more often then not) the entire program doesn't work. | He's a nice guy but the structure of the class is very flawed. Although he did start teaching the topics in the later portion of the class it was too late. It is a very self-study class and I do not think that the lecture should be treated as an office hour like the way it was fall semester. I hope things change. Very hard class. | While the professor was quite nice, I often found his lectures to be not very helpful. I would say that he is a rather generous grader in terms of exams. He also did provide us with resources outside of lecture such as youtube videos and a groupme students could use for help. He also was generous grader for exams. | Mazzeo is a great dude but meh prof. Switched teaching style around a lil. Go to class, do every homework, watch his videos and youll be okay. I had 54 on first exam, 78 on second, 58 on the final and ended with a B for those wondering what scale looks like (i did every homework and lecture). Just write something on the exam and you'll get points. | to the future students, Brace yourselves. | Do not take his class unless necessary. Horrible teaching, unclear, and he only even started teaching mid sem. The playful demeanor doesn't compensate for his lack of defined structure in course. Self-learning is highly characteristic, making exam preparation challenging. This is me not even trying to complain. | I took this prof last sem and dropped the class cuz I hated how he taught. I took the class again and somehow he got worse. He talks(wouldn't call it teaching) for the first bit of class then stops and lets you work on what's basically your hw. Except to be able to do the problems, you need to teach yourself the material for the class. Good luck :( | he changed how he taught 3 separate times throughout the semester, and by the time the semester ended, the ""lectures"" were pre-recorded videos, and the scheduled lecture time became for asking questions. I did not like this format. Huge curve. | Professor is Mazzeo's lectures are just above used less and notes are barely any better. We are required to utilize youtube to try to teach ourselves the difficult material while paying the school between 15-25 thousand a semester. Tests are almost impossible and nothing like any of the other assignments. The exams are impossible to prep. for. | I liked this professor a lot. few comments: tests were not similar to homework, homework was hard, needed many youtube videos (Jeff Hanson, Efficient Engineer) and material was hard to grasp. He recorded lectures, also gave a zoom link for lecture. His office hours are very helpful as well. | lectures may or may not help you. his online content is helpful but many supplemental materials are needed to do well in this class (youtube, tests from other universities). Homework is not a good reflection of the test questions. HUGE curve. | Very nice prof. and seems very knowledgeable in the field. However, he falls short when it comes to lecturing. I tried to attend every lecture but at some point during the semester, HE started putting me to sleep in every lecture. The course itself is very interesting though and he even does live zoom and posts recording for the in-person class. | Hes a nice guy, I guess. Tests are NOTHING like homework and in class examples. Speaking of homework, its due every week. Even if you have a midterm he'll still assign you homework due on Friday. Honestly a pretty bad lecturer as well. Hove explained concepts better then this guy does. I would say to avoid him at all cost, but hes the only teacher. | Hes really nice and is personable, but when it comes down to academics, good luck. He let us have multiple cheat sheets and I hardly used them because of how hard the exams are. I didnt even study for them because of how hard I knew the next one would be. He posts hw answers so use those when doing the hw then review later. HUGE curve at the end. | He's a nice guy, but his teaching style is less than ideal. His exams are NOTHING like the home works, and he makes you grade it yourself. You will live and die with your partial credit. He basically just reads off slides, be prepared to read the textbook, which still doesn't help all that much. | Professor Mazzeo is an extremely nice and caring person, but the teaching is meh. For mechanics of materials we basically read off of lecture slides and are fed equation after equation; the exams are NOTHING like the homework (which there is plenty of). I did not enjoy this class at all. | The worst professor I have ever had. He gives a lot of homework which is a good thing, but the tests have nothing to do with the homework. All of his tests are curved because of how difficult they are, and how every one fails them. He made me really hate this class because I ended up with a bad grade and learned nothing. | He is a very nice dude but his teaching skills are terrible. His notes are useless when doing the homework because 90% of the formulas you use he dosent even tell you about. His practice exams are 100% different from his actual exams. The exam grades in my class were so bad he had to curve by like 30 points and people were still barley at a C | He is a very good person but the material is so bad. His teaching style is very boring and his exams are nothing like the homework or old exams. | Very nice guy, decent lecturer, he mostly works though example problems in class. The material is just so painfully dry that it would be hard for anyone to make this an interesting class. One 3 hour problem set a week and a small group project at the end, he gives you all the practice exams you need to get a good grade if you put in the effort. | His homework & class work are a waste of time because the exams are nothing like what you prepare for. I could not figure out a way for preparing for his exams and he will not give you any hints. If u ask him he'll say study everything we covered! But his problems are weired! He curves cuse he has no choice, otherwise 80% will fail. | Great professor. Ensures everyone understands the material in class, works through tons of examples. Always a help in Office Hours/After Class. Fair grader. Exams were not too hard, definitely manageable with good amount of studying and cheatsheet. | Clear lectures, answers ALL questions completely, provides all resources (HW solutions, lecture slides, past exams, etc) needed. Office hours are extremely helpful. Exams are very difficult but possible with the amount of resources he gives you. Gives one pretty simple group project. | he is a good professor but he doesn't get you ready for his exam. his exams when you take them are the hardest but then when he does the exam solutions in the board hits exams are so easy. his problems with his exam and his wording are really confusing. | From the other comments, he is definitely improving at teaching DMC with each semester. Lectures are a bit dry, but he does his best to spice them up. The exams are VERY difficult. They also have problems with multiple steps, so don't screw up the first part or you will lose MANY points. He curves generously to account for the poor performance. | I had his 3rd semester on DMC and I believe he has figured out the curve of teaching a bit more. exams are still lengthy and a bit difficult, but he teaches well enough that it is possible to do well on them. very nice person, also speaks clearly. | DMC. He's a nice guy but his exams are EXTREMELY hard. He makes up all the problems and they're nothing like book or homework or lecture problems. You can tell he is new to teaching and hopefully he'll be better next year. He has you do presentations which are pretty cool and help your grade. Homework and in class quizzes are important too. | New to teaching and it shows, seems like a good guy though. | He is very smart guy, but the problem is he don't know how to teach. But it was first time to teach people. You have to attend class because every lecture has quiz. Grade is kind of tough, but still his office hour will be helped."
"Gu, Xi","Took him for intro to CAD. Used a flipped classroom setting and the class consisted mostly of workshop problems. He was very helpful and wanted to make sure that his students succeeded. There were 3 midterms which were a bit difficult but he grades pretty leniently. There was also a final group project. | Prof Gu is one of the best MAE teachers at Rutgers. He is very interested in the subject matter and gets to know each of his students. The workload is challenging but he is a lenient grader and curves to compensate. Measurements is always said to be a very difficult and tedious class but Prof Gu made it a very enjoyable and manageable experience | Xi Gu is a very nice person but a very difficult professor. He reads off slides and expects you to learn. Gives difficult homeworks that require office hours and you can still get a low grade. Curves heavily since many do fail. | Xi Gu is the best professor I've had at Rutgers. He takes the time to learn his students' names and really cares about their success. He graded things very leniently and quickly- he had my exam graded the same day. I heard horrible things about the measurements class, but he actually made it very interesting. Xi Gu is the best!"
"Lin, Hao","Completely insincere, rude, and arrogant. His goal is to make students feel unintelligent. | Honors Dynamics w Lin was not very enjoyable, the class was lecture heavy and there was lots of hw. He's very intelligent and can teach you a lot, you just gotta get thru boring lectures and sometimes it's hard to ask questions because he'll make you feel stupid but he means well. He's a good guy, but the class was p tough bc he expects a lot of u | Mans talks more about counting beans than the actual subject. He yells at you for failing his impossible exams when the average is a fail. He expects a 10 - 15 hours per week time commitment when I have other classes and responsibilities and don't have the facilities for that big man. Every lecture I attend I lose brain cells, textbook is easier. | GOAT. One of the best in the department. He can lecture really well. That being said, don't mistake it for being a easy class. The class is hard, probably the hardest one you have taken up to this point. However, he makes it clear about the expectations he has for you. If you put in the work, actually do the work, you will do well. Def take him | Thermodynamics. Professor Lin has no real interest in presenting the material in an understandable method to the students and instead says that you should be learning from the book. Grades are based on a few things making it very difficult to recover from a few bad grades. Furthermore, he does not permit a formula sheet on quizzes or the final. | Hands down the best thermodynamics professor at Rutgers. Course grade is based 20% on homework, 7 quizzes (worst grade dropped) for approximately 40%, and the final is 40%. Quizzes are very straightforward and relate to HW. He is a very clear spoken professor that explains the content well. | Easiest professor and class I've taken in MAE. Grade based on HW, 5/6 quizzes, and final exam. Quizzes and final are heavily based off the HW. Just redo the HWs the quizzes are focused on the day before them and you're good. I'd advise going to lectures b/c he summarizes the main concepts you need from the textbook very well. | Not sure about the other classes he has taught but for thermo he was the best professor I've ever had, knew what he was talking about, spoke clear english, straightforward with what was on the quizzes/final, passionate about the subject. biweekly quizzes,hw, and the final made up the grade. Median grade for the class was a B+, a rarity in MAE. | Prof Lin's class and the course is very math heavy. Requires a lot of reading on the students part. Homeworks carry 30% of the grade and one midterm. Exams will be good if you listen in class and do the required reading. He does not grade on a curve. B is achievable, B+ requires hard work and A requires hard work and clarity of concepts. | I overslept a matlab final, so he put me in the next section. He taught me matlab very well, and I was able to learn without any previous experience. Cool professor. | Took computational dynamics of fluid transfer with him, worst decision of my masters and screwed my grade. He does not understand engineering or practical concept behind it but just maths thrown at you blindy. My reccomendation avoid him as much as you can. | Lectures consist of him reading lecture slides prepared by some other professor (with errors...) and asking students to work through the examples on the board. He gives a lot of online homework and tough but fair quizzes and exams. He is very strict with partial credit though so beware of showing him errors the grader made - you may lose points. | He's hard, but if you pay attention and ask when you are confused he's very helpful. The math was way over my head at some points but he explains it | Success in Hao Lin's class requires initiative on behalf of the student. His explanations are pretty bad. Refer to the book and peers. DO THE HOMEWORK!! His quizzes are exactly the homework. His tests are based on the same principles he teaches in class. Attempt the extra credit even if you dont know how to do it. Go to lecture and youll do well. | Very uncatering to the material covered in class. Had little background in matlab, he did not take this into account whatsoever. Help offered at times was downright nasty. Moreoever, the mathematics in this class is way over my head, even after completing calc 3 and am on my way to Diff Eq. *TA is outstanding, a very good resource- lifesaver"
"Gea, Hae","DMS is easy. Exams are exactly like problems assigned in homework. Lecture is only helpful if he is doing an example problem, otherwise, you won't need to know anything else he says. | He is cool. I will take his course again anytime. | He is not knowledgeable. He assigns HW despite admitting that students have solution manuals. DMC is really like taking physics for engineers and a BS course and DMS is completely useless. He also assigns group projects that allow you to learn how useless your classmates are and grades you on their incompetence. | Mandatory class for senior ME majors. Professor Gea teaches random topics in engineering design and requires ""mini-projects"" to be done throughout the semester. This class is unbearably boring for the most part and could (and should) be taught in a much more applicable and interesting way. The book helps for homework but that's about it. | He is very helpful and knowledgable on the subject. | he's really not good; English is kind of understandable but his handwriting is just not legible | i like this guy for some reason"
"Yi, Jingang","Hes the worst professor Ive had so far. Really fast talker, Homework is tough and Grades are harsh. Dont take this guy | His brain works at light speed. Fast dense lectures, and BRUSH UP on Mechatronics. Course content includes vibrations. 10 HWs (very time intensive, one dropped), 2 exams + final (25/25/35%). Control theory is genuinely difficult content, but if you accept that, you can appreciate Dr. Yi. Highly knowledgeable and accessible outside class. | He's the expert in robotics - no surprise he moves fast through the lectures. This semester he eased up over years prior. I only achieved a B thanks to grading: dropping a HW, extra credit on exams. Power points are make-or-break as they distinguish what's important. The course scope is huge but he's here to help. Reach out and he'll assist you. | So admittedly the course is very hard, despite this Professor Yi does his absolute best to communicate the material effectively, providing us with HWs and previous exams which were comparable to the exams he gave. Professor Yi also grades and curves quite generously. he does examples in class which are pretty important, go to office hours, it helps | Professor teaches so fast that I pretty much learned nothing from this class. Your entire grade is based on ten HW assignments, two midterm exams, and one final exam, all of which are extremely difficult and confusing. No wonder the minimum passing grade for the course was between 20-30%. | Tests are hard. The pace of lectures is VERY fast, therefore the lectures are confusing. Overall tough class and the professor doesn't help, however, he gives a bunch of examples in class which he goes over very fast so you don't learn anything | A lot of things wrong with this class...Grade only consists of HW & tests. HWs r graded harshly, tests don't align with hw&practice exams and he also puts weird definition problems there. Only way to get it right is to copy the lecture note to your cheat sheet. It's a waste of time, makes zero sense in terms of learning/understanding the material. | Extremely caring and nice professor, but the class was tough. He acknowledged that a lot of us had poor Dynamics and Mechatronics experiences and tried his best to fill us in. Does plenty of examples during lecture, but lectures can be a bit fast and confusing. Exams were very difficult but curves. | one of the worst proffesor at rutgers, may God have mercy on us. | Not a good professor. | The professor is not very clear with the teaching. Also expects a lot from the students. A good professor but hard to meet his requirements. | Really like this professor as he is very smart and knows many related stuff. He rocks! | Dr. Yi teaches and speaks very quickly, almost like he's talking to himself outloud. Seems to have no interest in helping or giving extra review sessions. His student expectations are way to high, he explains things as if you know the material already. | Very difficult to understand all around. He's a nice guy, but that doesn't help me learn anything. | dr yi seems like a smart guy but is totally incomprehensible. he expects way too much from you. take with dr moon if you can."
"Zou, Qingze","This was one of the most useless classes I've taken in the MAE curriculum... he cannot teach for his life and doesn't care to help students understand the material at all. | Total dawg. Miss him to death. Great dude. | He allowed us to do lab reports in groups. Exams and homeworks are difficult but doable if you attend classes and take notes. Grade was curved. | This professor is the type to care more about their own research for the school, then the students attending the school. Empty Lecture slides online, rendering them useless. Handwriting is terrible, barely legible. When asking a question, answers with,"" You should know this; not going to repeat myself; you learned this already"". -1000/10 | Worst professor for senior MechE lab. Not sure why this class is so poorly run. Saw him once over the course of a semester. The class is all run by indifferent and strict TA's. | Worst Professor ever, lectures arent even worth going to. The exams are total curve balls, you wont know anything in the exam. Even if you write out all the formulas on a sheet for the exam, the formulas wont help because theres thousands of formulas, where he never even mentions. He doesnt give practice exams to show you what might be on the exam. | Worst professor ever. | I have him for measurements right now and it's terrible! He's unclear and doesn't explain things :("
"Singer, Jonathan","Prof Singer is an ok guy (he can be pretty smug at times) but this class was just BRUTAL. It honestly took up so much of my time this semester. Class is split into two parts, sims in MATLAB and sims in ANSYS.Matlab part is hard because of the experience with matlab you should have, and the ANSYS part is hard bc its a hard software, ngl, avoid him | He loves to teach and chooses students to answer lecture questions throughout the class. The class is setup with hw, lab assignments, attendance, and a final project. The project is set up with checkpoints where he gives good feedback. The material is difficult with Matlab and Ansys doing different simulations. Gives past project docs as reference. | Singer likes to teach and you can really tell, he uses a flipped classroom style, which is helpful in more ways than it isn't. Final project is segmented into multiple checkpoints throughout the semester, and he gives good feedback all the way through. Content is fairly difficult (some heavy MATLAB) and the TA was meh, but he gives extra credit. | His assignments are challenging, but they definitely help you learn the material well. I left the class really feeling like I learned something applicable to my career. He is very helpful if you reach out to him and clearly cares about his students. | He is very enthusiastic and tries hard to help you succeed. Be prepared: his classes can be very challenging since he tries to teach through real research applications and sometimes overestimates his students' understanding of material, but he clarifies if you ask. The exams were a little harder than I felt necessary. Very helpful at office hours. | He was a very charismaticn person who was always willing to help students. Unfortunately, a lot of the test questions and the way the class was run in general were unclear. Tests were generally more about his ""xtensions"" to his research than the actual corse material. | His exams are WAY unecessarily hard. Expect to go above and beyond regular course material with his ""Xtensions""(anywhere from cockroaches to acoustic levitation), which are major exam sections. I understood all course material, but Xtensions were confusing. However, he is very helpful during office hours and is eager to improve his teaching style. | He gives exams that are very difficult compared to the type of questions covered in class and on the homework. The curve on the class at the end is pretty good, but it was still a miserable experience. | JP Savage is truly unique. A god among statics lecturers, he will teach you friction despite being told not to by an experienced lecturer; he will he skip example problems because they're ""too hard""; he will promise to upload annotated lecture slides, then upload powerpoints with dozens of slides of example problems with nary a single explanation."
"Burlion, Laurent","Professor Vera is very knowledgeable, patient, and organized. As a student who previously unfavorably viewed math classes, his amazing teaching style made me excited and interested again in the subject. I'd really recommend his class; he's great! (Also, his TA is wonderful too.) | Really good teacher! The course module is clear. TA is great too! The notes outline will be sent in advance and the professor's own complete notes will be available for preview and review. There will also be video lessons and mock questions before the exam, which will be more difficult than the exam | Easiest class I took in my first semester here at Rutgers because of this man. His notes are flawless and straight forward, all his review sheets help you prepare yourself for the exams and I am so happy I had the chance to experience having him as a professor. Def recommend him for anyone taking this class! 1000/10 Professor! | Vera is easily one of the most helpful professors I've ever had. Extremely kind and intelligent and always willing to give feedback and help with any mistakes you might make on a quiz or exam. Definitely take calc 2 with him. | Great Professor! While the tests were really strictly graded, he was just following the rubric. He helps you understand what you did wrong and is accessible after class! He responds to emails fairly quickly and hand-writing is clear during lectures! Underrated professor, might be the best out here. | Good Professor. Pre-class lecture videos, lecture notes, workshop, and quiz results all posted online to review material. Review sessions before exams. Home works are time consuming. Overall, good class. | Genuinely helps his students study for exams, gives more than enough resources to prepare for tests, also gives lengthy review sessions. | I had him for Calc 2, and he is easily the greatest math Professor I've had in my life. He is extremely knowledgeable and shows multiple ways to approach problems when possible. He is also patient and thorough with both his explanations and his feedback. | Polite, patient, knowledgeable, and lowkey cute. The best professor I've ever had. TAKE HIM. | Had for Precalc 111 (pt.1) - amazing professor. He built a solid foundation for me to work upon by correcting common mistakes and by breaking down difficult problems into easy to understand parts. Very thorough in the lectures. Tests and quizzes were very fair. Neat handwriting and speaks clearly. | Professor Vera is the best possible professor for Calculus II at Rutgers. He is incredibly helpful and provides more than enough resources to succeed in this course. Great professor! | Professor Vera explains every topic clearly and really well. The class is incredibly difficult and you will struggle, especially on the homework assignments which are irrelevant to the exam material. | Prof Vera is a relatively easy professor and is very nice. He does a flipped classroom and helps us with all of our assignments before we submit them so that it is an easy 100%. As long as you go to class and watch the videos you will do good. | These class was great, it was a flipped classroom. Which you watch lecture at home and then do work in class,Prof.Vera just does little review and then helps you with the assignment. But overall, was a great class, Vera is very helpful and explains everything clearly. Absolutely recommend!!! Small quizzes every class and 2 midterms and a final! | The best math teacher I've had, he has very clear notes and took the care to rewrite all of his notes to make them easier to write down and learn in lectures. Homework and recitation assignments were lengthy, but if you go to his lectures and actively absorb the information you should have no problems. absolute goat | Top math professor you can get. Highly organized, shares notes online, provides optional extra practice for skill improvement, offers pre-lecture videos introducing topics, and has detailed notes outlines for better focus in class, super fair exams as well. Truly the best professor I've experienced in college. Took him for calculus 2, got a A. | The best professor forever. His lecture is amazing and organized. | Fantastic professor. He posts all his notes online and his exams are very fair and he is always available to answer emails or offer help. Calc 2 has a really bad reputation especially at rutgers but Prof Vera makes the topics very easy to understand and overall is one of the best math professors | As a freshman, Professor Vera was an incredible teacher. His lectures were well organized, he was very neat and had a great balance between notes and examples. He is very kind when people ask questions, and makes sure everyone understands before moving on. I would highly recommend taking him if you are hesitant about calculus. | One of the best professors I've had. Calc was a really hard course and I was hesitant if I would pass the class, but Professor Vera gives great lectures, so I recommend you go. He is very helpful when you come to his office hours to ask any questions. I would take his class again if I could. | Amazing professor! He uploads great notes and has very clear lectures. He is seriously one of the best calc professors out there. | Makes calc so easy to understand and truly cares about his students. take him if you want a good professor. by far one of my favorite college professors | Exceptional lecturer. Professor Vera took his time with every lecture to assure everyone understood the concepts. No matter how easy or ridiculous the question would seem, Professor Vera would still take his time to explain it. Calc isn't an easy course but if you pay attention to lectures and do sufficient practice you'll be perfectly fine. | Vera really is an amazing professor. He always makes sure you understand the material before he moves on to the next topic. He does have a little accent, but that didn't bother me at all because I understood everything he said. The only downside is, each week he gives us hw that would take me FORVER because the hw would have things we didn't learn. | This man is a godsend. I failed this class once already and took him this time and did amazing. Very accessible and kind. Holds review sessions out of genuine care for his students. Explains questions from all different angles and clarifies down to the detail. The combo of Dr. G's resources and Prof Vera's lectures will be your key to success. | Calc at this school as a whole is made for you to fail so you're going to struggle with any professor. Im terrible at math and this class was very difficult but I genuinely do not think I would have passed if Laurent Vera was not my professor. He holds review sessions before exams and is quick to answer emails and wants you to be successful. | It was a hard class but that's just because calc is a hard class. the way he taught it made it much easier and better explained than anyone could. he taught it well and simply, he is easy to talk to and will assist you if need be on an issue | Taking Professor Vera's class will definitely prepare you for the exams. He is very helpful in helping you to understand the material as he will clarify any questions that you have during lectures and in office hours. | He is a great lecturer. He explains things in a very straightforward and concise way and always asks us if we have any questions about anything. Great professor, highly recommend. | calc 135 is standardized (hw and quizzes vary between professors), so it doesn't really matter what prof you have but if you have the chance TAKE HIM. Never took calc in high school but still managed an A, with high passes for each midterm! Professors like this guy make college worth it | I love Vera. Take this man. I took calculus in highschool so I know calc, but I would still love this teacher regardless because he is super approachable and friendly, yet informative and effective at lecturing. He is my favorite professor so far. The material can be difficult at times so practice the previous exams. TAKE HIM! | He is a very chill professor, he will make sure that you understand the material if you reach out to him. Sometimes his lectures are hard to understand if you dont know calculus so make sure you have some friends in class. This class is miserable but not because of him, he is very patient and will explain a topic as many times as necessary. | Vera is one of the best lecturers I've had. I don't think there's ever been a question that he couldn't answer and explain perfectly in class. He definitely knows what he's doing, and he can teach it well. Obviously the class is hard and requires a lot of heavy lifting, but it doesn't hurt to have him as a prof. He's also p chill in general. | Laurent is a great prof. Only being a month into the course, he really does show that he cares. He holds review sessions for midterms and really goes in depth during lecture and always asks us if we have any questions before moving on to the next concept. Great guy. Show up to lecture to do well on exams, he really wants to help his students | Prof. Vera's lectures are absolutely amazing. He will clarify as many times as needed until you understand. Try to answer his questions to the class; you'll learn a lot from asking about what you don't understand. | Amazing professor! The lectures were so clear and well put together. All questions were answered thoroughly via email, during office hours, or during class. The homework was not bad at all because all the concepts had already been covered during class. The grading criteria was clear and I would definitely recommend taking this class with him! | Vera was a great professor. He taught the concepts of linear algebra very well. His lectures were organized and his notes were useful. However, the homeworks, at times, got very tough and the quizzes, at times, were difficult as well. But he is very helpful both in lecture and during office hours. He is also easy to reach out to via Email. | Great Professor. Unlike other professors, Vera taught very well and explained each topic. Even if you didn't attend the lectures, his notes online were super clear. Tests and quizzes weren't hard or easy, just in between. Highly recommend attending his office hours so you can ask any questions and better understand the topics. | Tough grader for exams. Failed every single one of them. But lectures are very organized. I think I'm just bad at Calc 152. Have to retake over the summer. | Professor Vera does a great job ,he explained all the steps, really care all the students can follow the class. And he gave us the lectures notes for all the topics, I never saw a math note so organized like his. I am not good at math, finally I pass calc2. | Perfect all-around professor. Amazing lectures, always loved attending them. He posts his lecture notes that are very neat and precise, you can study from them for your exams. Pre/post quizzes, homework, and workshops are very good for preparing you for the exams. Personally, I enjoyed them. Wish I could write more on how good of a professor he is. | I took Professor Vera's math151 in the fall and 152 in spring. After a whole year of calc with him, I can say that Vera is the best-organized professor I have ever had in my life The lectures were delivered in such an efficient, concise, compendious manner it is actually unbelievable. Vera is the goat. In all seriousnessDef my fav professor now | Vera made Calc 2, a class that is quite difficult because of its loosely related, complex concepts, all the more easier. He genuinely cares and will do his best to answer your questions, and his best is THE best. He has a deep understanding of math and can even prove concepts to make them easier to grasp. The exams are challenging but doable. | Professor Vera is one of the most thorough and organized professors I've had the pleasure of learning from. It felt like he was always prepared to answer any kind of question, long as it pertains to calculus. His tests are a little bit harder than what I've seen from other Calc professors, but at the same time, Professor Vera prepares you for them. | Vera really knows what he's doing. I felt confident being taught by someone with so much expertise. Calc at Rutgers is tough, but the professor doesn't create the exams. You should do your homework and recitation quizzes, as those combined are a big chunk of the grade. Vera is the best to take!! | Vera was a great professor, the only reason I am rating it this difficult, because any math class at Rutgers is very hard if you do not know it well. If you struggle in math calc 135 will be hard. He is probably the best calc professor, very clear on everything. He actually cares and will help if you ask. | Great professor! He's very knowledgeable and intelligent. If you are like me and not adept at math, this class will be difficult with little/no prior knowledge of calculus. You would have to put extra effort into learning the material throughout the semester in order to succeed. However, his lectures are very clear which makes the class tolerable. | Professor Vera is really nice however the exams can be tough sometimes. Do all the homework in order to receive credit as well. Concepts are taught vaguely. However, if he sees that you are hardworking he will make sure you pass the class. Calculus is a hard concept to grasp on so go to extra help. | It was hard to progress in his class because he only taught us limited basic concepts that have never appeared in our exams. On top of that, we got an overload of assignments that certainly did not came with sufficient time to be completed. The ones who progressed in his class certainly came with an abundance of knowledge obtained from high school. | Prof Vera definitely knows his stuff and is a great calc teacher. He's very clear and always thoroughly explains lectures. Out of the other calc teachers at Rutgers, he's definitely one of the best."
"Baruh, Haim","Absolutely love Prof. Haim, really nice and really cares about students. | Professor Baruh is one of my favorites in MAE. This was his first time teaching aircraft flight dynamics and even so, he knows the subject very well. This class is hard, but he will make every effort to help you succeed if you want to. | Had this guy twice. Both times I thought he was awful. Gives matlab projects that are tedious and time consuming for a homework grade. no other prof does this. | Great professor. Clear, funny and just the nicest teacher. I recommend that you take him if you have the opportunity. I went for help multiple times each week and he was very supportive. The negative feedback that I just read does not match the conversations I have had about Prof. Baruh with other students. | Good professor, but just watch out for the mistakes in class lectures and solutions. Easy to talk to, and tries to be funny. (TRIES). I'd recommend taking him. Compared to other professors I've had, he's among the top. | Good professor, inserts a joke in class everyonce and a while to keep you awake, gives copies of old tests to practice from | He is a poor teacher. His lectures are boring and he mumbles a lot. He also expects you to know a lot of the material before he teaches. I had him for dynamics and had to drop and take it again with another teacher. | Great teacher! Smart,clear and concise | This man is one of the smarter professors that I ve ever come across. He can teach any class in the school of engineering of the top of his head. The reason he gives a comp project is to teach you a very important skill that you WILL need when u graduate. He tries to challenge people on his tests so you ll learn a lot. He does ramble a lot! | I had him for dynamics and he was BAD!! so dont take him!! this past summer he taught vibrations & controls and i was amazed that he was actually a very good professor for this material.His notes were good and his tests were fair and when it came to grades he was very lenient.Just make sure you do his practice exams and you'll do fine in the class. | Yeah, he is pretty bad. Spends the whole period on one problem cause he gets lost. Difficult exams and terrible text book. Two computer projects that suck. But must have a nice curve cause i failed the first exam and managed to get an A. | cant teach | Writes too small, talks too softly, takes phone calls through class. Doesn't actually teach the material needed effectively. DON'T READ THE PAPER! | Class is crazy hard and teacher just rambles through class. | class is very much on your own. If you don't get it your screwed. No resitation, horrible book, and he mummbles through lecture. Office hours don't help unless you already know what you're doing | seems confused most of the time. | Incredible teacher, great textbook, nice guy"
"Benaroya, Haym","Prof. Benaroya was a fine professor for DMC. He has a clear passion for the topic and never wasted a breath during lecture. Great with answering questions. The class was 3 exams, open book, and homework. Exam questions were a mix of in-class and HW problems, very reasonable if you put the time in. Good class and would recommend! | Professor Benaroya is a very good professor and he never wasted time in his lectures; whatever we went over in class was exactly what was covered on exams. He is a very considerate grader and very helpful outside of class. He is very soft spoken which made it hard to hear sometimes but he is a very good lecturer. Would highly recommend! | I LIKE TO TAKE CLASSES WITH THIS PROF. REALLY HE IS VERY GOOD IN TEACHING AND INTELLIGENT . ALSO , HE IS GENTLEMAN. HE MAKES HIS CLASS EASIER AND INTERESTED. ALL TIME U CAN SEE THAT SMILE ON HIS FACE. I'M LUCKY TO TAKE CLASS WITH PROF. BENAROYA | Great professor. Hard class. Three exams. One 10-page paper. One of the best professors in the department. Pay attention in class, do the hw yourself (don't copy straight from solutions, he'll give you a 0). First exam is easy, the second two are hard. Make sure you study well - not just the hw, but lecture examples as well. | The best professor at Rutgers school of Eng, hands down! There are only a few people in this world that are extremely knowledgeable but at the same time not arrogant at all. He's one of those! He made sure he was well prepared for his class everyday, treated his students nicely and taught us well. Take him whenever you get the chance! | Dr. Benaroya is a great teacher, the subject matter was pretty hard, but he did a great job. Doesn't care if you come to class or not, homework is not mandatory, grades pretty fair. | Class with very hard material that piles up quickly, but you really can't ask for a more helpful professor, who wants you to do well and makes himself very available. | Good teacher, class is boring at times but one of the few teachers that WANTS you to learn. Attendance doesn't count, but missing classes definitely will hurt you as material piles up quickly. Good personality, especially for an Eng prof | Probably the easiest professor for vibrations, although you do still have to do some work. I enjoyed him a lot. He uses his own textbook; everyone else uses Bottega's book which I heard is terrible!! | Great Teacher, Easy to work with, Knows his stuff."
"Muller, Michael","Professor Muller is very passionate about power plants, even during late night classes, which makes the class easy to attend. He has a very positive vibe and is willing to answer any question students have. He is very knowledgable on the topics, therefore he is able to explain each topic with clarity and detail. You can tell he truly cares. | Most entertaining professor you will ever have for meche. Hes very passionate about powerplants and is very knowledgeable but the class lacks structure. He doesnt have a set grade breakdown so u never know what ur grade is. Final was ridiculously hard. Quizzes r not bad, class is very thermo heavy. Online sources used so no need for steam tables | Took him for both Power Plants and ICE. His lectures are always entertaining & interesting. Provides slides based on years of experience in the field so no textbook. Quizzes usually every week and optional student presentations. Talk to him after class for brownie points, he is happy to help. Got an avg of 5/10 on the quizzes but still got an A. | Great professor. If you have any interest at all in power plants, take his class. You learn about main components of a power plant and the thermodynamics behind them. If you struggled with cycles in Thermo you'll struggle in this class. Interesting class because it's not the generic rigorous math/theorems, you'll learn about machinery, etc. | Best Proff at Rutgers hands down. Students learn relative information used in industry. Very smart guy | Class is very thermo related, but grading is really generous. awesome guy, doesn't teach enough thermo tho | Awesome professor! Knows how to teach and makes the materials interesting and funny. Plus he's a great guy who tries to help all his students. Absolutely 100% recommended. | He's a great teacher. I had him last year and he was a really great guy. Def take him if you get the chance!! He really tries to always be open for communication with his students and you can tell he loves what he teaches! | One of the best professors Rutgers has to offer, and that's why he's only teaching one class...because rutgers doesn't like to see students happy. He's absolutely hilarious and helpful, he doesn't fail anyone, his quizzes are very generously graded, his final is hard as ****, but this will be the most fun you'll have in any MAE class at Rutgers. | He seemed funny at first, but then stopped showing up to lecture. He had his T.A. teach the course and came back at the end of the semester just in time to tear our presentations to pieces. He's useless as a professor and T.A. gave hard quizes. Final was easy though."
"Mookerjee, Purusottam","Lectures would run slow and got monotonous at times. DSC isnt an easy class but he only tested on essentials & it was clear what to expect on assignments. Straight forward class, make sure to pick a good partner for hw & project. Start early on projects. He is helpful in office hours. Can be condescending but overall, he is a solid professor! | Good teacher doesn't see them selfs as speakers with a passive audience they need to impress, nor they view their interest is important. Instead, professor Purusottam Mookerjee really sees him as a guide and helping others to learn. and that's why: we should protect him at all cost | I thoroughly enjoyed taking Orbital Mechanics and Control Theory with my main man Mooks. I would say his style of teaching is pretty straightforward, as his exams closely follow the homeworks and the material presented in class. Easy? I'd say no, but think about it: An easy class doesn't have you learn very much. What use is that? | Tries to make sure everyone understands his lectures, but sometimes tends to digress. His exams are like the homework problems. Assigns two projects, but he goes over them in class and is quite helpful. | So long as you do your hw, you'll do well. | decent teacher, but you need to be good with matlab to do well"
"Bilgen, Onur","Avoid at all costs. Possibly the worst professor in the department | Expect an awful time. Sits at a table and just goes through slides from the textbook. Asks you to stay 10-20 minutes after the end of class so he can finish his lecture. Asks vague questions, can barely answer student questions without giving conflicting answers or non-answers. Exams were ill explained and with no guidance on grading expectations. | The professor is very unorganized and constantly contradicts himself. The exams were nothing like what we said they would be. His motto is understanding the concepts, however all exams were how lucky or good you got at putting the correct formulas on the sheet. Avoid at all costs. It's not worth the headache of dealing with him. | When it comes to exams, this professor seems to be more concerned about you knowing what the concepts are, rather than you being able to apply them in actual problems. We were expected to do nothing more than copy down the equations discussed in class, so unless you had a really good formula sheet, you're screwed! | Lectures are boring and impossible to follow. The content of the exams was completely arbitrary and the class was misled every time. They did not test understand of material or problem solving, just if you were lucky and happened to copy the correct formulas on your equation sheet. Overall this course is a complete waste of time. | Amazing lecture, gives good feedback, inspirational, hilarious, caring are all things you wouldn't use to describe him. | His lectures are dull but full of information. He gave open-notes quizzes randomly to see if you paid attention. His test is doable and the problem was similar to the example seen in the PowerPoint. Try to do your best and if you do not understand something go to him, he will try his best to explain."
"Guo, Zhixiong","the worst prof AVOID HIM. He doesn't care about his students and he even makes mistakes and doesn't admit it. for one of his quizzes LITERLLAY SAID next time just write your answer on the paper if you dont find it in the choices?? TA's uses different equations in the lab and if you use the equation you were taught in the lab prof gives you a 0 | He is a terrible professor. Even with his few in-class extra credit questions, you won't understand what he's saying anyway. His quizzes are graded so unnecessarily heavily (e.g., T or F 40/50 points) that studying for all eight to replace midterms just screws you over regardless. Plus a bunch of toughly graded bi-weekly individual lab reports. | I hated his in Thermo and I have him now for measurements and I hate him even more. Avoid at all cost! | Weekly quizzes, labs that he changes the rules for on a whim, pop quizzes(actually attendance) and weekly homework assignments make this class awful. The only way it could be worse is with Professor Guo teaching it. His lectures are worthless(even if you understand what hes saying) and he does not care about any of his students. Avoid at all costs. | does not care where the greater distribution of students are when deciding on grade cutoffs. 9/141 students got what he defined as an A. A final thats worth 40 percent of your grade with over half of it not considered for partial credit causes scores to be very low, like average below 50. still has minimal curving in class. Please dont take prof. | possibly the worst professor i've ever had. weekly quizzes, and a final worth 40% of your grade. the lectures are useless. | Avoid hime | Doesn't care about students. No partial credit in tests, doesn't accept late assignments whatsoever, doesn't post answers to quizzes online so quizzes are useless to review for final. quizzes are exactly like homework tho, and no midterms just a final exam and that's the only good thing about this class. Choose another professor if you can. | this class sucked | Nice guy. Lectures were a little hard to follow but I think it was bc of the material. The quizzes and exams seem random so refer to the textbook and lectures. HW and labs are worth a good chunk. | Tooke graduate heat transfer. A little bit difficult to understand because of his accent. Open book and notes exams. 10% grade for attendance. Credit in exams given based on approach and engineering understanding over the solving part. Very easy grader and genuinely cares about his students. B+ is very easy and A is possible with hard work. | hei s by far the worst professor i have ever taken, the worst the worst the worst the worst, I had average to bad professors. he is on a whole league of his own. he makes karate sounds while he is teaching, he thinks he is speaking english but his high pitch voice should be used in an anime show. he made one of the easiest classes the hardest. | Attendance is optional, No exams but tricky quizzes. Hard to understand what he says, he has a heavy accent. he does not give enough time to prepare for his quizzes. Don't try to ask him questions because his answer will be, Check your lecture notes or make you look stupid by the way he answers | Attendance not mandatory, he is a very easy professor and a light grader. No midterms, just 3 quizzes and a final. BE CAREFUL THOUGH: The Final was extremely hard unlike the quizzes which were very simple. A lot of people slept on it. His English isn't great either. | Great professor. No examns, only quizzes. Final is open book, open power point slides, open notes. My mistake was messing up the first four quizzes. GREAT PROFESSOR. don't avoid | great guy, gives you A LOT of chances to earn points. I should have studied so hard right from the beginning. | Professor Guo really tries to help students do well in his class, the problem is however, is that his English is very unsatisfactory, making it sometimes very difficult to understand or pay attention to him. He has weekly homework assignments, a few quizzes, two midterms (best is kept) and a final. Not too difficult to get at least a ""B"" in. | Zhixiong is ok, but not great. He gives two midterms, but only the better score counts. Better still, he even has a 'stimulus' policy based only on a multiple-choice final that was harder than expected, but class is still an easy B and an A is quite possible. Nice guy who's willing to help, but he can't speak English!! | Speak very poor english. Most of your studying is done from the book and if you choose to, notes he posts on the internet. The semester ended with about 10 people out of the original 200 attending class. It's awful. The only good thing is that he tries his best to make sure no one fails...the curve was ridiculous and it changed 3 times. | i've had better"
"Guo, Yuebin","This professor seemed to show little care for the class as a whole. Exams were not hard, but the material was difficult to learn as lecture was not very helpful. The homework and readings were the most helpful. The final project was not hard, but no grading criteria or rubric was provided for it. | This professor is one of the best I've ever had. His lectures are clear and concise, the homework is short and easy to understand, and he doesn't outsource his exams to McGraw Hill! Because of him being so great at definitely writing his own exams, he always knows what is on them and what tables are required. 10/10 would recommend! | For Design of Mechanical Components. Homework's the most tedious ever and it's hardly useful at all for learning. Exams have many problems. Uncaring and unreceptive to students, always blaming issues on the department or the homework website. A fire alarm could be going off, and I doubt he'd know what to do. If he's the only prof available, glhf | Clueless about tech and entirely relies on McGraw Hill. Lectures are McGraw Hill slides but are presented unorganized and with poor handwriting all over the slides. Very difficult to communicate with; during an exam, he couldn't understand the issue after 5 minutes of me screen sharing and showing a question's table was incorrectly formatted. 👎 | If this professor is teaching your class, self study or reconsider taking. Professor Guo gave an exam with instructions citing specific ways the exam would work. When the exam was opened, all of this was changed. Also runs a Hybrid class reading directly off of pre-generated slides. Exam was not properly timed for given time frame. | Bad professor, his teaching and methods are completely different. He covers so many different topics using handouts from random book chapters that makes learning and mastering everything impossible. The course is an intro to advanced manufacturing but his class is anything but an intro. Highly recommend the other class in industrial engineering."
"Jaluria, Yogesh","Professor Jaluria was a great professor, the class itself is meant to be hard though if you get the book majority of the time quizzes/midterm/final questions are just an example from the book rewritten. Do the homework, it helps a ton, few actual formulas in this class, it is more concept heavy and applying those concepts to the formulas. | Had him for thermodynamics, he's a great professor, very passionate about the topic and ready to answer questions. All quizzes and exams were open notes/open book so highly recommend buying a physical copy of the textbook to make your life easier. Also, definitely go to lecture. The lectures can be slow or boring at times, but they do help. | Thermodynamics is a difficult subject but professor had very concise lectures and outlined to us what would be on quizzes and exams. He is a very flexible professor to go to office hours or even talk to outside of class. Very excellent professor. | Crazy that someone with their own Wikipedia page is teaching undergrad thermo lol. His lectures never really clicked with me, but he is much better during office hours. Genuinely wants his students to learn, regardless of what their letter grade. 7 quizzes (2 dropped), 1 midterm, and 1 final all open book/notes. Optional (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) hw. | One of the best in the department. Heat transfers not easy but he makes it make sense. Extremely helpful. Go to lectures, it will really help u understand the content and do well. Most students struggled since 70% of the class wouldnt go to lectures. ASK QUESTIONS. He is an expert in heat transfer and genuinely cares for students learning. | He goes really quickly in lecture, but it's way easier to follow if you have the textbook with you. Has many good insights but you have to be paying attention b/c of how quickly he goes through material. Great to go to for career advice. He's famous in his field so definitely try to get him as a prof and go to his office hours. | Great class, I've learned so much about heat transfer. Really tries to make sure people succeed! I wouldn't take this class with anyone else | I love this class. hes just so smart | great guy, cares about teaching and seems to know EVERYTHING about heat transfer | Get the book, it makes a big difference. Attendance counts. 5 of 7 Quizzes count. Quizzes are based on the recitation Labs. Can use all your notes (Sakai too). Project can be solved by going to the bookgoogling, it will take a week to do. The TA is of help as well. Final Exam is like the Quizzes but a bit harder. 5 Questions, covering all topics. | Amazing professor. We used his book, which was really helpful and it's necessary to pass the class. The lectures are interesting. He tries to help but can be confusing at times. | I took him for matlab and he was so cool and really easy, but now he's hard as hell. The course itself is useless as well. Still seems willing to help though, but the lecture is a waste of time. | Great | cant really understand 1 thing he says..but hes a nice guy and tries to help...keyword is 'tries', cuz he usually just ends up confusin you more | Not good, either. | not bad"
"Knight, Doyle","Very nice gentlemen! I took his Byrne Seminar last fall which was about high speed trains. 2 easy assignments, just do what it say and your set. | He just reads of slides weekly quizzes around 12, lowest 5 dropped. Considers a unit error conversion as a disaster since we're engineers. Assigns hw that isn't graded. He doesn't allow makeup for the quizzes unless military service. I had a car accident and he didn't let me retake the quiz. Final was a bit of a curveball, with only three questions | Basically reads slides for lecture, weekly quizzes, open notes, open book(hardcopy only) doesn't grade homework although if you did it, it was very helpful during the beginning of the semester with the quizzes. The amount of studying you have to do to pass this class is insane with this professor, as if we don't already have other intense courses. | Thermo is a very tough subject but professor Knight made it very manageable. Alot of his explanations are very easy to follow and his weekly quizzes were very similar to the homework/class examples. The final was very odd and just seemed like it was designed to trip everyone up. There wasnt a curve but 3 of 10 quizzes are dropped which is good | Worst professor I've ever had. Makes the course insanely difficult for the quizzes really expects you to know your stuff, I feel like this class demands a lot of time and dedication to study. Gives homework but doesn't grade it, it's mostly to help you with quizzes, at first it was very helpful but during mid semester the homework just didn't help | I had this professor before for Intro to AE. He had us write essays on planes. Not only is his teaching methods ineffective, but his grading is even worse. I've compared how students did in the class in before and they had a much easier time. He makes the course material so much harder. Apparently he doesn't normally teach this course, either :/ | Lectures arent helpful, textbook is okay. Grading is fair, lets us use textbook for quizzes and exams. | really easy Byrne seminar, there's two assignments and you don't need to pay attention in class to do the assignments (although you do need to attend the lectures). one class a week for ten weeks, an easy credit all told | Does not know how to teach, only knows how to reread slides. Asked for help and he told me he cant help me. Stay away because he isnt very knowledgeable on the subject he teaches. | Professor does not help at all. His lectures are useless because he doesnt know how to teach well, got more help from a class mate who studied other material. Went to office hours for extra help, he told me that if I wanted help I would have to look elsewhere | His lectures are definitely boring. Slides are very helpful. Seems approachable. Gives a project(individual) which is definitely gonna be a positive learning experience at the end of the semester. I'd suggest, go for him. | The lectures aren't very helpful, he pretty much goes through the PowerPoints verbatim, which you can do on your own time. They are helpful if you've studied the chapter beforehand and use the time to ask questions though. Weekly quizzes and he's a pretty tough yet pretty fair grader; he expects you to know the material very well. | Nice guy, but extremely arrogant. Compressible is taught from his slides which would be fine, except he omits the figures from the downloadable slides because of ""copyright"" laws, which is BS if proper citation is used. One of the few that actually speaks clear english, however you'll have to deal with him using the phrase ""So obviously..."" a lot. | I had Prof.Knight for Propulsion and I'm taking him again for Aero. He is one of the best professors in engineering. 60% midterm and final with 40% weekly quizzes. He posted pdfs on solution and lectures to make things easy to study and comprehend. All around I think he has the best layout for teaching a class, highly recommended. | Thermo, Aerodynamics and Propulsion. 40% weekly quiz and 2 30% exams. You get out what you put in. Weekly quizzes make it so you attend class regularly and they are not very difficult. A little tough on grading especially if you tend to make stupid mistakes. | had him for almost all the aero classes i've taken so far his class structure is the same always a quiz every week based on homework that he goes over before the quiz. if you have the chance take his classes | Hes the best teacher you can have for Thermodynamics. He speaks english crystal clear and explains everything in alot of detail. He gives a quiz every week to boost attendance and they are a large portion of your grade. Really thorough and if you can take his class you definatly want to. | Horrible stay away | Knight is a very well-spoken and articulate guy who knows his stuff. He can come off as arrogant, but I think all-in-all he's a nice guy. He honestly wants everyone to understand him, and has no problem explaining concepts multiple times to ensure there is a collective understanding. Weekly quizzes, non-collected HW, Mid-Term and Final. Good guy. | Good, helpful professor. You can do well in his class as long as you have a brain | Knight is an excellent professor, of course he focus his classes on his speciality (computer modeling) and usually uses Matlab, but he's eager to help, and a good teacher. Any engineer who thinks doesn't want to learn matlab is in for a suprise in the work force. | Very intelligent man. Knows his material, but because it's Matlab, it can still be hard to follow along. But if you have to take it, it might as well be with Knight. Fair grader. | Had him for Design of mech systems and learned nothing about design. He loves matlab and computer programming thats all he taught us but we werent even in a programming class. He likes to rub his chin in thought and loves making slides. I would avoid him if you can. HE WILL NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING LATE!! He will fail you first | No Comments"
"Lee, Howon","One of the best engineering professors at Rutgers. His lectures are straight to the point and he teaches very clearly. Exams are extremely fair - only slightly more difficult than examples from class or homework. There's really no guess work with grading or in regards to whats coming on exams - as long as you do the hw. Really nice guy as well. | Hes a great and amicable guy. 3D printing class is easy but boring though. But if you extremely interested in 3D printing and the science behind it, this class is for you. He's also very knowledgeable in 3D printing and i think just overall a great and friendly guy. | Good lecturer, knows material, grades fairly. If you don't study and try to wing it you will not do well on his course. Do your homework and actually understand it instead of memorizing it. | Has very good lectures. Midterms are easy but grading is tough. | Good teacher, very clear lectures, he ACTUALLY teaches. You'll need the book at times. His exams were fair, not too difficult. I got a C by winging one so it's not too bad. | He writes his notes on the board, which are extremely important. Make sure to write down everything he goes over, especially the examples. He does get a bit dry at times. His exams are tough, but you can get a good portion of points if you can attempt to show some work. Do the hw as it will help your grade (20% I believe). | Very good lecturer (though a bit dry). He's a pretty ridiculous grader though, borderline unfair at times. No calculators or formula sheet for exams and no partial credit, sometimes won't give you any credit when you deserve it, almost seems like he grades based on mood. | Professor Howon Lee was the best engineering professor I had so far. During lectures, he goes through the proofs on how certain equations come to be and is very thorough with his explanation. His exams are very fair as well in terms of the types of questions that he chooses. You should go to all lectures in order to do well. Doesn't upload slides. | He pretty much outlines the chapters and gives you a good indication of what is going to be on the exam. Very helpful and understanding."
"Pelegri, Assimina","Mina is not the best at teaching but she is one of the best professors at Rutgers. She actually cares about the students. She is straight forward and doesn't tolerate crap from anyone. She is hard to reach but if you can manage to talk to her you will understand what I mean. I graduated a few years ago and I still talk to her for advised. | The fact that she's the only professor who thinks mandatory attendance for a morning class for 2nd semester seniors is a good idea far overshadows any good traits she might have. The lectures themselves are completely useless and she doesn't even show up half the time. She's the only one who teaches Sr design, so there's nothing you can do about it | An ok prof. She doesn't teach very well, but if you learn the material beforehand, you could benefit from the lectures. She is intimidating; you need some confidence to ask a question. Highly suggest you watch the mastering engineering videos and try to learn the material yourself. | she is okay teacher. you gotta teach ur self. her test question comes mostly out of the textbook . she can be hard and tricky. | Good teacher, talks fast, fair grader but tough. Gives you a formula sheet on the exams, but you need to study. | Rudest teacher I have ever had. Tests are unreasonably hard. | The only thing she teaches is Mechanics Of Materials. She's rather rude and doesn't take anything from anyone. Her exams are hard and she wasn't too helpful when it came to my homework problems. However you're stuck with her so deal with it. She's cool outside of class though. | One of the best professors I have ever had. The material is not the easiest if you are not willing to put in the legwork, but the professor will help you if you ask. Took attendance almost all the time. Does not allow mobiles, tablets, or computers. She will make an effort to make sure everyone learns and gives extra credit quizzes. | Mechanics of materials. Her exams are past exams. But her test are blue book and she keeps the question sheet so you have to look at the work. She always shows up late to class, is disorganized and rude to students. Her notes are sloppy and hard to understand. If you have her be prepared to teach yourself for another semester because she is no help | Great professor! She does her best to ensure that the WHOLE class is learning the material. Gives pop extra credit quizzes. Exams are relatively easy. Doesn't mind giving you minor hints during exams. And, is really really loud promise you even if you are having a hung over, Dr. Pelegri will not let you sleep! | great | The best | She's the best | Awesome teacher with and great presentation, I would take her anytime... | She's cool."
"Tse, Stephen","Of all professors I've taken so far at Rutgers, Professor Tse is top 2 worst. He's arrogant, doesn't listen to students, doesn't teach. He went on random tangents all of the time and laughed when nobody knew how to do any of the quizzes. Incredible waste of time, taught the whole class to myself. I now have a horrible foundation in thermo... | You CANNOT finesse this course. You need to put in decent/honest work into every little assignment/question to be able to grasp the bigger concepts which are predicated on and presuppose your concrete and thorough understanding of minute details. Do the homework, go to office hours, listen very carefully to his hints, hold yourself accountable. | Lectures consist of him going on long tangents and making jokes. This would be cool, but we never learned anything in lecture. During the semester,he would throw temper tantrums about our low grades, blaming us. He changed the values of homeworks and quizzes consistently,making the syllabus mean nothing and causing more stress. Biweekly quizzes | I took it in 2019, there's been some changes. Tse covers a ton of ground and does about as well as I think is possible without cutting sections. That being said, the homework takes forever - 6+ hours a week. Make heavy use of office hours and the TA. Definitely the hardest class I've taken at RU but it's possible to succeed if you put the time in. | Worst Professor ever, someone need to talk some sense into this man | Stephen believes his lectures are helpful but are filled with his bad humor and conceptuals that dont help with problem solving. Class averages for midterms were around 40 and he proceeded to blame the class of about 100 rather than his own teaching abilities. You must read the book and teach yourself. Stephen is the definition of arrogant. | Lectures are good for theory and such but they don't really line up to what is expected on the homework and exams. Doesn't do any example problems in class either. Nothing special. | Thermodynamics with Stephen Tse was the best class I took at Rutgers. He moves quickly and covers almost the entire textbook, but he explains challenging concepts in a way that makes them understandable and even enjoyable. He pushes his students but gives open book exams and an extremely generous curve that rewards those who put in the work. | Professor Tse is an amazing professor, one of the best that I had at Rutgers. He lectures well, is highly knowledgeable and accessible outside of class, and wants to see students succeed. His tests are straightforward and open book; if you put the time into familiarizing yourself with the material, you will pass easily. Highly recommended. | Great professor, very helpful. | Thermodynamics, Awesome teacher! Open book tests with a formula sheet. HW is 20% Midterms are 25% and final is 30%. Curves are still huge though! He's a really good teacher who makes the material fun and understandable. Wish more engineering professors were like him. attendance is not mandatory though he will give pop quizzes rarely. | Very knowledgeable about everything. Heat transfer is a difficult subject but I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else. | Really not the greatest teacher. Doesn't do any example problems and lecture is only deriving equations and such, with an occasional funny story. I learned everything from the book, which is helpful. | Really Smart and knows his stuff. his style of teaching is different. not so many examples but all concepts. he challenges you. overall pretty good | Best Teacher for thermo, wouldn't take it with anyone else! | Best professor ever...PERIOD! | Ok here u go engineers!! if you want to pass heat transfer ot Thermodynamics make sure u take Tse...he gives tons of partia credict.. open book exams.. plus one sheet of notes... he knows his material really well.. he is young and can relate to the average college student... he majes class fun...with dumb side notes... | The material of the course itself is hard, but Stephen tries to make it fun for the students. He's a teacher I wont fall asleep to, and he knows what he's talking about, which sometimes seems like it isn't the case with some profs. And he's cute, if you like azn guys. | I found the class very easy. He's very helpful and his exams are very fair. He gives lots of partial credit I actually got credit on a problem which i used the wrong formula. Definately take his class for heat transfer if you can I heard horror stories from othe professors who teach it. Its not the most intresting subject but he tries to make it"
"Rossi, Todd","In my entire college career, I have never taken a course as disorganized as Internal Combustion Engines. It's pretty clear that Rossi has no interest in teaching at all. | The best professor I ever had. | He didnt teach anything just used recordings from previous semesters. We would go in for lectures but would not teach just discuss the project we were working on and try to find ways to kill 80 minutes. The TA did all the grading and gave no partial credit. The class is easy, but the grading was very harsh. Curve is used which saved everyones grade | Although he is a kind and caring professor, exams are heavily graded and contain lots of fundamental short answer questions followed by four to five longer calculation problems. The fact is there are too many problems in the exam that we do not have enough time to solve all them within 1hour 20 minutes. | I totally disagree with the low ratings here. The HWs are pretty lengthy , but he basically gives you the solutions. He's flexible on deadlines. Exams are taken right from HW. The class wastes zero time on derivations. You will actually learn how to analyze real wind turbine and solar panel data. One of the most interesting classes in MAE. | Todd is a really nice person. Genuinely cares about the students. Sad part: he can't teach well. Super test heavy. weekly exam avgs in 50-70s. New chapter every week. Given the absolute difficulty in the material, too much was tasked in one week. Didn't learn much. Giving him a 4 for the generous curve & we were able to advocate for a better grade. | He read everything directly from our textbook, including examples, instead of actually teaching the material. He wasn't able to answer 90% of student's questions. He couldn't solve most of the homework problems without looking at the solutions. He took away partial credit on exams after the TA had trouble looking at all of them by himself. | Doesnt understand the material hes teaching pretty much sums it up. Youll have to learn completely on your own, just think of tuition as a bill for a meal you cooked yourself. | Professor Rossi is a great example of unrealized potential. He is an industry professional and interested in improving, though he puts way too much weight on tests (90% in our case). He makes PDFs summarizing each module and necessary equations, but they are fairly barebones and does not do problems on the board (only scrolls through the pdf) | Professor is a nice person, shame he can't teach. | I agree with the below review, you learn nothing at all in class. He goes over one sentence topics in each chapter without going into any detail whatsoever. He did maybe 3 problems on the board all semester, and when we asked him the first time it was like some foreign concept to him. However, hes a really nice guy and compromises with the student | Class wasn't hard, already signed up for my last two electives with him. Easy and thorough lectures, gave textbook problems for hw, went over material multiple times before each exam. Pretty straight forward professor, cares about what he teaches. Hardest part was familiarizing with excel procedures used for one hw and final project | Professor Rossi truly doesn't care about being a professor. He grades none of his own exams and refuses to meet with students about grade discrepancies. Lectures are worthless to the point 30/120 students show up. His ""Notes"" are the textbook section review and he does not do any example problems at all for the class. Leavine students unprepared"
"Tutwiler, Valerie","She is a great teacher who engages students through class discussions showing she is very passionate and clearly cares for them. You have to work very hard on papers, but she is very helpful during office hours and really nice lady. You will definitely be prepared for expos if you take basic comp with her. | best prof you can get at Rutgers, take her course you will get better in Expo | Professor Tasiran is laid back and shes very understanding. As for her grading I would say that its pretty fair. Its kind of impossible to get an A in the class and she said it herself because that will mean that you should be in expository writing and not in basic composition. She's a professor for both classes but I only had her for basic comp. | Shes amazing. Ive been writing my whole life but I was forced into expos as a transfer. I was expecting it to be boring, but she made it interesting and I learned a lot. Shes patient and kind and extremely inspirational. I adored her class even if I was forced into it. | She's a great teacher, gives great lecture. But you will have to prepare well for the quiz if you want to get a 90-ish on the quiz. Also, she's a picky reader, make sure to really invest in your essays before submitting. | She's amazing. In each class she lectures on how to improve your writing and if you take into consideration all her feedback and read the text you can see improvement in your papers. | Really nice and awesome as a person, but when it comes to teaching, she is not really specific with what she wants, more so of a generic professor. I recommend taking this course with someone else."
"Muzzio, Fernando","TAKE him he is the best so much extra credit and talk to him he likes you more, go to class most of the time, but GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! you get help and the hw! ***Also DO NOT buy the book you don't need it, if you want to get an A in this class get help from him, office hours, , READ his slides and make friends trust me | It's a comp sci class so obviously it won't be easy. But he's your best bet to get an A. He really cares and will help you as long as you're respectful and actually care too. | Best Comp apps teacher at rutgers. Truly a nice guy who cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Recitation is mandatory attendance but lectures aren't. His slides are vague so be sure to pay attention to what hes saying about them in lecture. Used the textbook to supplement what I learned, not to teach myself. Do the HW! | good dude. do extra credit | LOVE HIM!!!!!! He has AMAZING Slides, I saw the slides for other professors for CS 170 and they were nothing compared to Geraci's! He offers alot of help outside the classroom and extended review sessions, and he answers questions through email and during his office hours! He gave alot of extra credits which bumped my grade up! MUST TAKE | Fernando was one the best professors I've had so far here. His lectures are amazing and gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. He is a must take! | The best professor to take for comp apps he's great and cares about his students. Classes aren't boring, he jokes around and if you participate he'll respect you he likes to get to know his students. Extra credit opportunities, there to help you when you need it, and he's cute (super charming accent). | Amazing professor. TAKE HIM FOR COMP APPS! A lot of extra credit opportunities and really helps out his students. He really goes out of his way to help out. | Really cares about his students. Easily the best professor to take for Computer Applications for Business at Rutgers. All around good dude. | He is one of the best professors that I have taken at Rutgers. He really goes out of his way to make sure his students do great. Take him, and you will not be disappointed, he really tries and does his best. Also he's a really great person that loves to joke around. | you have assignments due every week. of all of the comp apps teachers, he is def the best. he has a busy schedule, but always replies to emails or questions you have. he really cares about his students. | Super helpful, sweet, and passionate about the subject. Just make sure not to fall behind, or class can become hard. | To put it into perspective. People in other sections of this course came to hear Prof. Geraci's lectures. Of all the options he is the best. He is friendly and fair. The course isn't an easy ""A"", but that's because they keep changing things, and he does what he can to help students out. You need the textbook, but reading before class is optional."
"Wang, Ruoqian","I mean he is a great guy. Def recommend, the only thing is his exams are hard. You need to study hard for his exams but he is a great guy. | 3 hard exams, each 30%. 10 percent homework. Just a few questions on each exam for extra credit which are impossible to answer. No dropping of lowest grade or anything to help your grade. Average for each exam is around 75-76. A B would be over 80 in his class. So 60-65 percent will get a grade lower than a B. No curve. Horrible lecturer. | Worst professor that Ive ever had in college so far. Refuses to provide practice problems, examples or homework. Consistently makes errors in his calculations and solutions. Reads off his slides. Unable to answer students most of the time by saying I dont understand your question. Im not sure and etc. gives very unclear and confusing exams. | I enjoyed the class with Dr. Wang. The class project was a lot of work but it was a great experience in coding and data analysis | He taught Engineering Analysis Tools my year. He's very flexible and understanding, and doesn't grade hard at all. His lectures are nothing special but he does make sure everyone keeps up. His projects are pretty easy but if you have any trouble go to him during office hours or after class and he'll basically walk you through it."
"Balaguru, Perumalsamy","Very generous professor. always ready to help. teaches like an actual teacher should teach. always willing and eager to listen to your questions. one must take at least one of his subjects to experience the real joy of learning. and he is at his best when he teaches advanced reinforced concrete. | Go to class, take notes, do homework, and you'll pass. Quite honestly one of the best teachers in the department. Everything is given to you in class through notes and nothing posted online so make sure you go to class. He also talks about real life applications of material learned. Solid professor and you'll learn | This guy actually TEACHES! He's old school and all (no powerpoint presentations, writes on the board, etc.) but you actually learn. He stresses the theory vs. getting the numbers (anyone can plug numbers into a formula). I woul take him for more if I could but I seem to have taken everything he teaches. | There is a lot of material but the professor doesn't try to trick you and does a good job explaining it. Exams are pretty straight forward but he doesn't give much partial credit. All in all it is a difficult class but it is doable. And yes he does say ""Just Do It"" a lot. | Guru is a good guy. Had him for reinforced concrete. Excellent teacher and usually available to answer questions during office hours. Loves to say things like ""Just Do It"" and ""Write it on the paper and DO IT!!!"" He's a really nice guy though and also the Graduate Director. | just ok"
"Najm, Husam","Professor Najm is by far the best Professor I've taken at Rutgers. He's one of the rare professors that actually care about his students and making sure they understand the material. | Best professor I have ever had, made me want to pursue structural design | Amazing teacher, knows what he's doing and can present the material in a concise manner. Go to him with any questions and he'll take the time to explain things to you. Very helpful and very kind. He's someone you'll appreciate having as a professor. | I have had najm for 3 courses over 2 years. His notes in class were very clear and helpful and he was very easy to communicate with outside of class. He is eager to answer questions and gives excellent feedback. He never makes you feel stupid when asking questions or having difficulty. | Great Great Professor Dr. Najm. he will combine theory with application which is utmost important for civil engineering. Not only as a professor, he is the nicest man i have ever met so generous always available for students and ready to help. Even if you dont like structural engineering, you will begin to love the subjects that he teach | If Dr. Najm is teaching the class, take it! | Greatest Civil Professor at Rutgers | I had Dr. Najm 11 years ago, and reading these comments make me happy. I have seen he has not changed. I have him for both structures and steel design and was by far the best professor at RU. I would take him again tomorrow if given the change. What a gentleman. | select without thinking | The best professor in CE department. Pray you have him for structural analysis and design. Material for this class can get hard but he explains it so well that you will understand it. One of the nicest professors I have had. | 130 credits. 42 different professors. This guy was the best. | he is oneof the gretest people that I met during my entire life | The best professor even. Smart, thorough, dedicated and sharp. | Had him for structures. I would say he was my favorite professor so far at Rutgers. Always in a good mood, easy to understand and very helpful. He addresses any concerns students have. | He is great guy and I enjoyed in his class | The first time I met Professor Najm I knew he was an exceptional person. Now that I have him for class I realize his expertise and professionalism are unmatched. | Extremely lucid lecturer with a very real and apparent desire to teach the course material effectively. Great in office hours and extremely accessible. | Najm is the man. He's always willing to answer questions after class or at his office hours. He is nice, polite and always in a good mood. Subject is pretty tough but najm is a great help, ask him what you don't get and he will explain it perfectly. Best prof I've had at Rutgers. | good teacher. the final was impossible | great guy | Without a doubt, the best TEACHER in the CE department. You will LEARN from him, both textbook knowledge and how to apply it to real world problems. He is very helpful and provides crystal clear examples on how the theory works. His classes seem easy simply because he presents the information to you superbly. The subject material is NOT though! | Best Civil Engineering professor you could have at Rutgers. He is always prepared for class and will help you as much as possible with questions in class and office hours. If only every other CE professor was like him. | NAJ is the greatest Civil Engineering teacher HANDS DOWN. He is the man.....excellenet teacher, extremely helpful during class and office hours. The nicest guy you could ever meet. He is an excellent teacher and pray you have him for structural analysis/indeterminate structures/steel design. | Best CE Professor by far - You can understand the material no matter how difficult it is to understand. He's very knowledgeable about the subject and great to talk to - gives good advice! | Best CE professor. Even if the class is hard he makes it understandable and always gives clear examples and help. You can pass his classes if you go to class and take his notes. | NASTY NAJ!! | excellent professor. gave plenty of examples. clear/concise/accessible. always willing to help. and very polite when you run into him on campus. the best prof i've had at rutgers. | Hands down, best Civil Engineering prof at Rutgers. Makes the material understandable, and with moderate studying can do very well in his class. | THE best professor in the CE Dept. Get this man on your good side. He's practiced engineering for 10 years in addition to teaching it (unlike the rest of the staff) so he really knows what you need to know. | Great Professor; gives out HW every week, but do-able for the most part, exams are pretty straightforward | Excellant professor, good grader, very helpful and very supportive... | Excellent teacher. Very helpful. Very supportive of the students. | Very Helpful, Great Teacher, gives you all the time you need | No Comments | No Comments | One of the best teachers the CE depatment has."
"Jin, Jing","Hes the worst professor Ive had so far. Really fast talker, Homework is tough and Grades are harsh. Dont take this guy | His brain works at light speed. Fast dense lectures, and BRUSH UP on Mechatronics. Course content includes vibrations. 10 HWs (very time intensive, one dropped), 2 exams + final (25/25/35%). Control theory is genuinely difficult content, but if you accept that, you can appreciate Dr. Yi. Highly knowledgeable and accessible outside class. | He's the expert in robotics - no surprise he moves fast through the lectures. This semester he eased up over years prior. I only achieved a B thanks to grading: dropping a HW, extra credit on exams. Power points are make-or-break as they distinguish what's important. The course scope is huge but he's here to help. Reach out and he'll assist you. | So admittedly the course is very hard, despite this Professor Yi does his absolute best to communicate the material effectively, providing us with HWs and previous exams which were comparable to the exams he gave. Professor Yi also grades and curves quite generously. he does examples in class which are pretty important, go to office hours, it helps | Professor teaches so fast that I pretty much learned nothing from this class. Your entire grade is based on ten HW assignments, two midterm exams, and one final exam, all of which are extremely difficult and confusing. No wonder the minimum passing grade for the course was between 20-30%. | Tests are hard. The pace of lectures is VERY fast, therefore the lectures are confusing. Overall tough class and the professor doesn't help, however, he gives a bunch of examples in class which he goes over very fast so you don't learn anything | A lot of things wrong with this class...Grade only consists of HW & tests. HWs r graded harshly, tests don't align with hw&practice exams and he also puts weird definition problems there. Only way to get it right is to copy the lecture note to your cheat sheet. It's a waste of time, makes zero sense in terms of learning/understanding the material. | Extremely caring and nice professor, but the class was tough. He acknowledged that a lot of us had poor Dynamics and Mechatronics experiences and tried his best to fill us in. Does plenty of examples during lecture, but lectures can be a bit fast and confusing. Exams were very difficult but curves. | one of the worst proffesor at rutgers, may God have mercy on us. | Not a good professor. | The professor is not very clear with the teaching. Also expects a lot from the students. A good professor but hard to meet his requirements. | Really like this professor as he is very smart and knows many related stuff. He rocks! | Dr. Yi teaches and speaks very quickly, almost like he's talking to himself outloud. Seems to have no interest in helping or giving extra review sessions. His student expectations are way to high, he explains things as if you know the material already. | Very difficult to understand all around. He's a nice guy, but that doesn't help me learn anything. | dr yi seems like a smart guy but is totally incomprehensible. he expects way too much from you. take with dr moon if you can."
"Mcgarvey, John","Simply amazing, I've never seen a professor who goes above and beyond for his students like he does. | Professor McGarvey should be the example that all other ECE professors strive to be. This man explains things thoroughly and thanks to his numerous years working in industry he can relate examples to real world applications. His grading scheme is extremely fair especially thanks to the numerous projects. BY FAR THE BEST ECE PROFESSOR. | Easily one of the best professors I've had, He gives extensions when he sees that the class is behind and provide extra video lectures to make sure you understand the material. | Probably one of the best professors I have had so far. He actually cared about us doing well and was willing to give as much help as we needed. He always answered as many questions as he could. He was a little slower as to his older age, but other than that he was funny and lectures were fine. He was easy to contact and discuss topics with. | Good lectures with supplementary tools on canvas."
"Wei, Sheng","Best Professor for CompArch, no midterms or finals, only quizzes and its almost identical to HW. Although the grading is very picky, he drops a HW and a quiz, so its almost impossible to fail. I didn't take PM1 before and still managed to do well, although Lab is crazy without a C background."
"El Rouayheb, Salim","The class overall is very engaging. From my personal experience, Professor El Rouayheb is great at explaining the material and walking through examples. If you practice and attend lectures with interest, you will do well. That being said, the material can be hard at times, and the group homework can be difficult to manage. | If you put in the effort you will pass. The material of the class is extremely difficult but you just have to take the time to truly understand the material. | Terribe Prof dont take at all costs. Literally just take it another semester or even take the comp sci version. He just reads off slides and the exams are so much more difficult then the homeworks. | Do not make the same mistake as me. Take the Computer Science alternative (Intro to Discrete Structures) instead. Awful lecturer and extremely rude. Exams are unnecessarily difficult. His class tanked my GPA. | If you can read the slides you best believe he can too and thats all he'll ever ever do. Extremely condescending and rude, he will always make you feel below him just because you don't understand, I think he enjoys this. Super political and loves to share off topic opinions and passes them off as ""jokes."" Just avoid his class at all costs. | DO NOT, I REPEAT, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE AT ALL. You're better off switching majors than having your GPA tank take this class. Worst professor I have had throughout my college career. Does not care about questions, thinks every question asked is a dumb question yet does not answer it. Absolutely shows no remorse to students nor cares. | DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!!! Worst professor on the planet. Does not know how to teach. You will not learn a single thing in his class. His grading policy is outlandish. Guaranteed failure if you take this professor. | Horrible. You learn nothing | The worst prof I've ever seen. Grading policy is unfair. Don't take his course. | He is very rude, if you walk a little late to class, hell stop lecturing and stare at you. His exams are very hard but the final is quite easy. midterm averages are around high 40s. The topics in the class are very relatable and real useful math but its very hard to grasp, get ready to study class slides since lectures are useless. Huge CURVE | This class was a nightmare since the exams and quizzes were super hard. His favorite phrase was ""This is Discrete Math"". If you really want to pass go to the TA's office hours and spend a good time doing problems so you can learn the logic of how to solve problems in the exam and quizzes. Generous curve. If you can avoid him do it."
"Aliari Zonouz, Saman","Frankly, this is the best professor the ECE department has to offer. He was accessible outside class and prepared well his lectures, which contained many valuable original insights. The slides were very recent and of his own. He was very invested in running the course and connecting his students, and the TAs almost had to do nothing. :-D | Probably the most difficult online class I have taken before, just because of the lack of effort from the professor. He just reads the MIT lecture slides. | Hasn't written a line of code during the entire semester. I'm convinced he's only here to do research and they just forced him to teach. Uses MIT lecture slides from 2005 and tells you to look online in order to learn different Data Structures instead of showing them in class. TA's were painfully lacking in knowledge and didn't give good feedback | Professor really goes out of his way to show that he does not care about teaching at all. Writes in the syllabus that you cannot email him and he throws all the work on his TA's who also show they couldn't care less. The professor doesn't make the TESTS or HOMEWORK so if you ask him for help, he'll throw you to the TA's which are hit or miss. AWFUL | Avoid him for any class. Lectures are useless. Be aware of Pop Quizzes..... | The worst professor ever. I hope he sees this and realizes how many lives has he been spoiling by teaching. How can a person who copies all MIT lectures and cannot even make his own notes expect us to learn everything. I bet he doesn't know even 10% of what he teaches from MIT. He gave us a booklet of 20 pages as the final exam LOL | Lecture slides are straight from the MIT course on algorithms. Is vague about details concerning the course and its exams. Goes out of his way to not be helpful (his syllabus asks you not to email him and he doesn't answer questions in lecture) and he extends this behavior to his TA's too. | Useless lectures, very disorganized course- straight from MIT. Rutgers students go to Rutgers not MIT. Exams are pretty easy, but his lectures are out of this world. | Boring to listen to. Explains nothing clearly. Erratic pop quizzes. Uses MIT material which is a free course online with better professors and resources. By all means avoid. | PM1 I have taken this professor's course in the spring of 2016 and he seems like a newer professor. There was a lot of homeworks and a lot of quizzes. There is an extensive use of slides in this class. Two exams. | Despite previous reviews, I think Zonous has become more understanding to students. He's very accomplished but I feel that he should slow down the pace so students can understand. He prepares you for interviews via videos at the end of some lectures. Do your due diligence for this class and don't skip lectures. He's fair to diligent students. | uh course just started, this class is awful and he just reads the slides. gonna be rough. | By far the worst professor ever. Extremely disorganized, very lazy to make his own exams just takes them from other ivy league universities . Can't even teach the material properly, this is all a self learning class. I did will cause i had prior experience if you don't have experience in c++ do not take it with this professor | Extremely disorganized class structure, changes his mind about grading and assignments constantly. He seems to think that our only classes are this and the lab, expect to do 8+ hours of work per week minimum. Also he seems to think it's useful for us to memorize functions instead of understanding them. Avoid at all costs. | My word of advise, take the CS route. Just do yourself the favor and learn Java instead of learning C++ with this professor, ESPECIALLY if your only programming experience if from MATLAB."
"Lu, Yicheng","Professor Lu is the worst teacher in the ECE department. Doesn't know how to teach and never communicates well during lecture. Take this class with another Professor, don't waste your $ on Lu, he is hopeless. He recycled recitations from last year, disorganized during lecture, and he thinks students are all super smart. Much harder than PEE 1/2 | Not the best for online courses. Online lectures were very rough. I survived using the textbook and google. The content was pretty diluted. The course was heavily oriented around lab but labs were never done in person due to covid. Disappointing educational experience. I would consider taking another course with him in person though. | He talks more about how much you need to study and how much of a loser you are than actually teaching anything valuable and helpful. His quiz questions are straight out of homework questions and midterm is ROUGH!!! his final this year wasn't too bad and very similar to homework questions. Great curve and but STUDY THE BOOK YOURSELF!! | Wastes half of every lecture telling you how stupid you are, and how generous he is. Far from it. His lectures were not helpful. The book is infinitely better. Don't expect knowing how to complete your labs, because he's always behind schedule due to wasting lecture time. Perhaps if he spent less time belittling students, he'd be better. | Thick to Thin is the key to pass this class. He is funny. Lu gives fair quizzes that are very similar from the homework problems. If you do average or well on the quizzes and the midterm, you don't have to worry for the final since its 50%. Either way the final will kill your grade but you will still do good. There's a huge curve at the end. | I did not do good in midterms but final worth 50% of grade and I did well enough to raise my grade to B+, thank you Prof. Lu! | Being in class didn't really help me at all. The only way I passed the class was by reading the book. The textbook has everything, make sure you do all the examples and homework. I did super well on the first midterm had a A/B+ range, and then the final knocked my grade down and the final is worth 50%, so make sure you prepare well in advance. | Unhelpful lectures. The textbook helped me pass this course. Get ready to get attacked by the 50% final, which you WILL do bad in. | It's okay to be late to class but make sure to go to class, because he will generally spend 20 min talking about philosophy. Lu is great as long as you put enough effort into this class. | He taught me everything from thick to thin. Vice versa, thin to thick. The three fundamental B's. Basic concepts, basic approach, and basic problems. The **TRIANGLE**, Professor Lu's Lecture Example, Homework Problems, Textbook Example. Mechanical memory will not help you in this class, professor Lu advises you to use thick to thin. Love LU. | He's one of the best professors in the ECE department. If you worked hard in P.E.E I and II and really have your fundamentals down, this class isn't that hard. However, if you struggled in the pre-req classes and don't put effort into improving on that, you will suffer in this class. Just do his homework problems and examples and you're set. | Electronic devices is one of the hardest classes for an ECE major. Also, if you struggled with PEE-1 and PEE-2, I'm sorry but here's sympathy for your soul as this is harder. Lu's notes are incredibly useful SO DON""T SKIP CLASS AND TAKE NOTES, and make sure to do the homework (not collected) each week. Most of his exam questions are from the book | I find his lecture really hard to understand, because he usually goes straight into problem without giving the overview of the problem. I think it's better to read and do problems in the book myself. Quizes are very easy, exams are more challenging. This is a very difficult course. Be prepare to study like a dog. | This man cares about the success of his students. Students typically don't do well on his quizzes, and he ends up wasting a major chunk of class time lecturing the students about their poor performance. If he didn't spend so much time scolding students they would learn more, not to mention the fact that it's to understand him because of his ascent. | The good: Prof. Lu cares about his students and is passionate about their success. He knows the material and is always on time. The bad: Prof. Lu is not very clear when explaining. He often cuts off a students question with the answer, and often answers a different question than was asked. Accent is difficult for some to understand. | His tests and quizzes are straight forward if you just do a lot of example problems throughout the semester. But the final exam is complete overkill. I was at around a B+ average and the final knocked me down to a C+. But there is a massive curve at the end. | He is hard to understand but only tests the material he covered in class and often hints at whats going to be tested (make sure you go to class). The quizzes and tests are not hard at all but if you mess up, you'll beat yourself up because they are actually very simple. You just have to do as many example/hw problems as you can and you'll be fine. | love him, Lu is the best. | Great professor, He is amazing. | GOOD PROFESSOR just hard to understand at times and would never let you really finish a sentence. if you honestly just do all of the h.w you will be fine. Very fair, sometimes can be rude but one of the best ECE professors | He is goofy, hard to understand, he is better off babysitting kids in the kindergarten. Very difficult to understand and want students to bolster his ego. He talks so much and will not let you talk (I always complemented his silly stories, this is why I did well in the course. Avoid him at all cost if you can. | He mumbles all the times, hard to understand. Did not learn a thing in his class, I will be glad to see him retire or go fishing...His TAs are more helpful than him, avoid him at all cost. | Wow, most difficult class ive ever taken so far. Please do not wait last minute to study for his exams. His final exam is also brutal, I saw kids tearing and biting their nails and sniffling. His curve is pretty good. Get friendly with the TAs, they can help you pass. | Midterm exams and quizes do nothing to prepare you for the final. Writes too small on the board to be legible and doesn't talk through his work. Skip lecture and read the book: you'll do better, but watch out for his extremely harsh grading. | One of the best professors in ECE | one of the best professors in ECE department. Goes over theory well, then goes over problems as well. Good teacher, good class, wish i did better in it. Remember: go from thin to thick, then back to thin. | No Comments"
"Sehajpal, Sumati","Sumati is good but her lecture is awfuel. It seems she expect everyone in her class study 30+ hours per week for this course. And she keep making mistakes in formula and homeworks. Her exams will sometimes have problem outside the range she claimed. If her courses are not needed to graduate I would not take any of her course. | I have seen some negative ratings for Professor Sehajpal lately but I can't understand why. She provides general video lectures plus a set of prewritten slides so you can fill them in while watching her videos. She also has videos that are organized by topic and some answers to student questions. She also answers emailed questions quickly. | Good teacher. She is teaching the class online and provides general video lectures plus a set of prewritten lecture slides so you can fill them in while watching her videos. She also has lectures that are organized by topic and some that are answers to student questions. I'm not saying she is easy but she is fair and she knows the material. | She only has 1 office hour a week, does not follow the textbook, and if you ask for clarification or additional resources/ problems to help you better understand the material, she just tells you to look at her lectures. Our class average is somewhere around 45-55, but she keeps saying there will be a curve. Avoid if you can, good luck if you cant! | Sumati is nice, but her ability to convey difficult concepts is lacking. She rushes through the material, doesnt give nearly enough time for tests. She doesnt provide clear explanations for homework questions( in which there is frequently errors) and will throw up material on quizzes/tests that she barely went over. Avoid her if you can. | Considering I've had A's in most of my ece classes i've never struggled with a class so much. Tests and quizzes are nothing close to the hw and are beyond difficult. She goes through important topics very fast and never clarifies them well. Expect to study at least 30 hours a week to get even 60s on quizzes. If you have to take this class goodluck. | I did not like her lecture style. You are pretty much forced to follow a template with notes. The way the lecture is formatted is also a bit disorienting. My most common question in lec is what and why are we doing something, which should be visually expressed better. Material is super easy once understood. HW often had inaccuracy in solutions. | Lectures can be overwhelming. However, the way she teaches requires you to review every week in a consistent matter and ask questions/clarifications. Doing so, the next lectures will be that much more easier to understand. This isn't the normal class where you can study last two weeks before the exam. It's just not possible. Don't do it. | Do not take expect you have to or you are insane. All of lectures, quizzes and exams are copied from other universities. And changed some values to make the problems nonsense. Really hard final with mean 50. Thats not students' problem. | Professor Sumati is a good professor , her notes are actually very organized but the problem is that she doesn't upload them online , so you have to attend class to get notes or maybe get them from a friend. Her exams aren't hard but she doesn't provide enough practice so try to do homework problems by yourself even if she doesn't require that. | Not sure which class the previous reviewer took but professor Sehajpal is very well organized. She provides nicely organized pre-lecture slides that you can use to fill in during the lectures. She gives review sessions before midterm 1 and final. Her exams are fair and if you've studied, you can surely do well. | totally disorgainzed slides and lecture. the thing is not that hard but she somewhat magically can change it into complicated staff. you can not follow her logic in the lecture, please avoid her unless you have strong related background. | Took her for EEE and had a pretty good experience. She explained things really well in class and uploaded slides with her notes for you to review. If you had a question she would be more than happy to go back and explain. Quizzes and tests were pretty fair. Very nice professor and cared about her students! | Her notes are very confusing and difficult to comprehend. She also goes through concepts way too fast. Material really isn't that hard, it's just the way she teaches that makes it so. If you are good at blindly writing stuff down and then understanding what the notes mean later, then her teaching style suits you. | Her class is totally disorganized and she clearly knows what the things are but she fails on teaching. I would rather read my book than taking her class. Besides, she makes the class become a note-copying class., totally meaningless for learning. | She uses the tough-love approach and it kept me honest. If you don't know your stuff in class, you will get intellectually grilled. To study for exams, understanding lecture notes is paramount. Class is hard, but very doable and there's a big fat curve. For reference, I took ED twice and I still managed to ace DE on the first try. Anyone can do it. | If you are self-study guy, DON'T take her classes. Homework is unhelpful because exam is totally different than homework. Her slides will not post online so you must attend lecture. Major of homework problems are not in exam. Some tricky parts she spent about 20min on class will be in exam. Totally confused to prepare exam. Don't take her class. | Dont take her class if you want even a little fun in your life along with study. She assumes that students are only having her class not having any other courses and expects unbelievable work from us. Moreover,she goes way too fast in lectures its almost impossible to grasp that much fast,She has stopped giving lectures slides with stupid reason | Although Sumati did reinforce topics that were taught during lectures she often singled out students and didn't review topics that would be on the quizzes. She was a horrific grader, expecting problems to be done ""her way""& would get offended if students were to laugh or have fun in class, so make sure you never talk, giggle, or smile in her class. | Had for as a Calculus 135 TA and she was amazing. My professor during lecture was hard to understand, but Sumati did an amazing job teaching the material. She did problems that were exactly like the quiz after recitation so it was a guarantee 100%. Great TA and in many cases better than the actual professor. Takes pride in what she teaches. | The best lab instructor we have had in the ECE department! She knows how to use every test instrument in the lab and she explains them to the students. When the experiments don't work she can quickly find and explain the problem. Her grading is very fair, she is always available during her office hours, and she carefully grades the lab reports."
Ortiz Jorge,"60% of the grade is determined by Quizes he has not remorse for his students and seems to only hope on their downfall, he gives quizzes that are far beyond what an introductory course could be able to handle. We had quizzes consisting of 30 plus pages with only 120 minutes, virtually impossible to complete, average is around a 35 for a C | grading criteria 4 ""Quizzes"" -60% Lab -10% Participation -10% 2 Projects -20% First class, someone said his office hours were when most - if not all - students had PEE2 (eng. class), and he said ""that's not my problem."" This projects are hard, he takes off 40% if your project doesn't compile through the autograder. This is not an ""INTRO"" class. | His class is really well run with the minus the projects. Exams and Labs are well made and help understanding, but the projects require far greater prowess than anything else in the class. Just getting everything up and running to be able to start the project can be a nightmare if you aren't familiar with C development. He's still solid though | Awful awful professor. Decent guy but terrible projects with no direction. Lazy with assignments and tests. | Easily my worst prof. Class is ""INTRO"" to C and the first coding class in ECE. He starts w/ advanced topics and breaks them down. This only works if the person has prior coding knowledge (Im lucky I do but my friends dont, had to teach them everything). Grades are 2 months behind. Hes also stuck up and will tell you hes an MIT grad and hes humble. | He simply can't teach, I had to self learn every single thing in this class, he also doesn't care about students. He gave us 3 HARD projects, and expected ALOT from us while he didn't give or put enough effort in the class. Definitely needs improvement, and I would never take him again although I got an A. | If you're in it for the grade strictly, he's a great professor. He makes the projects and exams relatively easy to get >90. Also, there is a curve on the exams (84+ is A). The lectures are dry, but you don't have to go. The projects and HWs take probably an afternoon. Exam questions are confusingly and clumsily worded. | This is the worst professor that I have ever had in my entire life. | I absolutely hated coding after this class, Lectures are extremely heavy, we didn't learn much, and tests were too hard, they literally had nothing to do with what we did in class. He also doesn't care about students at all. I hope the best for him, but I simply hate the way he teaches and presents the materials. He skipped really important topics. | Do yourself a favor. I don't usually do this, but this guy was so bad I had no choice. LIKE PLEASE. DO. NOT. DO. IT. He went to MIT and he'll let you know that every day. He'll try to make you feel like you did too. | Does not sympathize with students. Class got an average of 30 on the first midterm and he boasts about how no one could do well onhis exams"
"Striki, Maria","The reviews of her are very accurate. If possible avoid at all costs. Tough exams, no outside resources to learn her material, impossible to understand, answer keys are wrong and don't match lecture. Everything feels random; I didn't end up learning much at all and her curve was not that big either. However, she is somewhat helpful in office hours. | She is the first professor I've had who manages to make a complicated topic even more difficult to understand. Lectures are confusing and not worth going to except for quizzes, the slides fail to emphasize the most vital topics and often contain conflicting statements, and overall not a good professor for this highly technical class. | Striki cares about her students. You won't fail her courses if you give effort. That being said, her lectures are confusing, homework is unsolvable without hours of extra research, & she. just. doesn't. stop. with. the. assignments. Felt like a semester of busy-work. Expect HW, projects, quizzes, midterms, papers, and labs. No, that is not a joke. | She was very confusing and it was a struggle to understand the content. I recommend you teach yourself and make friends. Just take one step at a time and don't forget about the projects. Get capable group members. It may benefit to just have one other group member that you trust rather than 2 or three that you aren't sure about. | She is an angel, the savior of ECE students' GPAs with all her extra credit and lenient grading. She noticed students were struggling on the midterms so made homework most of the grade, which she goes through similar examples in class. You will never take a professor better than Striki in ECE, the true inspiration to all of us engineering students. | She is caring and really does want the best for her students. However that is the only good thing about her class. Her exams/quizzes were way harder than necessary. Class was disorganized and lecture was confusing. Projects and Homework were way harder than necessary and I honestly don't think I have learnt much from her class. Better to avoid. | Her lectures are crystal clear and shes very easy to understand with her explanations. The material is super interesting and fundamental if you want to be an electrical engineer. It's all Risc-V, binary arithmetic, and processor and pipelining. Her exams are very much on the same level with her homework and the class examples. | Striki is a very caring professor. She wants her students to do well and learn. She is very nice to her students but is often put under a lot of stress. She will not fail you if you give an effort and reach out to her. The reason for her bad reviews is not her as a person, but rather as a professor. Big difference, unfortunately she can't teach!!!! | Grading criteria and due dates for assignments were always unclear from day one. Does not reply to student emails. And good luck trying to find something specific from her class notes as they're all in one 300 slide long PowerPoint. Homework and quizzes were way more in-depth than anything she discussed during lectures. Find a different professor. | There wasn't enough time in any of the quizzes or exams. in the final, people got 2,3, etc out of 42. the smart kid got an 11. Also, people got a 2 but when asked ""11 is the lowest grade"" :/ | She is one of those professors who writes her exams knowing students will not be able to finish and so she will need to curve accordingly. She also assigned so much work: we had projects, homework, presentations, quizzes, and exams. Her projects and homework took up to 12 hours PER QUESTION. The due dates would overlap as well, beware | Good luck taking this class, its 15 weeks of straight confusion for you and the teacher. She quite often sends out assignments(HW, QUIZZES, ETC)much later than originally intended and never gives us a reason why. | If at all possible I recommend that you avoid taking any classes with striki. Everything she does she means well, but she cannot teach. On top of that she has horrible timing issues. Dont worry a 30% will get you a B | This class has been a solid 15 weeks of straight confusion, shes very nice and means well, but wow... Youll come into this class knowing less then what you went in with | How do I put this... I can tell that she cares about the class, and that she's also having a tough time. However, she has little concept of timing. Exams can and have been delayed due to her tardiness. Again, she has valid reasons for it, but it's not right at all. Also, she isn't the best at communicating. And you might receive messages at 3 am... | She is a really nice person, but I don't think she should be allowed to teach. Expect her being late to lecture/posting assignments and frequent errors on tests. This class was without a doubt the most unclear, confusing and useless 15 weeks I have ever experienced. The professor needs to overhaul every facet of this class just for it to be decent. | Professor Striki is a very nice person. However, as a professor, that is about all she has going for her. Avoid her for any class she teaches, you will get nothing out of it and suffer through it the entire way. On the first day of class, she failed to compile a C file using gcc and accidentally deleted its contents . Inexcusable & embarassing... | Yes, she's as bad as everyone here is writing. Sweetheart of a person and generous with grades, but the teaching is disorganized and hard to follow (both online and in person). Good luck | I read all these reviews prior to taking Strike and thought I knew what I was getting into. She is significant worse than I expected/thought was possible. She is by far the least competent Professor, or person, I have ever come across. Grading takes months (often without feedback), answer keys have errors, and she doesn't understand the material. | Striki literally built different. She can't post exams at the times she says she gonna post them. She hasnt graded anything and its been 5 weeks. It's quite baffling at how distant she is from actually knowing how to use a computer, and more ironic that she literally ""teaches"" about computers. She makes announcements in Greek. 0/10 | She purposefully makes her questions make no sense and she expects you to be able to read her mind and understand what she is actually asking. She shows up late to most of the lectures. She always goes over time by at least 10 minutes. Asks questions on quizzes that are not in the notes or book. | very disorganized, not great at lecturing, test and quizzes were very very tough. Class is not structured very well | Very nice person. She means well. But lectures and material are impossible to comprehend. Very disconnected from students. Projects involve intricate C coding when half the class has never even programmed in C. Lots of work too. Exams are long, full of typos, and it's never clear what shes asking. Heavy curve and lenient grader due to low averages. | It sucks that such an important class like CompArch is taught by her. After speaking to classmates, it's mainly those that have prior experience that do well. If you're a total noob, you will drown cause her lectures are dry/hard to follow and the material isn't widely available online. Her questions on exams and hw are super wordy and confusing. | She teaches us horribly, blames us for doing poorly on the exam and not studying enough, and assigns us the exam again for homework again after giving no feedback on it. Her exam questions make no sense and are impossible to comprehend. Can't even solve her own exam/homework problems correctly. Do NOT take Striki!! | 1) Class isn't mandatory. Show up once a week so you know what chapter she's covering. 2) Ask her what chapters will be on the quiz/exam. Then read the textbook (2) hours a week. 3) She's very nice and loves when students interact with her. 4) I put in a decent amount of work to get an A. She won't fail you if you try. 5) Don't be in a lazy group. | Expected A/B+ , earned B. Grading was strict but I liked the course. Learned a lot. Super hard projects but helpful. Agree with exams being super long but were also smart, nothing I've seen so far in ECE. Prof is quite good. She covered certain topics really deep. Slides are confusing. Must attend lecture to make sense out of these, else forget it | This is my second time taking her (Comp Arch & Comp Systems) and I learned very little for both courses. Her quizzes and final are okay if you read the book a lot. The midterm was tough and super long. Projects are a pain and homework was not bad but takes a lot of your time. She is very caring if you talk to her during her office hours. Good luck! | Worst professor in the entire ECE department. Zero common sense when it comes to logistics, and makes an already confusing subject even more confusing by not coming prepared to lecture. Exams are full of mistakes and you'll never finish them in time even if you study for weeks beforehand. However, she gives extensions on homework/projects often. | Horrible...... You won't learn anything and it's a sad thing since you paying for it. However, you won't fail this class at all since her curve is so generous that everyone passes this class. Super Long exams and around 2 quizzes. Lets put it this way if you want to pass without going to class take her, if you want to learn take it with Burdea. | Nice as a person, but horrible at grading, teaching, and having common sense. Avoid her at all cost | Great lecturer, nice lady. Her slides though are little messy. Must attend lectures to make sense out of them. Examples on forks, synchro, critical section were great. Finally figured when to use semaphores and when CVs. In CS you must study UNIX manuals completely on your own, I find ECE lectures much more effective. Exams were tough: have mercy! | Guys give the prof a break, she moved around dates cuz we requested extensions all the time. This was a savior, I got extra time to finish all assignments. HW and projects were really cool, learned a lot. And kinda liked her exams cuz many questions were like challenger puzzles which I guess made people mad but I enjoyed. Prof is very smart & nice. | The tests and quizzes are made to be hard and the course material gives little-moderate material on them. As long as you are at or slightly above the test average you will be fine. I wish this class was a little more structured. She gave us what materials to study on the final the midnight prior to the 8am final. She also surprise attendance | She's so late with grading. Very disorganized. Terrible teacher. Projects and homework are so long and even she doesn't understand the assignments. The only positive thing about her class is that it's hard to fail; she gives big curve at the end. She only fails 1 or 2 people. Sometimes, she moves deadlines. If this site let me rate her 0, I would. | Horrible horrible teacher. The worst professor in the whole ECE department. You won't learn anything at all. I wish ECE department would give more damn about our mental health. Her changing the grading criteria after the final exam lead to loosing half letter grade for me. I haven't seen any course taught with this much disorganized structure. | Ruined my computer engineering education at Rutgers. Can not function as a professor at all. Completely disorganized class with little to no structure. She can not string together a coherent sentence that is understood by her students. I could have never fathomed someone so incompetent before taking her class. Very nice and caring lady though! | Computer systems is the hardest class you will take, but yet it is taught by the worst professor in the department. Im walking out learning nothing, class is very hard, Striki is disorganized, doesnt grade anything till last minute. | Probably one of the worst professors in the department. She comes to the class unprepared, has no idea what she is teaching. She is incoherent at best and her teaching material is a jumbled piece of garbage. She had no plan for the course. She expects everyone to drop other courses and focus only on her class. | She is the worst professor in the ece department. Always unprepared for lecture, doesnt understand the material. I dont understand how she teaches 3 of the core courses for comp engineering. If you have her for compArch, OS or parallel comp then good luck you will not learn a thing. If you care about passing maintain average, she does curve. | She doesnt understand the material herself. I was clueless about the course hence I spent my Spring break study Intro to OS on Udacity, which is 90% similar to this course. Turns out she is the one who is clueless about the material. She makes simple concepts extremely complicated, sometimes she spends 30 on a slides because she doesnt it. | String theory suggests that there are infinite numbers of parallels universes. Since the amount of matter is finite in each universe, we have many universes that are similar to us with some changes. Hence, anything is possible in other universes. However, I can guarantee you that youll never find a worse professor than Striki. | Horrible, horrible, horrible teacher. I don't know how she still has her job. I'm a senior engineering student and I have never received a grade below a B and I'm currently failing her class in my last semester. GPA runnier, avoid at all cost. | she was an amazing teacher, she was like a mother to me, she helped me a lot and nurtured me whenever I needed nurturing. Her life lessons have helped me get through college and my job. She needs a raise | I have never written a review about a professor before but this had to be done. She is the WORST Professor at Rutgers, in New Jersey, in America, on this Planet, in this Galaxy, in this Universe and probably parallel universes as well. She will spend the entire lecture on one problem trying to figure it out herself then skip thru 20 slides in 1min | The worst professor I ever had in Rutgers. NOT ""one of the worst""!!! It is ""the worst"". | I can confidently say that she can not teach at all. All the material used in the class has been borrowed from other universities. Course material is pretty interesting. You can expect long exams and quizzes (which follow directly from lecture and hw) as well as group projects. I can assure you that the curve is godly, so passing is not an issue. | She is definitely the most uncoordinated and unprofessional professor in the department. Her class was all over the place and totally disorganized. On top of that she is a HORRIBLE lecturer, lets students talk for 50 minutes about a single example. If you can AVOID AT ALL COSTS. If not, then good luck. | probably one the worst professor in the department. She is a horrible lecturer because she lacks any fluidity what so ever. The homework and project she made herself was unclear and she assigned it all at the same time. She is giving the only midterm in April, and if its anything like the quiz the questions will be completely ambiguous. Avoid her | nice lady, curve was fair. The saving grace of this class was that undergrads that did at least 66% as well as grad students were guaranteed at least a C+. But she is terrible at explaining the course material and didn't seem like she understood the material herself. Projects were hard, but fair. Exams were super hard. Her lecture slides were bad."
"Jha, Shantenu","His attendance policy is trash, the class is professionalism and ethics and is 1 credit, which he fails to realize. he treats it as a 3/4 credit class. | This is for 14:332:452 Software Engineering, but it wasn't listed as an option. He seems to know his stuff, but that's all. He can't be bothered to do the most basic things, such as posting when quizzes take place and what chapters they're on. If you ask about it, he'd say he mentioned it already. There's no extensions, and his grading is strict. | This course, or the professor is just absurd. Better not pick the class because he can't teach anything useful, but he is very strict to students, not himself. The requirement and standard for this course is so unclear. Please take consideration of picking this one | The professor is good but cant teach that well, maybe he is a good research person. The course had so much work that focusing on other courses is tough. Every week there is either an exam, quiz, homework or project presentation. And if you feel that a certain week is going to be free,relax no more, it is the pop quiz week. Took it just for credits. | The class wasn't really that tough but there's a lot of work and the lectures were so long that in the end you will lose focus. The professor doesn't have teaching material of his own, everything is based on the Princeton Algorithm class. He is strict and only willing to bend the rules on his terms not on yours."
"Scott, Kimberly","DELLC Intro to Eng, not 291. Little to no clarification on assignments. Projects started meaninglessly and never followed up. ""Projects"" felt more like arts and crafts than actual engineering assignments (jewelry designing for an all-girls intro to eng class? really? it wasn't even design, it was creating charms to string onto premade necklaces). | Took 440:115(DELLC Intr. to Eng.). She does not care for this class at all. Instructions for the bajillion projects she gives us are unclear. These projects are meaningless and do not even introduce anything abt its respective engineering field, its just busy work she gives us so that the class feels like an actual class. Grades weirdly too. | Exams are very difficult due to time constraints. Errors propagate through in multi-part problems. | Did extremely well with minimal effort (zoned out in basically every class). My secret: I read the textbook, unlike almost everyone else. Prof isn't the best at lecturing anyway (moves through exs too fast, bad at answering qs, etc.), but if you go through the textbook, you'll gain a strong, fundamental understanding that will carry you through. | It is through the hw assignments in this class that I learned to fear rejection. She somehow managed to butcher the same question multiple times on a test. I sacrificed my sleep schedule for this class and it was worth it. If you want to succeed in this class then prepare to spend hours a week studying. | You go from As in HS to Ds in her class if you don't dedicate tons of time to studying and pay attention in every lecture. | I usually hate powerpoints, but she does a good job of going back and forth between using them for the concepts and doing problems in a way that you can understand. She is good about answering questions inside and outside of lecture. She is better than most professors i have had. | I am doing the energy concentration. I have a few classes I can teach, but was not sure about this one. However, i really liked the broad topics covered and her manner of doing it. There were several topics covered and despite the number of topics, Cook-Chennault does a good job of giving you a good overview. She is fair, but tough. | I have had her for two classes and she is amazing. I had her for statics and Alternative Energy Systems. She is good at explaining things and putting information in a context of how you will apply what you learn to a really job. I actually used things I learned in my internship. Exams are like the homework if you do the homework. | Best prof I had at Rutgers | She is knowledgeable and cares about her work, she speaks clearly and gives thorough answers to questions. However, if you miss an assignment for any reason do not expect much consideration even if it is not your fault. | she was actually awesome. I came to this class expecting another boring class with powerpoints and professor who does not give a sh--. uses a lot of powerpoints bu, i actually learned a lot from the class. I talked about stuff i learned from her & the class in an interview and got an internship. So what, you have to work hard - worth it | Can you say powerpoint? But, unlike some profs who do easy problems in class and test you on the hard ones - she actually does hard ones on the board so you can pass the tests. Tests are hard - multiple choice questions (no partial credit) & problem-solving ones (partial credit). She is really tough but fair in grading. | Though she uses powerpoints a lot she takes time to explain topics and really is interested in students learning. She is tough but fair. A lot of people who don't show up to class or follow instructions get mad and complain. They are idiots, really. follow instructions and go to office hours and you will do well. | Lectures consist of slides being read to the class nearly verbatim. Some classes will consist of a short, easy problem being worked over the course of an hour. Requires iclicker. Sometimes struggles to answer questions that go beyond the slides. Tests are about half multiple choice. Class does very poor job showing how cool alt energy topics can be | She's terrible. The exams were unfair and wasn't very helpful either. | Way too much homework, took between 9 and 12 hours a week to complete but did not feel useful at all because exam problems were completely different. No communication outside of lecture, does not respond to emails or show up to her own office hours. | Basically had the same experience as the two people below me. She was definitely the worst professor I've had so far. It took hours to do the homework and I felt like I understood the material. But then she goes and gives exam problems that aren't even possible? Incredibly unfair and she handled the situation terribly. | Had statically indeterminate systems on both of her midterms and never wanted to admit that she made a mistake while making them. I found her rude and unhelpful and it got progressively worse as the course went on. | Both her statics midterms featured physically impossible systems, both of which she did not address. | Dr. C is tough in terms of homework. She gives a lot, but she is available to explain and also gives examples in class. I was clueless at the beginning, but found that if I attended lecture, which can sometimes be boring (powerpoints) - I understood a lot more. She is fair in grading and tries to make things as clear as possible. | She is AWESOME! I was afraid to take her class because she is known for being a powerpoint QUEEN, BUT, she also teaches really well and is always available to answer questions. I want to take another class with her. | Kim is inspirational! I teach both Physics and Overview of Engineering to students at nearby Franklin High School. I love that she gives me and my fellow colleagues in the RURETE program the support and guidance we need to collaboratively and interactively develop hands on, inquiry based, engineering oriented, and student centered lessons. | She was a good lecturer. | Class felt poorly thought out. Topics were loosely connected, some feeling like they were put in due to being required, while everything else wasn't. | One of the best classes I ever had at Rutgers. She is good at answering questions and has definitely put a lot of time into preparing for the class. | teaches only from slides, really boring class. homework and exam problems are directly like examples done in class and in the book. overall easy class, just know how to do all example problems inside out. | A sack of potatoes has more answers than her. | Teacher is terrible. She reminds me of Palin. You ask her a question and she doesn't answer it. She made a system in our class saying we can't ask questions during class, we have to write them on an indext card and she'll address them next class. Probably because she has no idea what she is doing. | chick has no idea what she is doing- if u ask a question he has to look at her notes for ans- i wonder how she got the job - | Very good teacher, has her own method but can explain it well. | the subject matter is kinda hard, but she makes it easier to understand. she is also a real hottie."
Brown Philip,"Prof. Brown makes the class really manageable for new engineering students. The class is set up to help you succeed, should be an easy A. Projects instead of tests and homeworks every week. Need to submit something in lecture. Overall good class - recitations were helpful for learning. | the class that made me drop engineering. Don't bother with engineering at Rutgers. Professor Brown is an annoying lecturer. He made everyone buy $90 zybooks subscription just for *optional* assignments, except for the weekly attendance check. The class is easy if you have programmed but Brown won't help if you haven't. rip all of our time and money | Even online, there are synchronous recitations. Prof. Brown is a solid prof. His lectures are easy to understand, he explains concepts very well, and is easily accessible outside of class (don't email him, he'll tell you how you should get in contact with him on the syllabus). If you take lectures and recitations seriously, you'll ace the class. | I took him online during covid and he was horrible. The class was meant to be completely remote but he required we go to a mandatory synchronous recitation. He never responded to any questions (emails or on the forum). His lectures were simply voice recordings from when the class was live put over the slides that correspond. I wish I never had him. | It helps if you have any programming experience whatsoever. But without it it may be a bit of a challenge. Content of the lecture somewhat teaches you the topics, but the assignments are a very high expectation from what is taught in lecture. I did not even find online resources to be that helpful. The grading is also different and almost unfair. | Never take the online course if you are able to take it in person. The online session you don't know anything except for the information posted on slide. He never posted answers to those questions on the PPT. The only way you can communicate with him is through piazza, which usually takes him several days or even a week to respond to your question. | Professor is a snake guys be careful. Lectures are beyond boring and gives you a lot of homework only to count it as 5% and if you don't do the homework that 5% gets pushed to the weight of ex | He is boring but some information provided on the slides are very helpful to understand the beginning of Matlab. The exams were easy but the homework were long. Not bad at all | I went to lecture and just did the HW he assigned instead of paying attention. He was kind of slow in lectures and the online textbook was easier to follow conceptually and you could go at your own pace. Pop quizzes were hard, assignments and tests were relatively easy, final group project was kind of hard. Attendance matters in recitation. | Excellent lecturer, and he kept the class interesting (e.g. he did laps around the room when he taught us about loops). He was always there to help when you needed it, and especially helpful during office hours. As long as you do the work and do the practice tests, getting an A in the class shouldn't be much of a problem. Would highly recommend."
"Higgins, Kathryn","Dr. Phillips is hands down one of the best professors in the Rutgers science department. She records lectures and records extra mini lectures for difficult topics. She also has very practice-oriented review sessions. If you are taking the MCAT, this class is a must. Dr. Philips is truly everything and more; you will not regret it. | She was the best professor I had in undergrad. Go to lecture and office hours and youll do fine. The class is very fair,, and she is generous with point. just dont ask her after the class is over. | She is an amazing professor, and probably the best professor I have ever had at Rutgers. She teaches in an engaging way and posts all of her lectures and notes online so even if you miss class, you can actually make it up and still succeed. She really really cares, and has a lot of out of class reviews as well | She is the best professor at Rutgers. She was so inspirational and positive. The class is not easy but if you put the effort in, you will be rewarded. She changed the way I view look at the human body. She is brilliant too but does not talk down to you. AMAZING!!!!! | Easily the best professor that I have ever had at this school. The class is interesting and challenging. | Take this class for sure if you get the opportunity to. The material is interesting and it is a fantastic learning experience. Also, she is the absolute definition of a perfect professor. Enough said! | Everything cannot be said in 350 characters. I guess overall, I'd say I would marry her. She is genuinely the best professor I've ever had in my life, and went so beyond what I would ever expect of any educator. If you take her class, it's the only way to understand, but she's brilliant and you will not only learn SO much, but you will adore her. | She is just the best professor, ever. She makes such an effort to provide extra help on her end with review sessions (like 4 a week + OH). That being said, this class is cool but TOUGH. There is SO much information and little details that you need to know. Do not skip one day studying. Test questions are fair, but the amount of content is rough. | She is the best professor I've had in my college career. She is simply Phenomenal and I wish she taught more courses because I would take her in a heartbeat! | 100% positively the greatest lecturer I've ever had. Her sheer passion for teaching and attitude towards educating is inspirational. The class is difficult, but she provides every resource you could ask for to pass. I would happily have her teach every course I take for the rest of my life and NEVER get tired of her. Truly a gem. | She is the most amazing professor I've ever had at Rutgers for an upper-level science and for any class in general! She is so passionate for teaching and puts in soon many office hours just to make sure that every student understands the difficult material. She's also hilarious and the sweetest professor ever. Best class :) | She is my favorite professor of all time. A little challenging, but I learned so much during this semester! She made Systems one of my favorite classes of all time, because she made the material interesting and bearable when it was difficult. She posts recordings on Sakai, which are a godsend. However, there is no curve so be careful! | 2 mid terms & 1 final, each weighted 33.3% of the total grade. I spent like 23 days before exams and just read over notes. She gives out a lot of information that's not written in her notes during lectures, but she posts recordings, so you will be able to study by yourself. But, there seems to be no curve so be careful. | After being at this school, I've grown to detest the science department, but Professor Phillips really made systems enjoyable and I thoroughly had a great time! She genuinely wants you to do well on the exams (which are straightforward and fair, some questions require a lot of thinking, but overall, fair). Take her! You won't regret it! | Having spent three years at Rutgers and taken over 90 credits, Dr. Phillips is the best professor I ever had at Rutgers. She sincerely cares for all of her students and will always go out of her way to make sure every student is taken care of and that every part of her lecture is properly conveyed. I'd love to take another class with her. 10/10 | As a senior CBN major, Dr. Phillips is the best professor I had at RU. Took Sys Phys even after hearing the terrible things about it, but Dr. Phillips is truly brilliant, records her lectures, and really strives to make students understand. If she felt she didn't do well enough in lectures, she'll record home videos to re-explain. Seriously a 10/10"
"Cuitino, Alberto","PLEASE CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING FLIPPED CLASSROOM LEARNING | I attended to every lecture and I actually never met him. The class is easy if you practice a lot from the homework and from the textbook. They have a policy that if you do bad on the first midterm and do good on the second one, they will curve your first midterm. The final is not hard and there's a project that counts as homework grade. TA are key | The statics professors go over easy problems in lecture. It's on you to do practice harder problems. Exams are more complex than the homework problems. Do the extra practice problems and go to recitation. | He doesn't even lecture all the classes; he is supported by 3 other lecturers and 5 TAs. The lecture is very basic and doesn't even match the difficulty of the HW or exams. Reading the book and doing the homework is the only way you will learn anything and everything for the exams. | They spend 30 minutes explaining a concept I can explain in 3. Little to no examples. Unnecessarily complicated and boring explanations. Exams were fair. Final was a joke. It's just that if you found Statics boring like I did, you'll want to beat yourself over the head with a brick in this one, esp. with these professors. The material is VERY dry. | Interesting class. The material he teaches in class is often beyond the scope of what is tested, so most of the practical material ends up being self taught. Exams are easy but very heavily weighted (35% midterm, 55% final). The class average was low because most students didn't put in enough work, so there was an extremely generous curve. | The material you need to know for the class is much more difficult than anything he teaches. Most of the learning is done from the textbook and from other online resources. Most of the classes are taught by Professor Bereket Yohannes, who is a decent lecturer. Also, the Truss Me! competition was a lot of fun. | Really excellent professor. However, he does not teach all the lectures. Dr. Yohannes taught many lectures and he is an awful professor. Be wary. | You basically end up teaching yourself the material. The lectures for this class were absolutely useless. Highly recommend using the internet as a resource to learn how to do the problems for this class. | He's the main professor but rarely shows up to class. Wasn't that good at teaching and I get the feeling that he was just concentrated on his research. Some of the professors that sub in for him are good though. BEST TIP: Watch the video solutions in the study area of mastering engineering. | Cuitino was my dudeeeee. Good teacher and hooked it up on partial credit. Got a B in this class, worked hard for it but not as much as I do in Dynamics | When he rarely showed up, it wasn't even good teaching. I get the impression that he doesn't want to teach a freshmen class and that he couldn't care less, especially when he walked in 15-20 mins late every day he taught and came in wearing gym clothes. It's good that Prof.Higgins came in every other week to recover from his poor week of teaching. | Lectures can get pretty boring. Do the homework problems, and you're pretty much prepared for the tests. Go over extra problems in the textbook if you need extra practice. I pretty much skipped every other lecture and almost every recitation. Taught most of it to myself and got an A. | he isnt bad, his lectures drag on for a while and he overexplains almost everything which is helpful at times but half the time puts people to sleep. I got the text book and so far Ive opened it about two times. the homework is a mix of ""so easy a seven year old should know this"" and ""is this even in the chapter"" and ""WTF is this?!"" | Really good. Used homework problems on exams and used problems similar to ones he did in lecture on final, which was really easy. I withdrew with Pae and got a B+ with Cuitino. | If at all possible, take Cuitino instead of Pae. DO NOT TAKE PAE. | Funny and much more interesting than Norris, just as easy. Gives alternate methods of solution in class too, if you can't learn by the book's methods. | Yeah he's among the few good professors for Statics. If you have him, he will make everything very easy for you. Just do the HW and the examples in class and you'll do fine on the exams. | Cuitino is great in intro to materials and other classes. To all the freshmen who don't like him for statics, he is easier and clearer than most other professors out there in engineering. If you don't understand something then go to office hours and actually do all the homework. | Cuitino is a good professor. He also has a sense of humor. If you are smart, you can get a lot from him, because he knows a lot. If you are not smart, you will not do homework and you will not do well, because he is demanding. | He doesn't do any examples at all. Homework is ridculous. He expects you to derive things in the exams. | First problem: He can't lecture for anything. Lectures mostly on theory and does examples that are nothing like the homework or exam. Second problem: Homework is ridiculous. Third problem: This guy just doesn't give a d@mn. Leaves too much stuff to his evil TAs. | not bad"
"Lynch, Jennifer","Dr. Bryan may seem like a strict teacher, but she just wants students to succeed! She is always willing to answer questions and help where she can, but she will challenge you to make sure you are pushing work that is not lackluster. | Rude in emails/online, submitted almost no grades during the semester, 'my way or the highway' type of attitude even if you were actively asking her for help, and was not clear in her advice. some peeps comments on draft 3 were given less than a week before it was due. So much random work during the semester, Take someone else please | DO NOT take for creative writing. The course is one of the easiest classes you can take for core and she ruined that. Blog posts and readings due every class, projects that she does not give clear directions for and then gives you a B just because she did not like how you did it. Plus she makes you buy a textbook. | Dr. Bryan is super nice, understanding, and helpful. She was approachable, gave good feedback, and had a clear grading rubric. Expos is a hard class with lots of reading, analysis, and writing, but taking it with Dr. Bryan will definitely help you improve your writing (I got a C on my first essay and an A on my last one). Take her class!!! | She was really cool and actually taught the course well even though it was an annoying one to take. She was pretty helpful, overall Dr Bryan was really cool | I LOVE PROFESSOR BRYAN IN EXPOS 101!!! I learned so much on how to improve my writing during this course. Although attendance is mandatory she gives lots of 'days off' to finish up assignments that are due soon. 100% recommend, she is my favorite prof that I've had at RU so far. | Her grading was unfair and she would nitpick at everything. She wouldn't show up to her own writing office hours, never let me schedule meetings outside hours, and her emails were unhelpful. She also gave back last draft comments 3 days before the final paper was due after saying she would give them back a week in advance. Worst teacher I've had. | Professor Bryan was one of my favorite writing professors I have ever had. She gave great feedback on what I have worked on. The HW revolves around a blog post each week of the semester, with a few quizzes and discussion posts mixed in. You will also need to do a 10 min podcast, video project, and moving slideshow of sorts. The work is doable. | There was a lot of assignments, but it was mostly busy work, not necessarily that hard. Also, make sure you do the readings because she sometimes gives out pop quizzes on the reading if no one participates in the discussions. Other than that, she's really nice and was very responsive to any of the questions I had about the assignments. | She literally just throws assignments at you without teaching you how to do anything. If you know nothing about blogging/podcasting DON'T take this class. She says multiple times ""this is not a technology class, figure that out on your own"" even if you have no idea what you're doing. Doesn't teach you anything, expects you to know everything. | She's always extending due dates and is very understanding. Once you get to the research essay part it's a chill class. Easy grader too. Just do the work well and you'll get an A | Dr. Bryan is a gem who should be respected, and revered for the brilliant person and professor that she is. The documenting your world class provides students with a lot of creative freedom. You will learn a lot the different forms of creative writing in media today if you didn't already. Show that you are trying and that's all that matters. | Dr. Bryan is a great professor to have for Expos. She is great at involving students in discussions and really helps students to understand the material. She is not an easy grader, and you will have to work a lot for an A. | Dr Bryan is the ultimate expos professor. She has clear grading criteria, she gives out a circled rubric every time. She is focuses on student learning. Expos is a boring class to take but she comes up with different methods of learning every time. The best thing about her is she isn't stingy at handing out A,she will give it to tho who deserves it"
"Zhang, Yuqian","Prof Zhang cares about students and listens to suggestions. His exams are not straightforward, as he wants you to sort out the problems with taught concepts. Homework problems are very helpful though. Also his grades are generous. Like two thirds of the class got A with a low cutoff (lower 70s). | Bad Professor. Grades only made of tests and curve isn't even a curve-simply cutoffs for grades. Offers regrade requests for answers different from key but does not acknowledge them and says, ""look at the answer key it is not the same."" Also, very destructured class where content learned doesn't reflect the content tested on. Would not recommend. | this class is only graded on the midterms and finals, no extra assignments to boost your grade. there is no ""curve"" in the sense that your grade gets boosted up, but there is a cutoff. he's a kind and caring professor, but i did not learn in lecture and had to teach myself everything. | Prof. Zhang is a really chill dude who genuinely cares about his students. Although he does have an accent which does make it hard to understand him at times, he is happy to explain concepts again. Fall 2023 was the first time he taught ChemH315 and he did a great job. He was nervous about teaching us but he did good. For this course, READ THE BOOK | Professor Zhang is a pretty chill professor. While there were a few hiccups here and there in the course, he made sure everyone did well in his class. Definitely pay attention to his lectures and drill down the homeworks, as they mostly imitate the exams. He made the curve extremely generous for the class too. | Prof. Jason is amazing. This guy is one of the nicest you would ever meet. It's his first time teaching 315 but he did it very well. Very knowledgeable and caring. He offered office hours from 7 pm to 12 am before the final, this is how dedicated he is. His exams are based on lectures and homework. It's not a hard class but definitely needs work. | orgo is a difficult class, as to be expected, but he just spent all of his time just lecturing us. I wished that there was some sort of practice problems that he put on his slides that I could go back too (his slides are not very helpful unless you took notes in class). IMO recitation is really where you will learn the material, you should go!!! | I wish he provided more practice in class instead of just explaining the concepts as orgo needs practice. If you attend recitation/tutoring though you will be fine. No matter who you take orgo with it is going to be hard and there is a lot of self-studying. The grade is based on 3 midterms and a cumulative final. Professor is fine but course sucks. | Dont do it, i stopped going to class and when to tutoring every day after the first exam. granted i was behind on material the lectures are absolutely pointless to go to. My TA for recitation sucked too. Trying again next semster | Shocked by the positive reviews. I am a pre-med with a 3.9 GPA. I haven't received a grade lower than a B+. I study A LOT. I can only decipher MAYBE 20% of the lecture due to his extremely heavy accent. He's nice, sure, who cares? That isn't going to teach you the material. Also doesn't give homework, which is a must to practice. Take someone else! | Great professor. Really cares about his students | Prof Zhang is very knowledgeable in the field. He listens to every suggestion and critique that students have to bring. He uploads videos where he goes over the entire chapter and the exams as well. Go in this class with an open mind and be prepared to do a lot of practice problems and studying. One of the best chem profs in the department. | Professor Zhang is a very knowledgeable man. The slides he posts are decent and the textbook contain many problems that you should be doing daily. Also, erase all preemptive ideas you have of organic chemistry as a whole. This class could be stressful but walking in with the right attitude makes a huge difference. Practice doing problems online too | Absolutely stellar professor, made learning organic chemistry manageable and is one of the few Rutgers professors that truly took student feedback into consideration/cared about students. More importantly, he ensured grades/tests were as fair and balanced as they could be. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable about the subject; it showed. | This class is so difficult but Zhang just genuinely cares so much about his students and really wanted to see us succeed in this course. You're still going to have to study a bunch and the textbook is a really good resource but honestly Zhang motivated us so much. | Professor Zhang is hands down one of the best orgo307 professors. He really cares. You still have to study your butt off for the exams. But he uploads videos on the exam to explain everything. His powerpoints are also super helpful. He also has his office hours as a facebook page, which at first I didn't like but it's useful when studying for final | The class is difficult, don't get me wrong, but professor Zhang is really clear about what things will show up on the midterm. He has an accent but he explains things really well. His exams aren't too difficult if you do all the problems in the textbook. For the practice he assigns, he gives video explanations of the answers. Best prof in orgo307 | As dreadful as this course is, I think that Professor Zhang really tries his best to teach this course. He tries to compare a lot of the concepts by using analogies to help us. However, the course is only based off of 3 midterms, and your final is 50% of your grade. It is a hard course, so I would suggest getting the textbook to learn most. | This class is overall ridiculous and requires hours and hours of studying, but this is Jasons first semester teaching and he did a pretty good job. He isnt a very good teacher, but he definitely makes an effort to try to address the problems that students have. His lecture slides are very useful in studying for exams. | This was Professor Zhangs first time teaching Orgo I. He cared significantly more than the other 2 professors and tried to be as upfront with the students about exam material as he could. Lecture notes are also the best of the 3 professors. He even held more office hours right before the final until late because he knew students had questions. | This was Professor (Jason) Zhang's first semester teacher Orgo307. He was the only one of the three professors who actually seemed to care about his students. He tried to teach organic chemistry in a way that made sense and was very open about what would be on exams. This course is extremely difficult and graded/structured ridiculously."
"Pham, Hoang","He takes 99% of his quiz/test questions from exercises in lecture, so go to class and take good notes and it's straightforward. The group projects are intense but he seemed to grade more on effort than result accuracy. He has a heavy accent and can be hard to understand but cares a lot and is definitely willing to help you out if you need anything."
"Gursoy, Melike","Good Professor, very smart and know what she's doing. Not the clearest when it comes to organizing ideas in the board, what forces you to be on 'fully aware' mode the whole class. The semester is stressful, but you will realize you learned a lot when it's over. She also cares for her students and is very accessible outside of class. | Most irresponsible lecturer I've ever seen in my student life. She's smart for sure, but it doesn't mean she can do everything freely. She'd ask students to take final exam again even 2 months after official final date and deliver score another month after. | The course is hard for sure, but Gursoy is defiantly a good teacher. | worst professor I ever had. Lady is very smart but as a teacher she does not do a good job. Lectures are not clear and she makes the topics more complicated than they really are. Gives a ton of exercises for homework and only grades one. She doesn't develop exercises during the lectures. I regret so much taking this class. | She's really smart and know the subject. This can be good, because she always teaches further than most professors would, but sometimes she assumes students have a bigger previous knowledge than they truly have. She is very helpful if you go to her office hours. | DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!! If you have her, just drop it or switch sections. She is really boring at lecturing and unfair in gradings. Took the finals, which is second midterm for her; I studied 3 days straight and got an really low grade. That's not it! I am taking her optional final which is conflict with my 3 other finals, she wont let me change it! | Worse professor ever! The 1st and second exam wasn't bad some of the problems came from the book. The final was horrible. She's forgets about having an appointment with her students at times. | Dr. Gursoy is really nice. her lectures are actually not that hard to follow if you pay attention. It would spend more time associating the equations to real life examples. The first exam isn't hard | She is by far the worst professor I have ever had, a complete disgrace to the IE department at Rutgers. Teachers like her are why tenure should not exist. | Extremely nice professor, go to office hours and ask a lot of questions. Exams are very tough but grading is very skewed, so it's not impossible | Tough, not impossible. Does not expect anything unreasonable from students. | man.. she has got to go..imagine a class full of phd students gaping at the board dumb founded.. she manages to erase every trace of previous knowledge u had in the subject. her exams are really tough, and her teaching style is atrocious. | From her previous research work, it is clear that she is smart and intelligent. But her teaching is a total failure. Few students was able to follow her misleading instruction, even if they have previous probabilistic knowledge background. | It's 5:32 A.M. and the fact that I've been in the freakin comp lab staring at a 2000 line LP for the last 72 hours is testament enough to this wom insanity. SOOOOO WHOOO is going to TEELLLLL MEEEEE when this nut-bag is going to lose her damn profesorship | If I'm paying 15K to go to school, I expect educators not lecturers. You need to teach in several different ways so everyone has an opportunity to understand.PHD, doesn't mean I can teach. Harder the material, the better of a teacher is needed!!!!!!!!! | This is a tough little lady. No one questions her intellect, but for god's sakes her exams are freakin impossible. She also spends 99% of her class time writing notes on the board & lacks organizational skills, ex: visit the warzone she calls an office. | Can't teach her way out of a paper bag. Thinks everyone is a PhD in her kind of math and doesn't vare if anyone understands the material. She seems to get a****erse pleasure from tormenting her students. | No Comments | The material could be taught so much easier, but she insists on making every class the ultimate challenge. She really has to stop teaching"
"Ghofrani, Ali","Very easy professor again. Prior knowledge is of python is not necessary. He will teach you everything needed. A lot of homework but that helps with your grade. Up to 3 projects too. A lot of students are grads and they work, so he's okay with a flexible schedule. | Very easy professor. Prior knowledge is not necessary. A lot of homeworks but that helps with your grade. Up to 3 projects too. A lof of students are grads and they work, so he's okay with a flexible schedule."
"Mann, Adrian","I'm sure he is a knowledgeable man, but is an incredibly boring professor. I found myself falling asleep every class. He doesn't explain topics well and his slides are usually unhelpful. His assignments were very time consuming and difficult. | This class was interesting but annoying. Mann is condescending an rolls his eyes when people ask or answer question. | Good professor, the lectures were concise and educational, and his class was interesting. Definitely really passionate about his field. I took this for a requirement but I'm glad I did. I just wish he was more flexible with his assignments, he'll provide no quarter if you're late."
"Norris, Andrew","Has lectures which are not technically mandatory but will occasionally give an in class quiz. Lectures are very dry and somewhat difficult to understand at times. The material is easy enough to self study. | Professor Norris made an already tedious and boring subject worse. His lectures were a long monotone drone, with examples shown in the worst ways possible. I had to self-teach everything, and only attended class to take potential quizzes. | Only reason I didn't give him a 1 is because he sometimes helps students out. His lectures are boring, slow, & unnecessary. I'd compare him to the sloth in Zootopia. He slowly reads powerpoints in lecture while students struggle to stay awake. He introduced lecture quizzes making it mandatory to attend, as you never know when you will have a quiz. | Very dry lectures, he stopped using slides halfway through the semester so you had to rely on handwritten notes and the textbook. Exams were rarely like the example problems and homework. If you have the choice to take a class with a different professor, I'd recommend that. | Professor Norris was ok overall. It took him a long time to grade our papers and was probably way too easy on everyone. Showed a lot of videos in class. Not bad, but not my style. | Boring Guy, doesn't teach well since he only reads from powerpoints. The first exam is hard but then he makes the second exam easy enough for you to get a good grade or at least a passing one. However, he makes the final hard. There's a project. He curves | Norris is a good guy. He actually uses Sakai like it's supposed to be used. In his sakai is his own set of notes which are thorough and clear. Towards the end of the semester I skipped class for almost 4 weeks straight (excluding quizzes). I still got a B+ and learned a lot just by doing homework and looking at his excellent notes. Final was fair. | Had him for statics, his lectures aren't that engaging, as he talks quietly and just goes over slides which are posted online, but he doesn't take attendance. His tests are similar to the assigned hw and are graded fairly. He does offer an extra credit assignment and is responsive to students needs as are his TA's. | He doesnt seem to care about his students and it shows when he doesnt try to make practice exams for us. He teaches as if we know the material already but noone understands anything from lecture (Still attend though). His exams are not the worst, its just that he doesnt care. | Professor Norris knows his stuff and is a very nice man. Would definitely help anyone who asks for assistance and I would recommend him to anyone. He makes some errors in class. There are 6 unannounced quizzes in lecture or recitation so you kinda have to go to class. If you sit in the front it's very easy to pay attention. | While he's not incompetent or inept like others here have said, but he's not really that spectacular. He does go over problems and you don't really have to do the homework to do alright. He is caring for the students though; he once managed to stop nearby construction due to a ceiling tile falling on a student. | He can't really teach well and he is really boring but he knows what he is talking about. Kind of spacey when he teaches? He is a very nice guy. His office hours are very helpful where he will do the hw with you. He is very laid back and approachable for the most part. | Pretty Good Professor. Goes over a lot of problems in class. Test and quizzes are relavent to the homework. So do and go over the homework and you'll do fine in the class. | Very easy class. Norris is boring, but is willing to help (even via email, and in good detail, which is helpful if you tend to skip class only to find the homework difficult later). If you can get past the monotony of the class, he isn't all that bad. | interesting lecturer covers a lot of material and answers questions | excellent professor, generous curve, and lectures that are relevant to the quizzes | interesting lecturer goes fast but answers questions | hes so lame. has to be the dullest professor at rutgers. you dont need ADD to fall asleep in his class. he also cant teach for****. | He is unbelievably boring. His tests are straight from the homework so all you have to do is just look over those. He is a bad teacher though, we had an assistant take his place for two classes and the assistant was awesome, i think i cried when we got Norris back. | lame class with no purpose. you have to teach yourself but theres is not reference to help you out. | He mumbles in the lectures, so it is impossible to hear what he is saying. Most people don't even go to the lectures. His teaching methods will probably do more to confuse than clarify. I recommend using the textbook and a friend to learn in this class."
"Shan, Jerry","Great professor with enjoyable lectures. The schematic for this class is very lab-heavy. A majority of your grade comes from lab and I just did not do well on the first two labs but overall, concepts are very understandable through Professor's lectures. | Good professor, but homework could overly difficult at times. The material covered in lecture in some cases was not presented well enough and this made homework much harder to do. Exams were fair, and where and how you lost points on the exam was clear. The lab part of the class was more tedious and long rather than hard. Grades could take a while. | Lectures were great and he made the material interesting to learn about; he derived every equation and explained why we used those equations. Probably the best professor I have had; only complaint is that it took quite a while to receive grades back. | Hands down the best lecturer I have ever had. He takes the time to hand derive every equation you use and explain every part of those equations. He explains every example he does by hand so each step makes sense. The only complaint I have is how dependent your grade is on exams and that for f2021, assignments took months to grade. | Dr. Shan really cares about his students and his attention to detail in preparing his lesson plans really shows. | Teaches well and explains the concepts in an easy-to-understand way. Weekly HW due in class. His lecture notes are great, which he writes out on the board. Exams are tough. 1 Page of short answers, and 2 longer problems. His short are either definitiontheory or small problems. and come from Notes. Main Problems are like examplesHW with a twist. | An excellent professor. He teaches material in a clear and organized manner. He does his best to make a decently boring subject exciting. He gives straightforward exams and grades very fairly. I would recommend taking him for any MAE class. | Jerry Shan the Asian man, he does physics whenever he can. I love Jerry Shan. | Shan is a very good, systematic and entertaining lecturer. Not only is he a very good teacher but also an excellent researcher. Take his class. Not that hard on students if you work well and attend all the classes. | I had Jerry Shan for both MAE312 (Fluid Dynamics) and MAE350 (Mechanical Measurements) and he is by far my favorite professor I've had from the engineering department. He is extremely helpful, very nice, and teaches in such a way that if you pay attention in class and study what he gives you, you'll always do well. HWs are graded & difficult tho. | Although Fluid Mechanics is a Hard class he manages to teach it quite well and is always helpful and responsive to your questions. If you have any trouble with the HW, there's usually a group who does it with him during office hours! Overall GREAT professor, probably the only one at Rutgers who's actually cared about his students... | Really a nice guy who likes to teach students and help them. Absolutely loved his notes.. If you are taking him, just follow his notes and try to do the HW (if you cant do it). ALSO, ATTEND THE CLASS because short answer in the exams are always repeated in the lectures... ENJOY the class and love Fluid mechanics...:) | lectures ARE NOT relevant to the hw AVOID THIS TROLL | this guy sucks | Good. | He is very clear when he teaches. Just go to lecture and you will do fine. His exams are pretty straightforward as well. 1/3 of it is all short answer problems that any student who went to class will do well on. The other 2/3 are split up nicely, but generally harder. | I have not seen anybody more systematic, clear and more knowledgeable. If you take his class, just take his notes and you don't even need to look into the textbook. His notes and homeworks are just enough to do good in the class.. Makes you love the subject. Take him if you can.. | Shan is the man for fluid...you pple should definitely take him. He gives very good notes...overall he is the great teacher. | Had Shan for fluids. Real nice guy, material is tough though. Does a good job lecturing, but exams are pretty tough (1 cheat sheet permitted on all exams)."
"Drazer, German","Very difficult class but the lectures from professor were not as bad as people are saying. He introduces the basic concepts but self-studying is definitely required. Willing to work with you in office hours and answers questions clearly. 3 Midterms and 1 final with weekly graded homework. | Fluids is a notoriously difficult class anywhere, not just Rutgers. Lectures are heavily theory based but exams were fair. 3 midterms and a final. Had to do a bunch of self studying but Drazer uploads his COVID lectures which were helpful. Very nice guy when you talk to him and willing to work with you with grades in reason. | Professor Drazer made fluids interesting! I thoroughly enjoyed his chalkboard lectures, which he puts great work into, as his derivations make fluids intuitive and beautiful. He is very patient with students, answering questions clearly and thoroughly. He has a great sense of humor and is very approachable in class and during office hours. | Drazer is a great lecturer; he spends a decent amount of time on derivations, but also spends the time working through full textbook examples (which are often very similar to what he tests on exams!). The class is very manageable so long as you kept up with the HW and understood the examples in class. He's also quite funny during lectures. | Drazer is the best! He's hilarious, and made morning lectures worth going to. Fluids is chill, HW is not bad, the exams are not hard(possible to get more than 100%). Drazer spends many lectures deriving equations, but he also does examples. He teaches in great depth. Drazer convinced me that fluids is beautiful and made me curious to learn more. | I thoroughly enjoyed Fluids with Prof. Drazer! Class was at 8:30 this semester, but he is a fun lecturer that made the class content very digestible. Often times, Drazer would spend an entire class working through one example, but doing so extremely slowly and meticulously so that the concepts stuck. He loves answering questions from students too. | Terrible professor and not accommodating at all. Every student gets below a 50 and somehow it still is an A. You would think he would change the way he grades or teaches since clearly students are not learning anything. 1.9/5 is generous for him. | Epitome of you mediocre engineering professors. You can replace attending his lectures with previous years online lectures + textbook, but the material is hard and the second midterm average (46%) reflects that. Doesn't seem to care much about students; had a homework due the day AFTER our final until people complained enough to make it optional. | When u have a professor who weights a final as 45% of ur grade, u know u r in for a fun ride. Terrible lectures, harsh grader & takes forever to return grades. If u can avoid him for fluids u should. Fluids is already a hard class & its even harder w/ him. Hes overly obsessed with long math derivations which only confuses things more. Funny guy tho | His lectures were very clear and exams very straightforward. The homework he assigns prepares you for exams and there are no surprises. I really liked that his lecture went more in depth than and sometimes even beyond the textbook so that going to class was actually worth my time. Overall a reasonable and sympathetic professor. | The dude is garbage. It felt he rarely was prepared to actually teach; like he knew how to do most of the stuff but absolutely could not show anyone else how. The content of the course isn't THAT hard but it has no flow to it and as I said, he's bad at explaining, plus the book sucks. He will make fun of people though so at least you get to laugh | Does not give any resources to students. No lecture slides, homework solutions, etc are put online. Exams are impossible. Structured so you are forced to work on a single question for a given time and is then collected after time is up. No going back to check your work. Grading is partially done by TA's who are generally nice. Avoid if possible. | very accent. Hard grader with no partial credit. | Doesn't teach the class very well. He doesn't prepare you for what's on the exams. | He was a terrible teacher. Doesn't give any partial credit on exams is right or wrong. He gives you back your test a month later. Not helpful on tell you what is going to be in the exams either | A lot of people weren't happy with his teaching because 1) He has an accent 2) He is very mathy 3)He expects you to know a certain amount going in. These things considered, though, his lectures covered all of the material (he derives things too) and the exams are straight forward. You will need the book if you want to get a physical understanding | Terrible teacher. Hard grader. I didn't learn a thing from him. he is the worst teacher in the ME department. If you have him drop it and take it next semester. | Really bad professor. Can't teach at all, and the exams are really hard. Takes forever to hand back exams, and he's a hard grader. I don't feel like i learned anything in his class, and I studied."
"Malhotra, Rajiv","doesn't care about teaching but the class is easy to pass | He doesnt care about teaching the class and has no interest. Given a semester long project that is 90% of ur grade. Basically learn how to use COMSOL on ur own thru completing step by step tutorials. Hes generous in grading so u can get a good grade as long as u put in effort. MAE439 is a terrible class regardless of professor, waste of time BS | I don't know how this class used to be, but that was bad. One semester-long project with randomly assigned group members. The grade was based on presentations, all the homework was just comsol tutorials. Only a few videos of ""Lecture"". | Does not teach. Completely inaccessible | Very clear lectures and very understanding. If you do the optional homework and pay attention in lecture, you'll be in good shape for the exams. The grade cutoffs were strange, so you'll have to work hard for an A. | Overall solid prof. Transition to online was a little rough but it was alright. I not a huge fan of the project, and it isn't super clear what is wanted. | Puts questions on exams that are either on homeworks or gone over in lectures exactly resulting in inflated grades and a ridiculous downcurve. I guess he tried to make it easier on the class because of the virus, but it just ended up hurting us. | He is the definition of a Goat. If he is available take him!! | That curve made me fall outta my chair"
"Diez Garias, Francisco","Horrible professor IMO. Had 3-4 homeworks, 2 quizzes and a midterm and final. Midterm he made 2 questions the exact same as the practice problems so kids just got away with printing solutions. Final was more challenging. Not a bad guy just not reliable at all, will change midterm dates, etc. last minute and overall just didnt explain anything well | Diez has good dry humor and stories to put some fun into an otherwise pretty one-dimensional class. Online Wiley HW, quizzes (sometimes for extra credit). Midterm and final, 40% each. Kept moving midterm date, but told us almost all the problems that were on it. Him and TA are generous graders. Overall, a fine class I generally had no issue with. | I've never had a professor who sucked at their job so badly that the exam averages are consistently in the 40s every year. He seriously thought that our class collectively agreed to do poorly on the midterm exam on purpose... no dude you just don't know how to teach. Diez either needs to do better or be let go by the department. | One of the worst professors I've taken. Changes the grading scheme throughout the semester based on how he's feeling. Assumes we know everything, and teaches like he is smarter than everyone in the room. The quizzes are similar to the hw, so focus on those. The final was a curveball with only one problem similar to the midterm. Lowest quiz dropped. | The worst professor I've ever had. Period. If you could avoid him, do so at all costs. Grades arbitrarily, depending on how he's feeling that day. The teaching style is essentially ""I know everything and I'm gonna teach you like you know everything"". Don't bother showing up for office hours. Can't ask him anything without being insulted for asking. | Least engaging engineering course taken so far. Not the best of teachers. Grades like there is no tomorrow. | U choose your own grade distributions(quizzes midterms and final), but this seems like it sets us up for our own doom. He gave no partial credit on one of the final exam problems. While this goes for everyone, it is not fair to those who chose the final exam to be 50% of grade. Nice guy, but a 85 for an A is ridiculous. Ruined my 4.0 Eng. GPA. | The final was really hard, but the quizzes were straight from the book so you start off with a high grade going in. Probably why the final was so hard. really funny, SUPER NICE =). He gives bonus for going to class sometimes too. | Diez is really nice and willing to help, but lecture is straight out of the book."
"Mayer, Valerie","She is a great teacher who engages students through class discussions showing she is very passionate and clearly cares for them. You have to work very hard on papers, but she is very helpful during office hours and really nice lady. You will definitely be prepared for expos if you take basic comp with her. | best prof you can get at Rutgers, take her course you will get better in Expo | Professor Tasiran is laid back and shes very understanding. As for her grading I would say that its pretty fair. Its kind of impossible to get an A in the class and she said it herself because that will mean that you should be in expository writing and not in basic composition. She's a professor for both classes but I only had her for basic comp. | Shes amazing. Ive been writing my whole life but I was forced into expos as a transfer. I was expecting it to be boring, but she made it interesting and I learned a lot. Shes patient and kind and extremely inspirational. I adored her class even if I was forced into it. | She's a great teacher, gives great lecture. But you will have to prepare well for the quiz if you want to get a 90-ish on the quiz. Also, she's a picky reader, make sure to really invest in your essays before submitting. | She's amazing. In each class she lectures on how to improve your writing and if you take into consideration all her feedback and read the text you can see improvement in your papers. | Really nice and awesome as a person, but when it comes to teaching, she is not really specific with what she wants, more so of a generic professor. I recommend taking this course with someone else."
"Vazquez, Maribel","Grad student that is very interested in her field. Material is presented in a clear and organized manner, very good with managing time and answering all our questions. Grade is made out of 2 exams, assignments, a paper (individual) and its presentation (with a group), and attendance. Comes off as stern but you learn she is just a student like us."
"Robbins, Jason","Prof Lewis was a really good teacher for this class. Admittedly he doesn't make it easy at all (aka quizzes were sometimes near impossible), but he will pass you regardless if he thinks you put in the work. Since it was a small class, he took a lot of time to answer questions and address concerns which helped me out a lot. | Funny professor and enthusiastic about the material. However, class is all about memorizing. He has a lot of slides on his lectures that are pictures, so definitely take notes on the specific topic for everything and you would do good. Have to go to lecture!! I didn't buy the book and I was fine. | Faunal Analysis. Man, this was a TOUGH course. Jason Lewis however made the course easier to digest by communicating science in a fun way and providing us with assistants / lab access. He gave us the tools to win which allowed many of us to stick through it all. He rocks. PS, this course needs to be 6 credits, not 3, but that is a RU issue. | I took Prof Lewis because the class seemed interesting and the his reviews were phenomenal. But! the class itself has to be the most difficult class I've taken so far. There is a lot of memorization for material (I feel) is not super fun to be memorizing. The exams are super difficult (and he knows it) so he gives a bunch of extra credit. | Jason Lewis is witty and charming and has extensive knowledge of the material he teaches. His experience as an archaeologist working with Richard Leaky allows Professor Lewis to garnish his lectures with interesting anecdotes. With so much experience, professor Lewis expects a lot from his students. Overall an extremely interesting course. | Excellent professor. Very knowledgeable. Funny! Very helpful with any questions and accomodating with extra help during office hours to get you caught up if you miss a class. Attendence is mandatory though if you want to do well on weekly practicals. I would definitely take a class he teaches again. | Great professor, very engaging in class and makes the material even more interesting! Posts slides so you can follow along easily but you still need to attend lecture. Really knows his stuff and as said before, he's very funny! Also, Sarah is a wonderful TA and is very helpful and nice. Previous comment about her couldn't be more wrong! | He says the funniest things ever. Indeed, he's like a young Jared Diamond. | Very knowledgeable and is very passionate about his research. Young and energetic. Makes the topic interesting. Very entertaining and funny. Had a TERRIBLE ta currently. Sarah H is the worst anthro at ru. Hates her job and the students. very rude. | Faunal Analysis. Difficult course, but Dr. Lewis knew the material and did a good job teaching. | can't get a better professor | Nice guy, cracks jokes a lot. Exams are easy if you study and he gives out a lot of extra credit."
"Dignon, Gregory","Professor Dignon is a great professor! His lectures are straightforward and easy to follow. He truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Whenever I had trouble with the hw or a concept during lecture, Professor Dignon welcomed me into his office. You'll definitely not regret having him as a professor."
"Liu, Meiyin","Horrible professor, should not be teaching by any means. She has absolutely no work experience hence should not be teaching construction management. Just cause someone has a pHD, should not be the reason one should be teaching construction management. Waste of money, worst professor. Pick someone who has a more reputable background and experience. | She is trying though. Tries to make it simple for students | Don't do it. Grading is super harsh for exams and homework, reads directly off the lecture slides and barely seems to know what she's teaching. You won't learn anything and exams have nothing conceptual on them. Don't waste your time or money."
"Liu, Xiang","Horrible professor, should not be teaching by any means. She has absolutely no work experience hence should not be teaching construction management.

Don't waste your time or money."
"Haghani, Sasan","This professor is really great during lectures. As someone who can have a tough time staying focused even at the front row, he has great pacing and is excellent at answering questions during lecture as well as office hours. If you spend the time understanding the homework he assigns, the quizzes and midterms are very doable and extremely fair. | Incredible lecturer. Goes over the concepts a bit quickly but does so many examples that you feel very prepared. Quizzes are tougher than exams; exams are very fair, similar to the example problems in lecture and generic homework problems. If you want to do well in this class make sure to go to lecture and actually do the practice problems. | He's fair and his lectures aren't too slow or too fast. He knows how to teach and is willing to answer questions. He does a lot of examples making it easier to understand. A solid professor would take again. | He answers questions well and goes over many examples to ensure students understand the material. However, it is much better if you pair the textbook with his lectures to get the most out of his class. Overall, he is a nice guy and very fair. | So throughout the whole semester, he kept mentioning that he didn't look at the canvas grade. It won't be your final grade. At last, everyone just got the grade automatically from the canvas. I am confused why I got a D; he doesn't even reply to your email. DONT TAKE HIS COURSE, PLEASE"
"Jalali, Shirin","Dr. Shirin is an amazing professor and gives you a lot chances to succeed in this class. Lecture style is very clear and gives plenty of examples that you have the possibility of getting tested on. I would 100% take a course with her again. | She is a great professor at explaining topics and understanding the lectures. It can be hard when the class is very fast-paced and it is very easy to get lost. Luckily, she uses most of her content from lecture and homework problems so it is highly recommended to study the lecture slides | This class is test heavy and if you want a good grade she uses a lot of the material you learned in class or for quizzes and makes it very similar to them which is great if you have the time to study through them. I think she is a good teacher in explaining things when you ask her for help otherwise lectures are not too helpful due to little time."
"Bajwa, Waheed U.","He gives a lot and he expects a lot. You will have a ton of useful resources but the course workload is extremely demanding. You will learn a ton in the course and will also comprehend the content well if you put in the time/effort. Test are fair but are comprehensive. Puts a lot of effort into the course. Receptive to student challenges. | Bajwa is a nice guy and good teacher, but is simply ignorant to the amount of work he gives to students. Most classes have quizzes, exams, a final, and mandatory attendance. He has Video Quizzes, Assessment Quizzes, 4 Lectures a week (2 more assigned for you to watch at home), Homework, a Final, and a Group Final Project. Averages were in the 50's. | I took this class in Spring 2020. He didn't care about the pandemic and assigned a lot of work. You have to do a quiz before class, during class and his homework were a headache. Don't skip class, you're only hurting yourself | He really is a good teacher but this is an extremely hard class. I do wish the final project was a group project or atleast a smaller project. But I did get experience in working with python libraries and you will definitely learn a lot. The pace of the class was fast for me but everyone is different. It's a good class with great professor | He could care less that a global pandemic was going on. He assigned so much work and gave no time to fully complete it. Also, he never prepared you for the work. Took off so many points for getting things wrong and were not lenient at all with grading. Made a group project a solo project. Webcam and Workspace to been seen, worse than proctortrack | a very decent professor who really cares about his students! well-organized class and clear logic. highly recommended! | Bajwa is one of the best professors in ECE and people who complain about him dont deserve him. I learned so much in his class despite i almost failed his prereq class LSS. I enjoyed the course, and he truly cares about his students and their success. His exams are very fair and nothing surprising. His flipped class might come off unorthodox. | Bajwa is the man. Generally a very nice guy who puts in a lot of work into his students. The homework takes time, but it is absolutely doable within a reasonable period. He is also a very engaging professor, and a stone cold killa | Professor Scolds us at 8:40 for being on our phones after assigning 5-6 hours of homework due in class. He has no how much work he assigns or how the student's feel doing his work. He is also pompous and stuck up. If you want to be burred in busy work and have an overall unenjoyable semester take his class. | I took 3 classes with him and I got 3 A's. However, I hate his teaching. Boring boring and boring. Don't take his class. | Professor Bajwa uses a flipped class teaching method and you can tell he truly cares about his students. In the beginning, the videos can be a drag but pay attention to them and take notes it will help you during in class problems. The tests can be a bit challenging, there was some solid curves in my class, but overall I left loving the class. | The king of busy work. If you need a professor to hold your hand through the semester so you don't fail, he's your guy. If you're a decent student who can manage their own time well and learn material on their own, his constant homeworks and quizzes just become tedious and repetitive. | Bajwa best. | Best professor in ECE department. A lot of work involved, in class and outside of class, but the repetition of material and examples definitely helps come exam time. Midterms aren't especially challenging but the final is tough. The amount of work he puts into the class makes you want to work even harder. | One of the best ECE professors at Rutgers. He's tough, but he genuinely cares about how his students perform. He splits the grading so that doing poorly on exams won't end you (thankfully!), and you have opportunities to make up for it. Class attendance is mandatory because of these mini problems he makes you do, so it's more like recitation. | You can learn a lot from Dr. Bajwa's vast resources as he truly cares about the class. However the content of the class can be challenging if your Math foundation isn't good. The downside is that Dr. Bajwa takes everything so personally to the point that he can make the class very uncomfortable with his direction esp. for class participation. | Very hard material to understand. Mostly because the DSP book by Oppenheim is HORRIBLE. Try using different DSP books and not this one. Also, final was very tough. 1st midterm was a little tough, but second midterm was easy. He's very helpful if you go to his office hours and he's always willing to help out! | The hardest prof. I have ever seen, exams are nightmare, homeworks are IMPOSSIBLE. If you are smart enjoy As else Enjoy Fs | The professor was very clear when lecturing and always helpful in office hours. He allowed us to use our notes/books/hw solns on the exams. HW was simple & exams were C+P of hw. Exams were too easy so avgs were very high, as a result final was super hard; took many people out of the A range. Also final was hard to punish cheaters with soln manual. | probably the best teacher in this department. while that may not be saying much, given how bad some of our professors are, bajwa really does try his best to help the class understand the material. The homework is pretty ridiculous but the midterms are pretty easy. the final is also ridiculous but he curves well."
"Pepe, Russell","Terrible rambling lecture style. Grades essays arbitrarily based off of other students answers, which is not a fair method. Very unorganized with material, interjects her personal interests into course even when it is not relevant. She spent 2 weeks on women in Islam when it was not a central part of the course. | She is easily the nicest professor I have ever had. She is incredibly intelligent on the topic and the class is simple and straightforward. There are a lot of readings with some quizzes but if you just skim them, you'll be fine. She literally gives you the exams in the form of a study guide! And the group project is easy. Highly recommend her | Oh, boy. Avoid. Yes, she's a nice lady but what's the point of she's a terrible teacher? She gives so many dry, superfluous readings that no one does & then gives you exams & pop quizzes on them. She fails to respond to students' needs effectively & has punished the whole class for what a few ppl have done - Ex: taking away the final study guide! | We don't do anything in class. She never properly teaches and just shows a movie or something. The readings are far too long and incomprehensible. You're forced to cram and teach yourself 9 chapters worth of information for each exam. | Very nice teacher but the class isn't an easy A, it requires a lot of reading and the textbook is very dry. | Great professor. Kind of a large lecture hall, so hard to stay focused. Class wasn't too hard. Need to pay attention and try to do the readings. Not that easy for a 101 class, but still learn a good deal. I would recommend. | Excellent professor, and a VERY, VERY KIND person. She is very knowledgeable, and the class overall was great, except for 1 or 2 parts here and there. The exams were easy, she gives you the questions on it ahead of time. The assignments were also easy. She made the class quite interesting, though sometimes the discussions impeded that Def Recommend | The class was relatively easy, and she is a very, very sweet women. However, I didn't enjoy the material at all - and overall, I would say I didn't really get much out of the course. I wouldn't recommend the class. | I really didn't like her as a teacher, although she was VERY SWEET! I didn't really get much from the class. I feel it was very opinion based and the lectures were mostly discussion. I am not of this religion or culture so it was hard for me to keep up with discussion I had no idea what was going on in the class 95% of the time and received a B. | very sweet and nice, extremely interesting. loved this class os much that im now taking women and Islam w her, and im a science major! do urself a favor, do not graduate b4 taking 1 of her casses. amazing, u will learn LOADS! | Probably the nicest professor at Rutgers. The class isn't particularly hard, but it requires some effort. I heard many students complain about the main text (Berkey) but she covers the important information from the text in class. If you skip class a lot it's probably not a good idea (attendance and quizzes). Overall I enjoyed the course material. | She needs to get a speech training asap. I can't seem to get past ten minutes. Good material, but presentation could have been better. She seems extremely nice and pleasant, but her style? I don't know what to say. | Easiest course ever, so if your looking for an easy A then this is the course for you. But the material is vast and actually learning about the subject was great with Prof Jones. She is clear, very approachable, and always tries to help you at every turn. One of the few great prof's at RU. | She's very sweet and prob. 1 of d best prof to teach a debateable course. She needs a little organization with notes, lectures and articles that we were supposed to read. She's not a very tough grader and gives extra credits. Final grade is based on many things not just exams or attendance. There's a weekly journal that one must submit.Overall easy | Had her before she went on leave to finish her pHD. She's really helpful, and likes to mix things into her lecture. Grading on papers/ exams can be tough, but take good notes and you should be fine. I got a B+, missed a couple of classes but I studied with a group when finals came, really helped me out."
"Garrido, Luis","Profesor Garrido was one of the best professors I've had at Rutgers! He is pretty lienient with assignments, and a very reasonable grader. He's a really great guy and you should definitely take his class!"
"Ramanathan, Shriram","Autocad was great with shriram. He is an awsome teacher, but will want you to figure out somethings before you ask him. He's fun"
"Reagan, Randall","Easy professor | He is a very helpful and friendly professor, very straightforward with his expectations for students. | He is a new professor at Rutgers ISE department. Is possibly one of the best and kindest professors in my engineering experience thus far."
"Mercurio, Steven","Dr. Medlar is the best professor I've taken at Rutgers University. He's a practical engineer having worked at CDM Smith for a very long time. He's extremely knowledgabe in the fields of Water and Wastewater, and his stories will amaze you. Grade is never a concern in his class. If your a Civil Engineering student you need take his classes. Period. | He makes the class very very interesting, and he has tons of experience in the water | Easily one of the greatest professors i've had. Will go out of his way to help you and offers great advice. Much thanks to this man. | By far the most knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and inspiring professor I have ever had. He never reads from note cards or the slides, he knows A LOT about water! Great contact to have in the professional world, too. | Awesome awesome guy!! He knows basically everything about water!!! | This guy will go out of his way to help anyone anytime. He makes the class very very interesting, and he has tons of experience in the water and waste water field. He doesn't teach many undergrad classes at Rutgers but if you can I would highly reccomend taking him."
"Matthewson, John","Simply amazing, I've never seen a professor who goes above and beyond for his students like he does. | Professor McGarvey should be the example that all other ECE professors strive to be. This man explains things thoroughly and thanks to his numerous years working in industry he can relate examples to real world applications. His grading scheme is extremely fair especially thanks to the numerous projects. BY FAR THE BEST ECE PROFESSOR. | Easily one of the best professors I've had, He gives extensions when he sees that the class is behind and provide extra video lectures to make sure you understand the material. | Probably one of the best professors I have had so far. He actually cared about us doing well and was willing to give as much help as we needed. He always answered as many questions as he could. He was a little slower as to his older age, but other than that he was funny and lectures were fine. He was easy to contact and discuss topics with. | Good lectures with supplementary tools on canvas."
"Sills, Ryan","Mostly asynchronous course with a couple big blue button meetings. Wants to get through the material as fast as we do. Recorded lectures are dry and long. Sometimes dwells a bit too much on certain topics. Lacks energy. 12 discussion posts, a presentation, 2 homework assignments, and a classroom management plan. Easy grader and assignments."
"Gurvich, Mark","Clear, concise material and grading systems. Office Hours are very helpful for completing/understanding the homework. Exams are extremely fair and cover exactly what we were taught. Final Project is very straightforward, easily one of my favorite BME classes so far at Rutgers. | Everythings been said already, but does not grade tests fairly as there is low to none feedback on them. Hard homeworks and does not try to give any help towards the end of the course for those who may really need it. | Graded on 4 homeworks (35%), mid-term and final exams (20% each, open notes), project (20%), attendance (5%). Cut-offs (A,B+,B,C+,C,D) at 84%, 78%, 71%, 65%, 60%, 45%. Class mean 73.9%. Exam/homework solutions posted, past practice exams posted, lecture slides posted. Easy to do well if you take it seriously, easy to do badly if you don't. | Few tests and confusing long lectures. Does not give back much feedback on tests and seems to grade them based on whether you show up to class or not, not if you actually did well on the exams. | Professor Pierce will educate you well on the topic he's teaching. He knows his material thoroughly, but he paces his way through the lecture material so you can understand it. He's a tough but fair grader, you'll have to earn every point. If you listen in class and take notes you'll do fine. His accent is the verbal equivalent of smooth jazz | Great professor, reiterates in the lectures what's important for exams which makes them easy to prepare for. You are required to think analytically and not just regurgitate information mindlessly which some people below may have expected. There are few homework assignments that are of similar format to the exams so you know what to expect. | Does not care about the students as the tests have no type of feedback on them. Only 2 tests and a project determine your grade, if u cant make a few classes youre basically down to a C already. Very hard to talk to and no type of extra credit no matter what the situation is. | Makes it hard to do well cause theres too much emphasis on exams while there is only 2 exams. If he knows your name it can be good but more likely to be bad because he will not give any help or lehway in your final grade. As a senior try to avoid global health because it could potentially ruin your chances of getting a job after the grading. | Is generally very clear and speaks in a way that is engaging. Homework assignments are easy. Tests require little additional preparation other than attending lecture or a brief review of the material. Nice guy always willing to answer questions or correct mistakes. | Cares for his students. Tests are long but exactly what should be expected based on practice exams. Helpful in office hours. Really cool guy overall!"
"Chundawat, Shishir","Has homework about every other week based on lectures. Has quizzes every week which are based on the lectures of the previous week. Both midterm and final are extremely fair and based on the coursework. Never wants to trick you, always wants you to do well."
"Guo, Ashley","takes forever to put in grades. i went the whole semester thinking i would finish with an A but put in midterm grades the last few days of the course and my grade dropped to a B - nothing was offered to reconcile this sudden drop or review for the midterm even though i did very well on the final paper | Her classes are very difficult. She is also a very tough grader. She takes forever to get grades in and left 0s as placeholders so it's difficult to gauge where you are in the class. if you can, take a different professor. | BEWARE!! If you hate group work and I mean truly despise group work DO NOT take this Prof. Groups are assign the first week of class and you have to work together the whole semester. No quizzes and no exams. Just mini assignments and final 10 pg. paper. Overall she is very nice and will help you understand her lectures."
"Shapley, Nina","A very nice professor who wants you to well never want to trick you | The most kind and friendly professor I have met in my life. She sticks to the syllabus and very organised. She explains the difficult concepts multiple times in class. She explains the concepts and solves standard problems. Meet her in office hours, you will learn a lot in Transport. Difficult to get A but easy to pass. Solve exercise problems. | One of the best professors I have come across at Rutgers! Very, very helpful and gives you many opportunities to pull your grade up- make up assignments, group projects. She doesn't assign enough homework though which makes the exams harder! Extremely helpful when approached with doubts and explains concepts very clearly!"
"Ogunkanmi, Anuoluwa","rude for no reason , she moves extremely fast through curriculum the whole class was a lost we had to make our own group chat to discuss after class. didn't grasp the concept of empathy and that we have to teach ourselves curriculum in a worldwide pandemic while life has completely changed around us. suck it oreo | if i could give this woman zero stars i would. if she's your only option i'm so sorry. i took this behemoth's class during a WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. this teletuuby is a waste of space idk why she chose this profession but she's not meant for. she's an butthol, extremely inaccessible, and has a disgusting attitude when you asked genuine questions. F HER | Oreofe is a very rude, unprofessional person. She goes through the content so quickly that most of the class is lost, and then acts like we're stupid. If you email her, she'll ignore you and pretend that she already answered your question in the lecture. She's completely inaccessible. | As a person, shes not so bad. As a TA, she sure has no patience. Maybe its a culture barrier, regardless she made the class extremely overwhelming and just confused people more than they should. She would move entirely too fast and would yell at us when she was the one who confused us to begin with. You've been warned."
"Demetracopoulou, Vassiliki","Professor Panoussi is incredibly knowledgeable and cares a lot about her students, but the class is very challenging. Be prepared for translating 200 lines of latin alongside reading a 15-20 page academic paper each wekk. She makes sure everyone participates in class by translating 15 lines from the homework, so be warned if this gives you anxiety | Wonderful professor, very helpful, encouraging and enthusiastic. Professor Panoussi knows how to spark thoughtful and interesting class discussions. Lots of homework, but all worth it. Your Latin knowledge will improve, guaranteed. Exams have extra credit and are not graded too harshly. She makes sure everyone gets to translate in class. | Professor Panoussi is deeply knowledgeable and confident. Usually this is helpful and she is very caring, but at times she can be insistent on things being done her way. She does her best to ensure everyone participates, and is willing to help with translations in class. | Professor Panoussi is very passionate about ancient literature and it shows. She makes class both interesting and enjoyable. The secondary readings aren't the most fun but they are crucial for a large part of the grade. I recommend taking Greek & Roman Myth (CLCV 205) first. If you love actual mythology, TAKE THIS CLASS! | She is a kind woman and she loves what she was teaching, but often she forgets her students are not classics majors and have more classes than just hers. You'll have a lot of reading and she grades essays harshly, but with a lot of feedback. Her discussions did not help me personally and rarely were applicable in the work she assigned. | I am a Classics major, so I chose to take this class. Panoussi is a intimidating at first, but LOVES her subject and her students. She is brilliant and had amazing things to say every day. the homework was intense, I spent 4-6 hours preparing for each class, and I needed to do the translations about 3 times to really be ready for class. BE PREPARED | Panoussi is a very enthusiastic, warm person. While the assigned reading is extensive, you can get away with skimming and spark noting if you attend every class. She only tests on concepts that have been covered in lecture. She encourages student participation, but only calls on those who are clearly willing to participate. I liked this class. | Professor Panoussi is wonderful but can be very intimidating. She assigns a lot of Latin to have prepared for each class, and she will correct you if you make mistakes when you translate. Exams are very straightforward - just translating material you've gone through in class. She is also incredibly helpful outside of class. | Avoid her if you can. I love Greek/Roman history and mythology, but she ruined it for me. She is incredibly rude to students. She went off at my class for caring about our grades and said they ""don't matter"". She often turns off the ppt during class because she gets annoyed when people take notes while she's talking. | Terrible professor and class. She glosses over real history and is extremely rude if you question her. Quizzes are a joke and 30% of the grade. Rest of the grade is midterm and final. Midterm is graded beyond harshly and you will get no expectations or info going into it. 100+ term study guide, test had maybe 12 of them. Never take this class. | I really enjoyed this class. You have A LOT of reading, but she chooses topics that are interesting, and also she breaks down all the reading the next day in class so you really understand. In a class of about 50 students, she went out of her way to memorize people's names and make them feel listened to. She is a really great and caring professor | Wonderful, passionate professor. Her lectures are always involved and interesting. If you take this class, though, prepare to read! You are accountable for keeping up with the syllabus, and she expects you to know your stuff. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, the class is very enjoyable | Very Strict on essays. Nice teacher but i dreaded the class | I had this professor for my freshman seminar. Overall she was great, and I really enjoyed the class. I would certainly take another course with her. My only complaint is that it takes a while for her to grade & hand back papers, and no one ever knew what his grade was at any given time. | If you want to do well in her Latin class, study for each class. She recommends 3 hours per 50 minutes spent in the classroom. You should expect daily quizzes. | Tests cover a wide range of info and seemed to cover minute details. A lot of reading for every class. You should be ready to put in a lot effort towards doing well this class I would only recommend taking this class if you are a classics major or are very interested in ancient greece | Very frustrating class. There was an abundance of info and note taking was a pain due to teaching style. The professor was funny and excited about the subject, but was hard to follow and would jump from subject to subject. | Very enthusiastic about the material. Requires you to memorize a lot of dates and places, but she gives a study guide and if you pay attention in class and do the readings, you can do very well. | Do the readings AND go to class. She does not post lectures and encourages us not to take notes. She is a bit abrasive. Also, some of her test questions did not match what she gave us in the notes. Her lectures are very scattered. Two midterms are harder, but the final was easy. | I loved her class. She is an excellent professor who tries to make the material accessible to everyone. She tells you everything that is important in class and if you do the readings (at least before the test) you won't e lost. There was a lot of reading, but it was definately worth it. | Attend class and take notes from the slides because she doesn't post all of them. Sometimes she will shut off the powerpoints in the middle of notes (and test questions come from the powerpoints). There is A LOT of reading. Not worth the 2 GERS. You might as weel take 2 separate classes and do less reading. Tests are not bad as long as you read. | Loved Panoussi! Very passionate about her subject and that passion is contagious I assure you! I am a Bio major and this became one of my favorite classes! PLEASE DO THE READINGS BEFORE THE CLASS! Usually only a few people do it and the discussion becomes centered around the few if everyone did it you would learn more! | very passionate about the stuff she teaches. very helpful, very accessible, very charming. latin is a hard class itself, which has nothing to do with the professor. but if you take her, you'll get some extra fuel to go to class. | Great Professor! Very funny and really keeps the lectures interesting. Sometimes goes off on tangents but at least they are amusing. Tests not incredibly difficult, but cover a good amount of information. Loved this class! | She is wonderful and full of life, you can really tell that she loves the subject and is proud of where she comes from. She is always ready to help if you ask for it. Highly recommended! | Professor P's intro to latin prose class was ALOT of work to keep up with. The translations she assigned daily were generally very difficult but the class isn't too hard to get a decent grade in and she's a very lenient grader. She's very funny and quirky. | Love her. Her lectures were clear, consice and truly helped when studying for her exams. Her tests are fair as long as you do the readings and she'll help you with anything. Her Greek backgrounds owes her a great deal of experience and a different prespective on Mythology, which was interesting and entertaining. Again, love her. | Great professor, but expect a LOT of work. Translate a lot of latin every night. I did more for this class than my history Colloqium. That being said, she's funny, sweet, and really cares about her class and students. | Got onto tangents easily and slowed down the lectures, but did better second semester. Take good class notes and tests will be a breeze. Don't overthink the tests; she doesn't try to make them incredibly hard. | Meh. Lecture and readings and interesting, but lecture is way more comprehensive than tests. Overstudying was a problem that lowered my grade on all 3 tests. She was an engaging professor, but class was boring b/c no one did the readings (typical lecture GER). | Great professor, especially if you are interested in the subject. Smart, doesn't go off on tangents, but sometimes dwells. Willing to discuss topics after class, very friendly. Exams look harder than they are, lots of basic facts. Broad study guides provided, easier grader than Chesley. Read everything! Would recommend. | She is a fascinating passionate industrious and knowledgeable professor. Her way of teaching is kind of 'ambitious', but actually she gave quite easy tests. So she is also a considerate professor. Very nice middle age woman!!! | this is a really hard and boring class. dont take it! she expects wayy too much from her students, so much reading. i was happy with my grade at the end, but im never taking another classics class again! | she was so nice, but was so boring. class was basically her coming up with questions, pose them to class, and wait forever until some1 answered. that said, you have to READ or be uncomfortable. It was pretty bad. She is so nice, really so nice, but...boring. tests were hard, but you can do that part if you go to class, take notes..study the PP. ok. | Though she is really friendly & funny, Panoussi expected way too much from us. Exams are really tough, especially for someone like me who has never studied classical civilization. A lot of details. I loved the class for its content (which is heavier on CLCV than WMST), but not the reading load of an english class or the difficulty of history exams. | Adorable professor, and really knows what she's talking about. While the study guides are very broad tests are easy to study for and very straight-forward. You dont have to go to class, but it's recommended (she takes time to learn people's names). I'd take another class with her in a heartbeat. | She is a wonderful professor! I wasn't too sure about the class going in, but she is so entertaining she makes any lesson fun. I had a blast with her and am planning on taking more of her classes in the future. I would recommend her in any class she is teaching."
"Lateef, Omer","Very challenging course, no joke. But his lectures are amazing if you are actually interested in EE, although sometimes he gets very deep into topics. Very long HWs, Pop-quizzes given. But the curve is actually really nice. a F-> C and D -> B+. Although its very hard, I would very recommend him, because you actually learn a lot."
"Kruger, Dov","Very kind and accessible outside of class. His knowledge of software and engineering history is great! | Kruger was very kind and very accessible outside of class. His class is very easy even though the concepts aren't. The study guide is basically copied and pasted. Lectures are not mandatory, and he has an iconic pose :) | People might say he was disorganize but if you just go talk to him he is always ready to help and tell you all the information you need to know. For exams he has always been clear about what will be on the exams. And he is passionate about the field so he always add new things which might not be on the exams. | Dov Kruger is extremely disorganized and rambles the entire lecture. He has a million things on GitHub and discord but good luck finding what you're looking for. The exam topics are no where near the same as what he “teaches” but if you study the day before the exam you'll be fine. He forgets to post hw in advance and randomly changes due dates. | Are his lectures organized? Not particularly. But he makes it clear on multiple occasions that he is learning the material with us, which sounds bad, but it means he is extremely lenient with grading and exams. If you put forth ANY effort in this class, you will do well. He is an amazing individual who is honest and only wants you to succeed. | Dov Krutger is a passionate professor who truly cares about his students' success. He takes time to ensure everyone understands the material and is always eager to help. However, his occasional disorganization can hinder learning. Emmanuel Hove, being more organized, offers a smoother experience. | Dov Krutger is an amazing professor who genuinely cares about his students' success. He takes the time to ensure everyone understands the material and is always willing to help. While he can be a bit disorganized at times, his passion for teaching shines through. The traffic light lab was a highlight—both fun and educational! | Absolutely do not. The person that rated this man a 5 needs a check in. Im doing fairly well in the class but he uses sources like github(never seen nor heard beforehand) and discord. Dont even both contacting through email. Ghosted me for 5 days on discord only to receive a reply to do the SIRS form (not even answer my question). | I made this post to refute some of the previous year claims. While I cannot attest that he may have been disorganized in previous years he certainly is not now. He is one of the most accessible ECE professors maintaining a discord and numerous office hours. I would highly recommend taking his class, he gives multiple opportunities to succeed. | Very disorganized. Barely taught the material we needed to know. At least he wanted students to succeed but he really needs to work on his structure. | This professor was INCREDIBLY disorganized throughout the semester. His TA's did all the work for him, he barely answered questions, didn't post lecture material even when promised, and would give surprise homework assignments that no one knew about and he didn't mention in class, and then threatened to lower our grades if we asked to review them. | The legit worst professor ever. If you have him, RUN! So unorganized and leeched off the TA's to do all his work. The most unorganized professor who did not post any material. Threatened students with dropping grades if we asked questions. | This is his first year teaching this course and reading from the reviews from Stevens, it is true that he is disorganized at the start. He created his own teaching style and didn't use last year's slides. He genuinely want us to succeed and he tries his best. I feel like his biggest problem was communication."
"Raghunandan, Krishnamurthy","Online course utilized McGraw Hill SimNET, did not have much interaction with instructor. Weekly Excel assignments accounted for 40% of grade, 3 Exams 46%, and the Access portion (3 weeks + 1 exam) was 14%.Typical weekly assignments are reading, SimNET then shows you examples of the function/skill, and you will repeat and do it yourself."
"Liu, Hang","Horrible professor, should not be teaching by any means. She has absolutely no work experience hence should not be teaching construction management. Just cause someone has a pHD, should not be the reason one should be teaching construction management. Waste of money, worst professor. Pick someone who has a more reputable background and experience. | She is trying though. Tries to make it simple for students | Don't do it. Grading is super harsh for exams and homework, reads directly off the lecture slides and barely seems to know what she's teaching. You won't learn anything and exams have nothing conceptual on them. Don't waste your time or money."
"Zhang, Zhao","He gives you a pop quiz almost every class. Exams are fair, but the way they're graded is either you're right or you're completely wrong, so don't expect PC. He also does not give you his lecture slides. He's not a bad lecturer but he doesn't care if you pass or fail and will not help you. You're better off learning directly from a book. | Just to warn everyone in ECE, Dr. Zhao's Power Devices class has nothing to do with Power Electronics and Circuits. Unless you understand the Physics of Electronic Devices (holes and electrons), this class can be a nightmare as Dr. Zhao's perspective of an Electrical Engineering foundation is extremely intense. This class is extremely demanding. | Professor was acceptable for DE; he dropped his usual powerpoint method and just taught from his notes which was more helpful than previous. His exams were very fair for the class. It helps if you write down what he says along with whats on the board -- goes a long way in getting ready for tests. | Class was okay... it seemed difficult in the beginning because the book explained how to analyze small signal diodes in such a backwards way and the professor did nothing to expand on that (because all he did was read from the book, he TORE PAGES OUT, brought them to class, and wrote them on the board). his exams are simple/straightforward. | alrite, i dont know what these other people are smoking, but zhao is not a great teacher, he shouldnt be a teacher at all. he is unclear, his exams are insanly hard (33 average on the final) and his metaphors suck. he wastes like an hour explaining how he combined 2 resistors in parallel , and then doesn't explain anything he does in transistors. | Great teacher, he will answer questions, and he knows the material in great detail. It is a hard class, but if you do all the homework and study, you will get an A. Exams are homework problems. If you just study before exams and do some homework, you will pass. He wants the entire class to pass, so he teaches well. | the best prof i ever had...knows his stuff... | Difficult course. Only a mediocre teacher, at best. | really good..fair exams"
"Chung, Taerin","took korean lit class and it was easy as long as you did assigned work. most of the time you'll get b+ or higher on any papers as long as you follow the rubrics. he appreciates participation but doesn't grade you out of it (in class). | Participate! Itll kill your grade if you dont | The workload is a little much sometimes but prof. Chung makes the material super interesting. Office hours is really helpful. He takes notice if you participate and do the work. If you're interested in Korean history or Korean culture/cinema, take this class. I only say tough grader because he gives all 90-93s. Nothing higher but nothing lower"
"Guirguis, Caroline","Caro is wonderful! She's deeply passionate about the content of the course, she's accessible outside of class, and she gives incredibly thorough feedback! She also does give extra credit! | Prof. Pirri is caring, understanding, encouraging, and she wants you to succeed. She has very clear grading criteria, explains what she wants from you and how to achieve that. She gives a lot of practice workshops during the class time and very accessible outside of the class. Her feedbacks are great, thorough and helpful. Also very nice and funny. | POETRY SECTION: really fun. she sometimes drags on class and doesnt get to what she says she will. | Caro Pirri is a great teacher. This isnt an easy class but shes definitely the right person for it. I can say she made me a better writer for sure, and will do the same for anyone as long as youre willing to put in work. | Caro was the TA for this class - she was really into the poetry that we were reading and made every section fun to attend - she made line-by-line analysis really engaging. If you participate a lot, then extra bonus. Make sure to take notes in section because a lot of good discussion goes on. Really flexible if you have conflicts with office hours | It wasn't an easy class. Just try your best and you'll do fine! She's awesome! | She is really a patient prof. Since my class conflicted with her office hours, she answered the questions that i emailed her. And her answer was really long and helpful and exactly written by herself. However, she is very strict. It is difficult to pass her class. Her speaking is very fast and her handwriting is not good."
"Hubler, Jesse","The course material was presented well and was very interesting. | Sweet man. Classes were split between him and another professor, you would hope that it would be Rodenbiker teaching each day. Not a hard course at all, know the study guides well and you can probably get an A? Homework was tedious, though not too hard either."
"Reagan, Randy","Easy professor | He is a very helpful and friendly professor, very straightforward with his expectations for students. | He is a new professor at Rutgers ISE department. Is possibly one of the best and kindest professors in my engineering experience thus far."
"Yousefian, Farzad","He is nice and very smart, but I think he expects us to be experts on everything before the class even begins. 3 difficult projects using Xpress (which he doesn't teach you how to use) and he assigned a project due finals week that he told us about right before dead week. He's not very helpful because he just refers you back to PowerPoint slides."
"Reihani, Amin",Prof Reihani is new so this class was a bit rocky. He taught well & was very thorough. Treat renewable energy as a grad level class. Assignments are few but are demanding. Uses MatLab for HW & exams so be prepared. He grades fairly but assignments take forever & are hard. He answers email questions ASAP. Overall good professor just difficult course
"Shinbrot, Troy","I really liked him. I was at first worried due to the grades people gave him on this cite, but he was great. You need to work in the class and try your best, but I think anyone could do well (at least a B) if they just dedicate enough time to the material. He is accessible outside of class, especially by email. Don't skip class or prepare to fail. | Should not be a teaching professor. His jargony classed do not sync with the homework questions. Does not care about students and has an extreme superiority complex. | He's a good lecturer and sings for the class. He bases lecture off of the book he wrote which he provides for free. The homework is all Matlab which is barely related to class, but he is very helpful during office hours and often gives the code. He made the exam remote and open note because we asked for it. Biggest downside is unclear grading | Terrible. Due to his ""Histogram"" grading system somebody always has to fail. If 99% of people got a 100 in the class and the 1% gets a 97 then that 1% will receive a very poor grade due to his histogram nonsense. This dude is a bully, he has some type of complex and may be compensating for something who knows. SmolPeenEnergy. | Never seen such an incompetent professor in my life. Even for grad school he's terrible. Expects so much with such little teaching and grades unfairly. He rounds down full letter grades. He needs to leave the teaching industry because this is not for him! | The WORST BME professor @ Rutgers. You will learn nothing. Avoid at ALL costs. Gives you unrelated, extremely hard coding homeworks in multiple languages without even teaching you coding. Everything he does is extremely vague & makes no sense. Worst professor for reaching out to as well. Take thermo a different semester and you will actually learn. | Dr. Shinbrot is a genius. Due to his extensive knowledge of the field, the challenge of this class is reflected in exam expectations. Very grateful for a professor who fully and completely understands his field, but his extensive knowledge comes at a cost; heightened expectations. You will learn, but it will hurt. | We needed 105-110 to get an A. He only gives the top 10% an A and they are exempt from the final. He's a bad teacher. You'll learn nothing. Told his grader to just give grades saying something like ""You know which kids are the smart ones now"". Do yourself a favor and take this class off season with another teacher. | I can honestly say I did not learn a thing about Thermodynamics and Kinetics this whole semester. His lectures were very dry, the LA gave us the answers to all the homework problems, and his grading methods were extremely unfair. If you want to learn, take another professor. If you want to simply get the class over with, take him. | Took him for Math Modeling, possibly one of the worst professors I've had. Decent lecturer but his thoughts and topics are disjointed and don't really give you an understanding of the big picture. Homeworks are purely coding based and do not use many in class concepts. One time he made 2 hws and a project due on the same day in a 2 week span."
"Roth, Charles","Soos' lectures are outstanding. He is very rigid with how things are done. The class is a lot of work and you have to be on top of everything in order to do well. I did 2 chapters a week (which was a lot of work) and got an A. This class is not easy, but very interesting. Class is graded by 2 exams. Do well on the midterm and you'll be fine | If you plan to go to law school, you should really take this class even if it is difficult. The material teaches you a lot, and the asynchronous does catch up to you. For exams, do mylab questions bc they help understand the material way better. Final is harder than midterm, but midterm wasn't bad and no curve. Soos is the best lecturer at RU | This class was completely asynchronous which is the only thing that sucked. JUST READ THE TEXTBOOK MAKE QUIZLETS AND DO THE MYLAB HOMEWORK and you will get a decent grade. Midterm was very straightforward nothing too hard as long as you studied. I suppose final will be the same. I heard he can be rude in email but I didn't experience this. PROCTOR* | Look, there's a reason that as students we are given the option to take Ethics instead of this class. It's hard. If you skip, don't read, don't put all of your effort into this class. You will fail. If you are a lazy beta and half-ass your way through classes like most of the children at this school, take Ethics, you can't handle this class. | This class is a ton of work and is scary because its 50/50 and the exams are hard BUT the textbook is NOT a boring read or loaded with unnecessary material. Soos is also a fair guy. He was helpful whenever I reached out to him. Read the textbook. Make your notes from that. Use him in class to listen and make additions to your textbook notes. | Had Soos for BLaw 1. So much readings. Impossible to get extra credit on the MyLab (the quizzes are hard, impossible to get 90s unless you use internet for answers, which I didn't use.) 50% Midterm, 50% Final. Very hard exams. Not there for you when you have questions. Very condescending and rude. Do not take if possible unless in accounting major | 40% midterm and 40% final 20% discussion board. Exams require a thorough understanding of the textbook, which has A LOT of information. I got a 98 on the midterm but was still scared of even passing because his exams are 100 questions and tough. 5% extra credit on the final grade if you get a certain % on optional homework but he's really stubborn | He's a great lecturer. You don't need to go to class but you should. The material of his class was fairly hard but the exams make it very hard. Adding to that the course is 50% midterm and 50% final and you really don't have room for error. If you get a 90% on every homework assignment (not average, every assignment) you get 5% extra credit. Huge. | From a learning standpoint, one of the best classes Ive ever taken due to Soos being an amazing lecturer and the course material being very relevant. The 50% midterm 50% final structure is tough but fair. You need to keep up with the material and read the chapter in detail before class. Soos is secretly a professional baseball player. | Business Law is one of the hardest courses in RBS, but Soos is a great professor who explains the material very well. Absolutely make sure you attend class and do all the MyLab assignments, as you can earn 5 extra points on your final grade. 50/50 midterm/final split, with the final being significantly harder than the midterm. No curve. Good Luck! | Soos is a tough professor who demands the most out of his students. The entire class is graded off the midterm and final (with extra credit that's almost impossible to get) so you really have to work hard to do well. He mentions some concepts in his lectures that aren't in the book, so it's worth going, and he does a great job explaining things. | Most inconsiderate and unprofessional professor at Rutgers Business School. Talks down to students. Yells at students in class and claims he has no problem ""embarrassing"" you. Going to class is a waste of time because he teaches directly from the book. 50% midterm and final. Will deduct points from final grade if Extra credit isn't done. Horrible. | To succeed, read the textbook CAREFULLY, attend the classes (Prof Soos will mention cases in class that aren't in the book and it's likely they will be on the exams), and do the homework before that lecture's topic. 50/50 grading. Midterm is straightforward, so do well on it because the final is more analytical. He never curves- no exceptions! | If you want to do well in this class, attend class and read the book. He currently uses a 50/50 grading system where two exams make up your whole grade, so you need to know the material inside and out. That being said, I believe he made his exams slightly easier over the past year, so the class was easier than I was expecting. I enjoyed this class! | He is one of the best and knowledgeable professors at Business School. ATTEND THE CLASSES. His exams are basically everything he mentions in the class. For notes taking, jot down all of the cases/examples he mentions in class. If he says ""this case"" is important, there are 95% chances that will be on the exam. | Irrational workload for a core level class. No curve despite dismal class average, and an unreasonable extra credit system. Skip him entirely and take Ethics | Yes, the material is hard, but it is also very straightforward - it's law. Dr. Soos grades on your exams (50/50) and if you finish all hw above 70% you get a small extra credit (though if you miss one you get points deducted instead). There's no attendance but please attend for your own sake. He's very knowledgeable on his field and replies fast. | Love Professor Soos! Great for both blaw 1 and 2. Great lectures. Respond to email fast. Tells funny jokes in class while explaining materials. Exams are straight forward if you do all necessary work. DO NOT USE cellphones in his class. For real. I mean it. | Exams are very difficult and you are only graded on your midterm and final. If you're looking to keep your gpa high, I'd suggest not taking this class. You are better off taking ethics instead. | This class is 50% midterm 50% final. Homework is mandatory, but you get no credit for doing it. If you mess up at any point in the semester, you're basically done. Would avoid if possible. | Despite what many of the reviews say here, Soos is a decent professor. He does not deviate from the syllabus and he is clear on what he expects from the class. Grade is 50% midterm and 50% final. Neither exam was particularly difficult (difficulty 4/10); reading the textbook and studying off test banks help a lot | Soos does not know how to teach. Repeating what was in the textbook is NOT teaching. We know what the textbook says because we read it. Students are expecting Soos to teach us in class how to apply the legal concepts and explicate real world cases. | Business Law 1 covers forty nine chapters and the first 24 chapters are on the first midterm and the remaining 24 chapters are on the final exam. Your grade is based on one midterm and one final exam. His lectures repeats the textbook and the PowerPoint slides, so there really isn't a point in going to class, except he makes you go to class. | This class covers 21 chapters and each chapter has 4 assignments due at different dates. Online, the assignments are organized by chapter and not due date just to make things more difficult. If you're the type of student to miss 1 assignment out of 84 (21 x 4) do not take this class because 5 points will be deducted from your final grade. | I took him thinking it would be hard. I was wrong. The grading criteria is straight forward 50/50 midterm and final. There is homework but it didn't count as a percentage of the grade. Go to class, make sure you pay attention and READ the textbook. First exam is really easy, second a little more difficult but still easy. Take him, you can get an A. | Professor Soos is a great professor. He is very smart and he knows the material like the back of his mind. However, he isn't the most approachable professor. He is intimidating and aloof. He is difficult for students to approach Professor Soos. | His lectures are interesting but it is impossible to get an A in this class unless you get 100 on midterm cause final is extremely hard | his exams are extremely hard. no matter how much you study there's no way you'll get an A. take business ethics if you're not an accounting major. | Ridiculously hard, better off taking Business Ethics. | 50% Midterm 50% Final, No one will get an A in the final. No Exceptions! | 50% midterm 50% final. Points deducted for missed class and failure of online quizzes | Look, with Soos what you see is what you get. He is extremely clear as to what he expects from you and what you should expect from the course. Show up to class, read the textbook and you should be just fine. Midterm is fair and the final is challenging but NOT impossible. I cant emphasize this enough: DO WELL ON THE MIDTERM! | Very clear lecturer and covers the material so well. If you took B-law I you are prepared for B-Law II. He is a great guy as well. | TAKE ETHICS INSTEAD!!!! Only take this professor if you are 1) an accounting manager or 2) thinking about law and don't care about your GPA. | There are 2 exams, 50% each. Nothing else counts toward your grade. But you get points taken off for missed attendance and failed online quizzes. The exams are hard, especially the final. Keep up with the readings from the beginning and complete the quizzes as you go over the chapter in class. Studying days before the exam will not work. | As others have said, this class has gotten a lot tougher. Attendance and completion of online quizzes are mandatory but don't count towards your grade percentage (instead you get points deducted if you miss a certain amount of classes fail a certain # of quizzes). Midterm is relatively easy, final is killer even if you study a lot. | This class was much easier than Blaw 1. Soos is also alot friendler in this class, probably because people take it as an elective and he respects that more. Only two exams, 50% each. Exams are very straightforward if you read the book. He did away with the extra credit he used to give but he still makes you take the online quizzes for each chapter. | This class is definitely more interesting than BLaw I. Only 2 exams as well, 50 mc each that make your grade. No extra credit. Worth it if you plan on reading and outlining 5 hours per week. Review a couple days before the exams to do well and study the details. | Going to class, participating and completing the chapter quizzes (close to 25 of them) only stop your grade from going down. The midterm and final are challenging and a lot of reading is required to keep up with the exams that cover between 10 and 15 chapters. Soos is disrespectful and sarcastically responded to my e-mail to him concerning my grade | So, He decided to get rid of his extra credit policy as of Fall of 2014 so those reviews are outdated. Instead of extra credits for attendance and quizzes, he is now giving out penalties for more than 3 absences and more than 3 missing quizzes. 50% Midterm, 50% Final. No negotiation, no mercy. Straight forward, pretty rough exams. | Merely an extension of BLaw 1. Except this time attendance was mandatory if you want the extra credit (can't miss more than 3 lectures). Go to class if you want the EC and read the book. If you do that you will be fine. Not sure why there are a lot of people who complain about this class. Its extremely straight forward. | Straight forward class. Pay attention, study and do the extra credit quizzes, and you will be fine. | He straight lectures and tells you a lot of examples from the concepts. You really need to read the book for this class, no joke. There are only two exams where pretty much if you mess up, you need to retake the class. The final exam is no way like the midterm. | This honestly was probably the most straightforward class I've ever taken. Only a midterm and final (50% each). He gives 5% extra credit to your final grade if you pass all the online quizzes and don't miss more than 3 lectures. He makes the material interesting and there are no surprises on his exams. Read each chapter and understand the concepts. | great professor, gives examples to everything and is extremely knowledgeable. you definitely need the book-don't need online code. slides are online, don't use electronics. final-50% and midterm-50% are kind of hard. outline chapters know all definitions--it's a lot. 5 points extra credit on top of total grade if you get >=70% on all quizzes. | Everyone who complains that Business Law 1 is hard probably just didn't put enough effort into this class. One of the most straight forward classes I have ever had, you must read every chapter in the book in order to succeed. Midterm is way easier than final, final is not too bad though. I received an A, read every chapter and outlined them each | class is fairly interesting given the dry material. he straight lectures, no powerpoints, no handwritten board notes. class is legitimately tough, requires a lot of diligence with reading and understanding the material. do not fall behind and make sure you do the extra credit. possible to get an A with hard work, despite not having a curve. | One of the best professors in the business school. He's very smart and a great lecturer. The class is not that easy and can be boring at times, but that's just the nature of the course. Blaw II is easier than Blaw I & Soos is much nicer in Blaw II. Worth taking especially for accounting major. | Professor Soos is a wonderful professor. His lecturing is flawless and he makes business law as interesting as it can be. People complain that the exams are hard, but if you read the book and go to class (what a concept)...The exams are highly doable. Just a midterm and a final 50% each. I learned a lot and will miss this class! | Prof. Soos is a nice guy and wants you to succeed. He helps put concepts from the book into understandable real-world explanations. However, you MUST read the book to do well. Notes from class help, but the book is much more detailed. Midterm and Final both worth 50% of your grade. Stay up to date on the reading!"
"Maikos, Jason","Prof Lewis was a really good teacher for this class. Admittedly he doesn't make it easy at all (aka quizzes were sometimes near impossible), but he will pass you regardless if he thinks you put in the work. Since it was a small class, he took a lot of time to answer questions and address concerns which helped me out a lot. | Funny professor and enthusiastic about the material. However, class is all about memorizing. He has a lot of slides on his lectures that are pictures, so definitely take notes on the specific topic for everything and you would do good. Have to go to lecture!! I didn't buy the book and I was fine. | Faunal Analysis. Man, this was a TOUGH course. Jason Lewis however made the course easier to digest by communicating science in a fun way and providing us with assistants / lab access. He gave us the tools to win which allowed many of us to stick through it all. He rocks. PS, this course needs to be 6 credits, not 3, but that is a RU issue. | I took Prof Lewis because the class seemed interesting and the his reviews were phenomenal. But! the class itself has to be the most difficult class I've taken so far. There is a lot of memorization for material (I feel) is not super fun to be memorizing. The exams are super difficult (and he knows it) so he gives a bunch of extra credit. | Jason Lewis is witty and charming and has extensive knowledge of the material he teaches. His experience as an archaeologist working with Richard Leaky allows Professor Lewis to garnish his lectures with interesting anecdotes. With so much experience, professor Lewis expects a lot from his students. Overall an extremely interesting course. | Excellent professor. Very knowledgeable. Funny! Very helpful with any questions and accomodating with extra help during office hours to get you caught up if you miss a class. Attendence is mandatory though if you want to do well on weekly practicals. I would definitely take a class he teaches again. | Great professor, very engaging in class and makes the material even more interesting! Posts slides so you can follow along easily but you still need to attend lecture. Really knows his stuff and as said before, he's very funny! Also, Sarah is a wonderful TA and is very helpful and nice. Previous comment about her couldn't be more wrong! | He says the funniest things ever. Indeed, he's like a young Jared Diamond. | Very knowledgeable and is very passionate about his research. Young and energetic. Makes the topic interesting. Very entertaining and funny. Had a TERRIBLE ta currently. Sarah H is the worst anthro at ru. Hates her job and the students. very rude. | Faunal Analysis. Difficult course, but Dr. Lewis knew the material and did a good job teaching. | can't get a better professor | Nice guy, cracks jokes a lot. Exams are easy if you study and he gives out a lot of extra credit."
"Boustany, Nada","I really enjoyed her class format and teaching style! The material was pretty difficult, and her homework/exam questions could definitely get tough, but she is a very nice grader and many assignments were based on effort and not correctness. Overall, she really cares about making sure we all learn and understand the material! | Don't get yourself fooled: she expects a lot from her students. Her Optics class is known to be one of the most difficult courses in the BME curriculum. I had no idea of that and I got an A. Go to class, do the work (and work HARD), and ask questions for clarification when you need to and you'll be fine. | I'm going to guess that she is very single- had to deal with her for an 1.5 hours a week & I couldn't do it. Avoid all classes you can & pray that she does not ‘win' the senior design teaching position. Everything from her 'University of Phoenix' (no way she went to MIT) teaching methods to her dementia kissed grading scale will make you hate her. | Apparently a 93 is only a B+. She gave us extra work because she thought it was a 2 credit class when in fact it is a 1 credit class. Many students complained but she refused to change to the official Rutgers grading scale. | Her section of intro to bme (electrical phenomena) is the easiest section if you just go over the homework questions several times and have a firm understanding of circuits | She's great! Her lectures are clear and easy to understand (the material is a bit difficult though). She explains things throughly and shows plenty of slides and things as visuals. What a relief after Dr. Bouzit. | One of the best professors teaching optics material at Rutgers. HW problems depending. material extremely useful for work. From MIT and thinks students at Rutgers are at that level. you can be if you take good notes, do the HW and ask her lots of questions. worth taking the course. | She is very nice and helpful. Also very understanding. Although at first she came off a little harsh. She may teach tough stuff, but the exam material won't have stuff that is too hard. | She expects us to know stuff for intro to BME way beyond our physics and calc background. Lectures are very confusing, homework in impossible, her portion of the course is designed to make you fail. She says first order diff eqs are high school material"
"Freeman, Joseph","Dr Freeman teaches biomechanics and leads a senior design group as well. From experience, he is very lazy and does not respond to emails or requests in a timely manner at all. Try to take another professor who cares more about students and gives more of an effort to help his students. | I took System's Physiology with him over the summer and initially he seemed like a pretty chill professor. Attendance is 10% of the garde but he didn't care if you showed up every single time. In fact he let us out 20-55 mins out most classes. However he's super lazy. He probably uses old exams and most of the material on it was not taught or hard! | Had him for Biomechanics, the lectures were awful, it was impossible to follow. All of the other students I've spoken to have said the same."
"Hara, Masanori","Take good class notes and revisit those notes again and again. If you go to study group and do the practice problems over and over again, there is no reason why you should not pass. All the formulas written on the board in class appear on the exam so put them on your formula sheet | Thermo is an overall fair class. He gives you weekly quizzes and there are four exams, each worth 20%. Lectures are full of derivations, but he tests you on actual computational problems. I recommend just doing the suggested problems and joining a study group. | Easy professor! Need roughly an 80 to get an A. Quizzes and Exams are easy. You have 4 exams and quizzes (10 total) with each exam worth 20% of your overall grade , and each quiz worth 2%. He lets you make a formula sheet, which I personally think makes the class a little too easy. Would take again. | Easy class but also learnt a lot. He taught the very basics and they are really useful for understanding the fundamentals. He is strict and somewhat interesting personally. | Very good professor. He's strict and hard, but he needs to be for a course that prepares you for the rest of your major. Go to his office hours and do the homework he assigns, even though it's ungraded the test questions are very similar. | Very inspiring Professor, he not only covers exam material but he give corresponding real world examples. He wants to make sure everyone learns the material inside out and goes the extra mile to explain it. I learned more from him than I did in analysis. I feel prepared to move forward. Just make sure to do ALL assigned problems for exams. | Terrible professor and hard to understand. The lectures are basically just equation deriving; he does almost no examples in class and expects you to know how to the suggested problems after class. Overall pointless class; didn't really learn anything even though I did well. | Very hard prof, uses most of lecture time to do derivations and does example problems rarely, if at all. Exams are tough, make sure you are on top of the material bc it's very difficult to catch up. If you don't understand something in class, ask right away. Unannounced quizzed once a week. MAKE SURE YOU KEEP UP IN CLASS - can't stress this enough. | Not that great of a professor. Spent 80% of lectures doing formula derivations, 15% administering quizzes, and 5% actually doing problems. Tough at first, but he lightens up and makes Thermo a bit easier later. He up curves if the average is too high. Gives unannounced quizzes either at the end or beginning of class. Nice curve - my ~72 was a B. | He is great. The class is challeging but his lecture makes it so much clear. As long as you do ""suggested problems"" and study, you will get good grades. Attendance is not mandatory but there is a quiz every now and then, which can be tough if you are not pepared. | man this guy really is strange in teaching. he uses a different book than the one the assigned to us. I studied my a$ off for the final and bombed it. Half the stuff on the exam I don't even know the taught it even though I never missed a lecture. | This guy is horrible don't waste your time with him none of the stuff he talks about is in the book he can't teach at all the stuff he talks about is all deriving equations and is really confusing. He takes off for spelling errors and takes off points even if you have the correct answer but it's not worded exactly like it is in the notes. | Great Professor. He is very good teacher. Go to his office hours, and pay attention to his lecture. Don't buy the textbook. No HW, but you must do a term paper which is very simple. One of the best in the engineering department | you know he's not the worst"
"Neimark, Alexander","Overall a nice guy who lays things out clearly. Despite being asynchronous, you do have two group projects that require outside of class communications (our class only had to do the first because of technical issues) but overall a good experience. Tests are open note, and papers are easy and simple. He's not trying to make your life harder. | The assignments pertain to the collective bargaining contracts between player unions & management. Youll have two group projects throughout the semester as well as series of journal questions. Exams are t/f m/c with essay, not the hardest but if you dont have a foundational understanding of professional sports you may struggle in this class."
"Wang, Hao","Don't take with this prof. He's a nice man, but not a great teacher. Makes you stand up and listen to him ramble for 30 min at the beginning of every class. Quizzes are impossible and graded super harshly. The lab reports themselves aren't too bad, they're the only thing that saved my grade. Good luck. | Overall nice person but horrible lecturer. Exams are tough so be ready to study. Class is doable but if you put in the work. | Dr. Wang was very knowledgeable about the subject of Pavement. However, it was a challenge for him to expand on practical experiences. A lot of work in this class. His homeworks were lengthly and sufficient time was often not given. His take home midterm took over my entire weekend. His project was only part that I really enjoyed about the class. | He is confused, mumbles a lot,talks too much about certain topics in class. He picks on students and is not a good not a good adviser. I would not recommend to a PhD. with him. | Hard to understand & he mumbles. But exams aren't too bad. Except the final, which was brutal. | Very helpful if you have questions. Attendance is taken sporadically. He goes over examples in class that are helpful for the homework and exam and can't be found online. The homework is graded and worth a good amount. | Prof Wang was helpful and welcomed students to ask questions after class"
"Gucunski, Nenad","gave 7 hw which none of the questions were close to what we saw on the exam. two computer assignments he failed to solve them in class but asked us to do them. refused to give solutions to sample exams so they were useless. Boringest lecturer I've ever seen. lack of communication through emails ,announcements .He just does not care. hard exams | This professor clearly cares more about his research than devoting time and interest to teaching. I didnt feel engaged in class to ask questions because he would not work out a problem for us and he did not generate interest. The sample exams are riddled with mistakes and his solutions don't follow his own material. Reach out to TA's , they'll help | Bad lecturer, don't bother learning the textbook material. Recycles his exam material from previous years, so just learn how to do all the types of problems from the old exams. Luckily, he gives you previous exams to study from. He doesn't grade any hw assignments himself, so you'll have to argue with his graders if you find any discrepancies. | Tough prof but learned a lot from this class. Would recommend if you're actually serious about the field. Super smart guy you can learn a lot from | The lecture is pointless to go to. I never got anything out of it. He gives you sample problems/exams before the midterm and final which are similar to the real thing. Make sure you do the homework since it is a decent portion of the grade | tough class but if you show you care about the material and show that you're working hard to do well, you'll get lots of help from this prof. really nice and helpful guy if you don't bullsht the class | where to begin. the class avg for the mid term was a 42. He doesnt teach what is on the tests, he didnt show up to like 5 classes. And the kicker is he is the only one who teaches the class. If you can pass this class you deserve to be called an engineer. My advise, dont bother showing up to the class, you will end up getting the same grade anyway | This guy is terrible. He read directly from the slides in a monotone broken english. He never actually did a full example for us. The numbers in the ppt examples were never right and he refused to work out a problem for us to prep for the final-said it was better to do it ourself. Ignore the people who like him, this class is a waste of my tuition | He only come to the class half of the time, and when he does show up he is useless. On the first day he told us to not takes notes because the power points can be printed out online. Study the midterms he posts online. I stopped showing up to the class after 4 weeks. | Just as everyone says, just rushes through the slides (if he's there that day). Doesn't really go over examples making the homework a lot harder. Not looking forward to the first midterm... | Goes over the basics of the subject in each class. Pretty much sticks to the book and relevant equations. Will go into more detail if YOU push him to go there, and you will need it because his exams go farther than the standard homework, typically laying multiple theories on top of each other. | The secret to passing this man's class is......First study the mid-term examples he gives you on his website. The final is NOT hard like these people say but uou must do them without previous done out work (leave yourself a week for this.) Otherwise he was a good guy as long as you know your stuff. Homework and computer assigns boost your grade. | This guy is hard!! He really doesnt cover what is on the exam, you will have to dig deep into the book, and the 100+ slides for each class to find an example problem that's remotely similar. The only reason this guy is still a prof is because he is the Civil Department Director. | He sucks | yay! | hard class-but i had to take it. not as bad as the reviews say--- geez some people are critical! smart prof...overall nice guy | zeee ****... for some reason he mentioned the word ""probe"" a lot haha... overall he sucks, he just does powerpoints and uses his laser pointer last semester's avg. for the midterm was 43 and he thought it was our fault, the nerve of that character! | Most boring professor alive. I hope you like slide shows because you'll see +500,000 slides/lecture. Skip the second lecture, he shows a bunch of pictures of rocks. | sucks, terrible, and boring. unfortunate to have him only soil prof at rutgers | No Comments | The fall of the iron curtain, was not as devastating as this class is for students at Rutgers. I have never taken a class where the average was a 43, and the professors first comments were 'Does someone care to articulate what is going on here?' I hope you slip and fall gooch! | Spends too much time on integrals and theory and not enough time on the applications and mechanics. Class is boring but the topic is not difficult. Tests are straight forward. Do the homework yourself or you'll be lost. | such a hard class but finding much help from prof...prob one of the better prof to have for such a class | Alkie! | No Comments | makes a hard class more interesting. good teacher, caring and smart. | Very helpful and intelligent. Difficult course but worth taking. | Hard to understand. Could not give a dam and it shows. | Hes so unwilling to help students. Just a complete ****"
"Christoforou, Chris","He was okay, and this class wasn't terrible, but Dr. Caldiero was kind of a tough grader and constantly canceled class, so it was tough to gauge his standards. The assignments were not hard, but the grading criteria was not clear because he did not edit any of the generic rubrics to fit the class. His expectations were just a bit too high at times. | Great professor, taught me everything I know about PR. Clear, concise, to the point and grades fairly. I would take this professor again no questions! | HIS CLASS IS AMAZING. I would take his class even if he taught astrophysics! Relaxed, easygoing, and fun. Always entertaining and funny. Made a late night trip to Cook worthwhile. His lectures were clear and he really prepared the class for the test. A doctoral student understands college. interesting class too-makes comm seems like less of a joke. | He's a great teacher, very personable, and I feel that he's pretty lax with grading papers. You'll love every minute in his class; his lectures are organized and concise. And he's not too bad to look at either ;) | took this class during the summer and was considering taking liberman but because of my schedule i had caldiero. and my goodness i'm so glad i did. if you take this over the summer, you'll learn everything you need to know AND you'll leave like 2 hours earlier than scheduled. he makes sure you don't go through unimportant details. MUCH RECOMMENDED | Great teacher who focused on only the important aspects of the book. Attend the lectures and it's an easy A. He relates pretty well with the students, and his tests are pretty easy. | He kept the material simple and focoused only on what was important for further knowledge in the PR field. Most of the class was papers and he would collect papers before grading to proof read then allow to students to make correction then hand in for grading. How many professors do that? | That other person doesn't know what he/she is saying. Hot or not (hot), Chris is a great teacher, down to earth guy, and someone you learn a lot from. Take any class he teaches. | First of all, Chris Caldiero doesn't desirve that hottie sign next to his name. I was kindof annoyed by him and his crush on Jen Aniston. I missed about 5 lectures, and was 15 mins late to the ones I attended. Didn't read book, and got a B+. 2 bs papers, 4 non cum. tests. Annoying but not a bad guy. | Even thought I had this class 8th period, and was tired at times, I always looked forward to it because he made the class so interesting and fun! Read the book and study ur notes 2 days before the exams and you'll get an A.. that's how I earned it. | Great teacher, lectures are simple even a brain dead student could understand them. no tricks with grading and gives opportunities for x-tra credit through semester so attend class or you will miss them.....he wants all too succeed and you can tell that in the way he engages each student. | He was very interesting, I really enjoyed his lectures, when I went. He's really lenient with grading papers. I wound up with a b, but if you went to every class you would probably get an a. | one of the easiest teachers i've ever had. really clear on everything and makes class fun. he makes enough jokes to keep you awake and actually lectures on eveything he tests you on. go to class.. ace the class. not to mention how nice he is to look at | He is a great teacher that makes the class fun..I had him on 8th period after a long day but I always enjoy his lectures...I will definitly take other classes with him...;) | wow.. hes wonderful.. very good class | Great teacher. Makes class fun. Not too hard. | Ehhhh. Not a great class at all. Teaches you stuff that is commonsense. Don't really know why everyone says such great things. Easy, yes, but he thinks too highly of himself and it is very boring at times. Try to take someone else | I think that this guy is the hottest teacher in SCILS! I'd take him....and I'd take his class too. | Very easy class. Grades papers really easily. Rarely went to class, except to hand in papers, and I got a B. If I went I would have gotten an A. Very clear, and willing to help as well. Didnt get to know him too well, but he seems cool | really good | The nicest guy ever...wish I could take this class again!!!! | Did a great job with what could have been a very boring class. Made the information relevant and he'e such cutie too! | No Comments | this was my favorite class. i had this class on another campus til 9 pm and i actually didnt mind making the trip. he keeps it interesting and relevant to student lives. not to mention, it is incredibly easy if u go to class and skim the book. take this | Test were easy as hell material came sraight from the book so as long as u read or come to class you ll be fine. If you do BOTH youll prob get an A. he is kinda cute n a grown man way. | Lectures were not interesting, and included a lot of gerneral broad information. Lacked content in lectures and materials presented, I found my interest level in the course very low. | What a class...and what a guy! Very cute too ! | Chris Caldiero was my TA for Intro to Comm and he was the best TA ive ever had.. cant wait to take his class in the fall!"
"Guo, Qizhong","I don't recommend it. His style of teaching is very chaotic and disorganized. I felt that his preparation for the lectures was minimal. His knowledge of the subject is very deep, but his ability to teach it or convey the information leaves a lot to be desired. Half the time was spent going through last week's homework, and 1/4 was new material. | Dr. Guo is very knowledgeable about the subject material of Coastal Engineering. However, his lectures he confused himself. His class involved too much theory and not enough practical experiences. He brought in a practical Coastal Engineer to teach the class, and I give him a lot of credit for that. Fair grader, and exams are like the homeworks. | Outstanding guy. Will go out of his way to make sure you understand the material. Do the homework and participate in class. You won't regret it. I promise. Looking forward to this Design Project | Fluid Mechanics. Professor Guo is a tremendous teacher! He does not want you to fail and will help you understand the material to pass the course. Make sure to keep on track with the homework. They help a lot in preparation for the exams. Sit closer to the front because his accent may be unclear at times. | Great guy. Always there to help both after class and in his office. His exams are similar to his homework; no curve balls. Subject can be difficult but he did an amazing job at simplifying it. Truly, one of Rutgers best Professors there ever will be. | Just sit up front because sometimes his accent and handwriting can be hard to understand. Make sure you do the homework since the exams are practically identical to the homework. | Fluid mechanics is a complicated subject and the textbook used for this course is almost useless. Dr Guo makes it seem so easy. Just go to class and copy down everything he writes on the board. He is also very helpful during office hours and answers emails quickly. The Bernoulli equation may seem complicating at first but with practice it gets easy | Prof. Guo is a nice guy and a very good instructor. Show up to class and write down his examples, and you'll be fine. The class is new material, but Prof. Guo knows how to teach you. | He is def one of the best if not the best engineering professor. His biggest downside is his accent but other than that he's mad helpful and his exams are real similar to the hw. Guos the man! | I don't understand why he only has a average rating. Yes he has an accent which can effect his clarity but as long as you do the homework, you will do well. He is helpful and defineately one of the better professors in the department. | A great professor, but not a very easy class.Tests are like the homework, so do the homework.Go to the office hours.Overall a Nice Guys, usually pass majority of the class. Does not give D, its a C or F.If ur are closer to passing u will get a C.Test are doable and easy, but u have to do the homework for that. First test av. 82 out 100. only 2 test | Totally unprofessional.He has *laughed* at students' failures and makes an effort to humiliate some students. He plays favorites and favors Chinese students. | Best engineering professor I've had so far. Homework is great prep for exams. He teaches well, and he is very willing to help students. He's cheerful, interesting, and obviously loves teaching. | Really nice guy. Makes things easy for you. Exams are very straight foward and homework is not too bad. Has a sense of humor too | Issa vohtex <O>, Pi on thanksgiving... Good times | Gammer...nough said. | His knowledge of the subject matter is somewhat questionable. Cannot even solve problems that HE makes up. | Go to class only if u want to sleep...he mumbles alot...talks with eyes closed and writes less...haha | No Comments | Fruid Fro | Very difficult to understand. I heard he got his tenure, but not sure why Rutgers gave it to him. Oh well, unlucky for you undergrads....ha ha ha | No Comments | Great guy - extremely helpful. Needs to learn English sometime soon."
"Lifrieri, Joseph","Dr Freeman teaches biomechanics and leads a senior design group as well. From experience, he is very lazy and does not respond to emails or requests in a timely manner at all. Try to take another professor who cares more about students and gives more of an effort to help his students. | I took System's Physiology with him over the summer and initially he seemed like a pretty chill professor. Attendance is 10% of the garde but he didn't care if you showed up every single time. In fact he let us out 20-55 mins out most classes. However he's super lazy. He probably uses old exams and most of the material on it was not taught or hard! | Had him for Biomechanics, the lectures were awful, it was impossible to follow. All of the other students I've spoken to have said the same."
"Kliger, Howard","First day of the semester and he doesn't even know what Canvas is. I'm sorry but with all due respect: THANK U, NEXT. I'll go take this class with someone else. | it is a hard class, most of grade is based off of two extremely hard take home exams that take 40-50 hours each. everything on exams is covered in class, take notes and you can definitely do well, i got above a 90. Ignore the bad comments, he is a GREAT professor, does a PHENOMENAL job teaching material, and is an AWESOME dude. Favorite professor. | His lectures are very clear and straightforward. The exams are 4 or 5 design problems that take at least 20 or more hours to complete. But you will learn! I ended up with a C+ and worked hard for it. | Kliger is a really good teacher. Attendance is not exactly mandatory but if you don't go to class you will not do well. Exams make you think but by the end of the class, you'll have a really good grasp of the material. Kliger can be extremely rude at times. He does not hesitate to embarrass people. | Professor Kliger is probably my favorite professor to date. Im in his solids class now, yes he gives a lot of homework, yes the exams are hard, but if you pay attention and go to class and take notes the answers are all in there. If you dont show to class you will fail, you must go. He is not easy at all but he is very good at teaching the material | Professor Kliger is a very nice guy as a person but he gives two REALLY HARD take home tests and a lot of homework. If you come to class and take good notes you can do well on his tests. Don't plan on taking any other classes simultaneously- this class will take up all youe free time. | Prof. Kilger knows what he's talking about. His take home exams are not impossible, I did fine, and learned something ihe process. But, I also was at every class taking notes when he showed us how to solve the problems. I suggest going to class and writing everything he writes. He's a good professor and wants you to learn. | Ignore the good ratings, those are the people who kissed up to him, yes he is a good prof. but his philosophy of examination is gonna set you up for failure, my friend took this same class with another prof and got a A. Avoid Kilger not as a person but as a teacher. | aviod this teacher at all cost, he makes his take home exams in a way so most will fail. do not think just because they are take home exams that you will do well, it is not from the book and he grades very very intensively, rutgers need to step in and review his ways of examining students, stay away from this guy | yes, he tells lame jokes. yes, he goes over the time limit. yes, his exams are TOUGH. he goes OUT OF HIS WAY to make sure you learn, offering time outside class to make sure you understand the material. offers invaluable help for his take-home exams, as well. show up for class, do the homework, ask questions, and you'll do well in his class. | Pro: Very Smart, Speaks clear english, Probably only professor, I know who works his ass off to teach you. SO Learn. Con: Overtime, Hardest(F**ing) exam ever took, but if you know and pay attention.its all good. ""ASK Question"". It does take 50 hours to complete the exam. Well its a very long exam. 30-40 pages for answer. G.LUC | I like this guy. He's very nice, although his jokes are kinda lame. Runs overtime but no one sleeps. HW is due EVERY class, not just once a week like most classes. HW is graded kinda harsh (he didn't grade it), but overall it's doable. Take him if you can. | Make no mistake, this class is difficult. If you are a CE, Kliger will teach you what you need to know, and he does it well. If your not a CE even he will tell you you shouldnt take this course. I liked his teaching, and I learned a lot, non-CEs didnt fair so well. | difficult HW, but 2 take home exams. i was supposed to get an A in the class (gave me a B) but after email correspondence he said ""after 4 years, the difference between an A and a B is minimal, if that"" jokes are funny in a very primitive, immature kind of way; goes OverTime in his lectures | Material was actually slightly interesting, and it would have been a good class if professor kliger wasn't the worst professor ever. Bad jokes, runs OVERTIME on a 3 and a half hour long class, ridiculous grading -- Rutgers needs to step in and take action | Possibly the worst professor I have ever had. Only teaches in the summer, so avoid him at all costs. Take home exams take over 50 hours each to complete. He is also very unprofessional and graded harshly."
"Mandayam, Narayan","Not clear. Not helpful. | One of the best professors at RU. Very helpful. Easy exams. | Best Professor @ Rutgers...if you dont interact with him, you are definitely missing out on a lot! | Amazing teaching skills. But he must come down to the level of all the students in the class rather than expecting the students to know whatever he is teaching."
"Frenkiel, Richard","Lectures for hours doing extremely complex math in an intelligible way with perfect accuracy without ever using notes or a book. Absolute genius. Scary intelligence. Dont be intimidated to ask him for help though - hes a really nice guy who can figure out how to make you understand literally anything. | The best teacher I ever had. Excellent teaching, does not have his notes writes everything from his mind. Very, very smart! | Cool! Excellent teaching! Professor #1 | haha, funny... after failing the qualifying, you come here to rate him bad to release your frustration. even a DAD is commenting on his teaching! What a hell. | Hottest professor ever in many ways. When it comes to lecture, he's THE GOD. THE GOD, period. He's lookin gorgeous too! | He is the best I have ever had either in US or in my country. Absolutely difficult class but extremely helpful and clear. If you want to suffer and learn the greatest deal in your life. Take him. Outside the class, it's hard to find him just like a ghost. | The best professor I have had in either grad or undergrad classes. Can and will break down complex ideas. If you are just not getting something he will present it from a different angle. | This guy is a teacher that makes you feel like you know your stuff when he teaches it just make sure to review after class. Looks like Daniel Craig 007. Likes to rush out of lecture but EXTREMELY helpful during recitations. Nearly a ghost the rest of the time, havent seen him anywhere other than class. Class is hard unless you have a lot of math"
"Raychaudhuri, Dipankar","I took Dr. Dipankar's class online for my MBA Leadership. He is a VERY heavy lecturer and had my class watch over an hour an a half of lectures outside of class on top of weekly articles we had to read + write up. He greatly values participation in class and WILL cold-call on you. He had a midterm and a final online with Lockdown Browser (Webcam). | I was an undecided major until I took his class. Glad, I decided to take marketing. I met with him multiple times outside the classroom and he really helped me figure out what I was interested in. Great class! | Listen, I am not sure what everyone else is saying but his class although was not terrible and I did not get a bad grade he is overall a mean person and belittles his students. Even though we are all adults and some of us are graduating he just makes you feel like a toddler. Would not recommend as a teacher | This was one of my favorite classes. He makes the class interesting and applicable. | This was my second class with him. He cares about the students and asks for regular feedback about the class. He makes sure that students clearly understand the concepts. Sometimes, the class got a little slow but his examples are pretty engaging and relevant. | I took this class over the summer. This is my second class with him and his lectures are always great. I like how he explain concepts using examples that are relevant and current. | I took this course over the summer and I really liked the way the class was laid out. His lectures were great and I learned a lot about digital marketing. The simulation was a little difficult in the beginning but he spent extra time explaining it. | Dr. Rai is an excellent professor at Le Moyne College. His marketing class is always engaging, and he applies marketing concepts to the real world. Please be advised that participation matters and group projects are graded based on everyone's contributions, so choose your groups wisely! Overall, Dr. Rai taught his marketing class effectively. | Great class! | Prof Rai is a really nice guy. The tests are easy and so is the homework. The main thing in the class is participation. If you don't participate or show up, it will affect your grade. | He teaches right from the book Quizzes are right from the book The labs were tricky and if you missed one or two questions you get a bad grade The writing assignments were graded fairly I took this during the Summer so there were 3 lectures, 3 writing assignments, 3 labs and 1 quiz a week. Some weeks there were 6 hours of lectures. | He makes you work for every single point and it is a pain. You have to present every few classes which is not fun if you're not a good public speaker. The lectures are subpar. I would take a different professor is possible. | I had huge expectations from this course and I was let down. Not at all impressed. | He's a really nice guy, sometimes hard to understand. He really likes to get off topic about things and it can get a little boring, but the exams aren't too bad and you can retake them which is a plus. | I expect a professor to be expert in his/her field. Sadly Dipankar lacks the expertise to be teaching this subject. Also he just reads stuff off of the slides and books | Very nice guy, but this rating isn't based on personality. Purely teaching wise, it's like he doesn't know what he's talking about, purely reading from a book/the text and powerpoints which he copied it from. He talks as if he's reading it for the first time, and the whole class is simply obvious things he's explaining. | Great guy and great professor. He is very enthusiastic about what he does, so it makes class way more enjoyable. Lecture material is fascinating and he assigns little amounts of homework. | Prof Rai is a good guy. However it seems he holds himself back teaching a MKT301 course. For better or for worse, he doesn't go deep into the topics. It seems like we were learning the same things all semester and it got pretty boring. It is easy to get a good grade though, extra credit and make up exams are a thing. | Made the class enjoyable, there were 3 exams throughout the semester and they were all online. If the class didn't perform well on the exams we would allows to complete extra credit assignments! | This guy is really the best. You would be dumb to not take him. You get a new skips, and after that it barely effects your grade. One test (with the option to retake it regardless of grade) and a take home final. Very considerate and wants you to do well. Best professor ever!!!! Take him if given the chance. Very smart and really cool guy. | He does not have deep knowledge of the subject. It is very easy to confuse him if you ask for detailed explanation of some concept. He downloads his material from the internet and uses other professors materials. | At first he seems a little standoffish but he really does care for his students. The lectures were a bit boring at times but overall the class wasn't too hard at all; we were graded on 3 tests, online assignments, and a couple presentations, so there were plenty of chances to redeem yourself if you did bad on an exam or missed a presentation. | Rai is so nice and doesn't rush the material. He makes sure every student in class understands the concepts before moving onto the next topic. He's very patient and he gives a clear understanding during review as to what will be on the test. He allows a retake on a test and extra credit after every test as well. Overall, great professor, very kind. | Class is lecture and take notes (or don't) style. There are about 5 presentations where your group gets an article (not that long) to read and presents on it. Not too bad. The grade mainly is based off of 3 tests. If you put in some good study sessions before the tests, you should get a good grade. There was extra credit after tests too. | This class was very different than the others I took. Make sure you attend every day because we learnt coding everyday. I missed two classes and felt lost. He was really helpful and went over everything I missed. Its a great class to learn R. | Took his Marketing Analytics class and was far from impressed. He barely knows what he's talking about as he gets his lessons off of the internet, and is also an extremely difficult grader that gave vague instructions on his exams. If you do not need this class, do not take it. | Great teacher and wants everyone to do well. The tests are online and he gives you plenty of time to prepare for them. Group discussions are easy and he always gives extra credit if the class doesn't do well on tests. | Knows a lot about marketing strategies. Class has interesting examples but relies heavily on powerpoints. Test questions are literally given to you before the exam (same exact questions). Group lectures on WSJ occasionally but group questions are super easy-presentations about 2 minutes with your group members. Easy A, but class seems like its 4eve | I really liked the dynamics in this class. Learned a lot about marketing. | Great class, very organized and makes the lectures interesting! | He has made many female students uncomfortable with his stare | Professor Rai is a great professor. Marketing is my major and I am glad this class was able to make me feel even better about my major decision. He is clear, organized, doesn't issue much homework, and is more than happy to offer help when needed. If you show up, participate, and study for tests, it should be an Easy A. He gives extra credit also | Really interesting class in terms of dynamic. It was unorganized and all over the place, but the content was relevant and he lectured well. Overall great guy. Never opened the textbook | Best Teacher! Highly recommned | AMAZING professor! Take his class, you will learn a lot. on a side note his style is on point! | This is DIpanakr's first year teaching at Le Moyne and he is already by far the the best professor at the business school. He is great at teaching the material and making it relevant to real life situations. Most of all, he is always available after class to help students! I highly recommend taking him! You won't be disappointed!!"
"Beskin, Anna","As long as you show up and do the little HW given you'll do good. | You literally cannot understand a word she says. If you ask a question, she stares blankly, says ""good question"" and moves on. It is impossible to pay attention because you can't be totally sure of what she's talking about. AVOID AT ALL COSTS | Try not to take Ed Psych with Professor Lee. While she is a very nice lady, she does not speak or read English at an acceptable collegiate level. As a result, her test directions are frequently unclear and her handouts and assignments are almost always grammatically incorrect. I'm sure she would be much less confusing if her English was better. | Professor Lee speaks broken English. She is fighting a language barrier that restricts her from communicating easily with her students. This is a problem because it is consistently difficult to understand what she is saying. In addition, she arrives late to every class, her handouts are difficult to understand, and her lectures are uninspiring."
"Mozael, Mustafa","Mustafa was an amazing TA. The class was alright but his explanations were awesome! He was always available for questions after class and responded to me right away! I highly reccomend!! | He's actually really a great TA, someone else said this but I think he is kinda hot hahaha! Take him and you'll get distracted all the time!! | Gave lot of pop quizzes. Kept us on our toes and failed us all first lab, a lot of kids dropped. But he was easy after that, also I think he was really nice about grading cause he gave sooo much extra credit and let us work in groups of 4-5 people for labs and let us leave early if we wanted to. Good guy! | ya dat jaffry be low key starring into space with his thoughts. He grade really nice though. this class a little hard. find friends who got yo back. | Ever so often, perhaps once in a blue moon, a harmonic convergence will occur. And upon a faithful rock in Bethlehem, a Mustafa was born! He wrought upon his Chem Lab class a mighty grading fist, but with a just hand! ""You get what you get and no retakes!"" he would say with a chuckle! Would definitely take again, I'm so happy I passed with a C! | He was my TA for chemistry lab and he really explained the concepts well and I really enjoyed this class. If he is available as a TA please pick him!"
"Pinchiaroli, Michael","He's such an amazing professor. I had him for College Writing and he made that class calm for me. He's very accessible outside of class, just email him and he will answer. Tells jokes and lets us watch videos before he starts his lecture. 10/10 recommend | An incredibly fun, and understanding professor, who also knows how to motivate his students to succeed in his class. He is always available during office hours if you need help with the papers, and he is flexible with due dates if you provide a reason. He genuinely cares about helping you succeed and is very approachable. Would highly recommend. | The most chill person you will EVER meet. I still talk with him to this day. Literally my favorite professor. He has leniency with everyone, is super flexible, and insanely funny and charismatic. Wish I had him for all of my courses. I learned so much with him and even got to present my poster at URWC because of him. DEFINITELY take him | Oh my gosh, where do I even start? Professor Monescalchi is the absolute best professor I have ever had. Taking this course with him was the best decision I have ever made. Generous, kind, funny, and truly cares about his students and that they understand what they are learning! You have to put in the work for sure but TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM! | He is an amazing teacher I've ever had! English is my worse subject, I was never excited to take an English course, but he made it very easy! If I were able to take his class again I would! Plus, he cancels class here and there sometimes! TAKE HIM! | To simply put it, he is the best professor at this university. I am not an english/arts person, but he really made the content enjoyable and put time to make sure everyone understood what to do on the big projects. He always makes time outside of class if you need him. If you have the opportunity to take him, do it! | One of if not the best professor I've had. THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS, but Monescalchi made it as painless and fun as possible. Extremely accessible outside of class, generous grader, and take shis time to make sure you understand what is expected of you. He definitely cares and wants to see his students pass. Would only take if he is teaching it. | Best professor ever!! He likes to talk & engage with his students and he has zoom office hours if you need extra help on assignments. Very helpful & gives great feedback. Super chill guy, would def recommend him. | If you have a chance to take a class with him, DO IT. He is the most caring professor I've ever had, and he genuinely wants and helps you to get a good grade. | This man knows how to teach. He made Research in Dis enjoyable for me and helped me write a paper about a topic that I was truly passionate about. He will help you to the best of his ability if you make an effort to reach out to him. | Mr. Mike is the best professor I've had because he's so understanding and relates to his students. Expos is known to be difficult due to the number of essays in such a short period of time, but he made the class very enjoyable and easy. When it came down to writing essays, I felt very prepared because all the homework he gives us wasn't busy work. | The best expos professor at Rutgers. He cares about every single student and truly wants you to succeed. I looked forward to this class every week. Take advantage of his office hours and put in some effort and you will get an A. | Best expos professor at Rutgers. Hands down. | Incredible professor. If you have the option to take him, do so, you will not regret it. Not only is he extremely friendly, he is a great teacher who clearly cares about not only helping his students do well, but cares about the students themselves. The workload for 201 (research in the disciplines) is pretty hefty, but he makes the class bearable. | He is my favorite Professor at Rutgers. Hands down. I'm an international student so my confidence in my English writing skills wasn't the best coming in,, but he gives you so much feedback and really cares about you. Helped me improve my writing so much that I now desire to publish my final research paper from that class. Definitely take him! | Best professor I've had at Rutgers so far! He's hilarious, chill, and direct. If you weren't the best at writing in HS and think you shouldn't take Expos 103, I can GUARANTEE (as long as you go to OH) that Michael will make you an amazing writer. His feedback is amazing and without it, I would not have ended the class with an A. I'd take him again. | Great professor! This class consists of two essays and one research paper. He dropped the lowest grade for the essays and allowed us to meet with him before our submissions. Please go to office hours!! He would look over your paper and give you feedback. (He told me I was getting As before I finished the papers.) He is also very chill and funny. | I've had Professor Monescalchi three times and he's awesome. Super helpful and enthusiastic professor. | Literally the most amazing professor I have ever had. His feedback was the only reason I ended the class with an A. There was visible improvement in my work between the total of 4 papers. Take expos with him!! | Expos is hard. He makes it fun. Very funny, engaging, and caring. Take him if you can. | one of my favorite professors ever! he cares so much about his students and is so chill but doesn't let his students take advantage of that. he is always around for office hours and wants to push them to be better writers and analytical thinkers definitely recommend his RID class | Professor Monescalchi is a great guy and makes it very easy to pass his class. He encourages everyone to speak at least once during lectures and you get credit for attending/speaking. He is really funny and is reasonable with the assigned readings. He is very helpful when you go to office hours. | Michael is one of the best writing professors at Rutgers. He made my research class very enjoyable and helped me improve my writing and researching skills. He made me grow as a writer. Michael provided me with great feedback on my paper and always responded to questions effectively inside and out of class. I highly recommend taking a class with him | I had Prof. M during the summer for the EOF expos. He is super outgoing and welcoming. He makes the class really interesting and gives really good feedback. I'd like to note he loves participation and you really do become a better writer as a result of his feedback. I left the class feeling 10x a better writer. I definitely recc. for any RU class | One of the best professors to have at Rutgers. Extremely intelligent guy who genuinely wants all of his students to succeed. His classes are difficult but he tells you exactly what he's looking for in a paper. He gives thoughtful, extensive feedback on your papers, which very few professors will do. Super funny and relaxed. Could not recommend more | He is the best English professor I had for writing so far. Even though his classes were kinda hard, but he explains everything clearly. | Prof. Monescalchi is one of the nicest and most caring individuals I have ever interacted with. He is always willing to help his students and allow them to grow. He provides great feedback and ensures no one does any busy work. For the first time in my life, I have enjoyed a writing class often hated due to him. Highly recommend! | Guy is amazing and extremely smart. Making Expos fun and stimulating intrinsic motivation to develop writing skills at the same time is an impressive feat. | It was for expository writing btw (the comment underneath) | I came into the class with the mindset of just getting a C in his class, but little did I know that it was possible to get an A. Throughout the whole summer I learned from my mistakes in his office hours and worked my ass off to improve my writing skills. Take MICHAEL!!!! I kid you not you will do well if you put the work ethic in bc he sees all!! | Had him for intro to poetry! He is literally the coolest freakin professor at the school. Literally the man. Just do the readings and participate at least once a class and he will continue to be the cool guy he is and if not you played yourself. Fair grader but once again only if you show and have real effort. Pop quizzes sometimes. | Good professor and overall great guy. He really wants people to participate in class to get the class moving. If no one talks, he breaks out the pop quizzes. Easy grader, not bad. Has three papers on mostly whatever you want. Very helpful outside of class as well. He wants people to have opinions on things and speak them, even if they aren't good | AMAZING professor. He's SOOO funny, relatable, and extremely helpful! Truly wants everyone to do well in the class. HIGHHHLLLYYYY recommend!!!!! | This is probably the best instructor I've had so far at Rutgers. He really encourages discussion in the classroom and wants to hear how everyone feels about the readings. The main thing he looks for is for you to participate. I definitely recommend taking this class! There were only 3 papers and less than 10 quizzes(really easy as long as you read) | Amazing professor. 3 papers in the class. grades fairly. he tells you exactly what he expects from you. encourages personal ideas. participating in class is important! | Really laid back professor. Loves when students participate. Effort goes a long way. | Michael is very passionate about his work, and you can tell by the amount of effort and enthusiasm he puts into his lectures. He is very laid back, but values participation, so show up and speak up. A few papers and pop quizzes to make sure you've read enough. Love him! | Probably the best expos professor. Gives clear feedback on papers, is easily available to meet, and is a fair grader. | I had no interest in taking this class. It was a requirement for my major and I just wanted to get it done. By the end of the semester, I enjoyed going to class every day and I firmly believe it was Michael's influence that made me want to go. Whenever I wanted help, he was there to look at my work. Never unwilling to critique my work. | For being so young mike is an amazing teacher. His teaching style is a very accessible combination of clarity and humor. You don't need to be afraid of passing expose or comp if you have him as a professor if you are struggling he is ALWAYS there to help and really cares! Plus he has cool style and a sexy beard! | Mike goes out of his way to make material understandable. He also gives great feedback on papers, and helps us brainstorm topics and evidence for prompts. Mike knows how the Expos graders think, and subsequently gives us great in-class support before we go into a draft. He makes Expos (almost) manageable- good as can be. A pretty cool guy too. | Best English professor I've ever had in my life! Very clear when he is teaching and cares for each and every student. He will make sure you become an amazing writer with his feedback! | He is very very helpful, he tells you what he wants in the essays and what not to do. He gives lots of examples that will help you improve your writing."
"Jeong, Myong-Kee",MK is a nice enough person but his teaching style often leads to confusion. Somehow things I do understand are explained in a way that confuse me and the things I don't understand are glossed over. He jumps all over the place in his notes so it's very difficult to follow along in class. The book doesn't do a great job of explaining things either.
"Gilbert, Douglas","Took him for Inequality and he was okay. He is a boring lecturer, but you understand the material if you follow along. The TA's really tried to help with the class. The 3 exams had 4 open ended questions and he didn't tell you or the TA's what they were or what sections so you have to be really prepared. The paper is easy. There was a curve! | Great prof and very knowledgeable. The only grades are two papers (5-7pgs, 3pgs), two midterms, and a final plus some clicker questions that don't count for a lot. Blair emails back quickly and is always on the Sakai chatroom. The lecture slides are posted, but he gives so much extra info in class that it's worth going. | great professor goes into depth in his lectures. if you are student that works hard and keeps up to date with material you will be fine nice man as well. | I took inequality with Professor Blair, and found some of the material to be challenging at first. The class was extremely interesting, but there was a lot of information covered. Both Professor Blair and the TA's went out of the way to ensure everyone was understanding the material. Very nice man that wants the best for his students. | I had professor Blair for Inequality. While he can be very lecture heavy and can seem to have a tough time explaining stuff sometimes, he was very willing to help any students who did not understand him the first time. Very nice guy who wants you to do well. Attendance is not mandatory but to do well it is very recommended. | Doesnt teach much and talks in circles. Pretends to be a liberal but his true views are obvious if you pay attention. Doesnt understand the millennials. | Took his class in 2008 during the crash and all the news breaking around it. Either ECON102H or 201. Was lots of fun talking to him after class about it as it was happening. If I recall correctly I think he got me onto behavioral economics. Really smart guy. | Do not take. The other students could not keep up, and he goes over one topic the entire class, and not actually teaching us, just shows us a bunch of graphs. He was helpful in trying to help you, but it did not help. Other students in my class most definitely struggled with a 60 avg for our midterm. | Tests are hard but curved. Make sure to read the textbook and review slides. stay for extra help, his class is really fast-paced and boring | Took his Choice and Strategy in Politics course. If you're a B average student who reads the material and skips a class or two throughout the entire semester you won't pass. You need to have a heavy background in game theory. Average for midterm was a 50%. The man is a genius, but he forget he's teaching students unfamiliar with the topic. | Professor Blair is a fine professor but his lectures are sometimes difficult to keep up with. You have to read the textbook before and after each lecture. There's 4 quizzes and then a final, but the quizzes do prepare you for the final. He is also willing to help you pass. | Prof Blair was alright, his class consisted of 4 quizzes and a final. Quizzes were all very tough in my opinion- even ppl who study failed (20 questions on each quiz.) Gives lots of homework that has no correlation with his quizzes. Really have to put in the effort to pass with a good grade. Blair himself is always willing to help though. | Bad professor. Lectures are not clear at all. A lot of homework that have nothing to do with the quizzes. You can study for 6 hours straight, and still fail a quiz. | quizzes are tough and you really need to study. he isn't clear sometimes but asking questions or going to his office hours/TA's office hours helps. iclicker and aplia assignments are mandatory. overall, he's okay but you really need to study | He is not a clear professor. I do not recommend taking a class with im. | He has 4 quizzes, each of which are worth 10% of your grade, instead of midterms. While it is really annoying to have a quiz every 4 to 6 weeks, it makes it so that when the final comes you are already super prepared. The quizzes were very tough tho. The class average on some of them was a 40 or less. | Quizzes are tough and rarely relate to homework, Aplia Assignments, and Lecture notes. Study the textbook and you should do fine. Professor Blair is funny and clearly knows the subject but is not clear in lecture. He is much clearer during office hours and you will have to work for an A. | Blair is an approachable professor who is more than willing to help. His HW assignments are weekly, but doable and his lectures aren't long but can be confusing at times. He gives four quizzes that really test the material so looking at the slides, taking notes, and sitting in lectures are crucial. He does give a great curve. Would recommend. | Lectures are boring and long, sometimes gives an iclicker quiz, but not many times. The textbook readings were easier to understand than the lectures, but he is very accommodating and easy to talk to. | Incredible teacher. Really knows what he's talking about, but can be dry if you're not interested in economics. Tries to take class to the next level by making real world connections and getting everyone involved. Do the homework and go to class and you'll be fine. | Blair is a wonderful person; he wants you to succeed in his class and appreciates students attending office hours. That being said, his lectures can be confusing so it is extremely IMPORTANT to do the reading and review his slides. The 4 quizzes he gives are cumulative and tough, but he gives a good curve. He was my favorite prof this semester. | Quizzes are not easy but he give generous curves. Work hard and you can get a good grade. | Blair was decent. He spent a lot of time during lecture on topics most students understood and not enough time on the trickier concepts. One of the better Micro teachers. | Horrible lecturer, mean, will kick people out of a giant lecture hall for whispering to their neighbor. This man is not afraid to call anyone out for talking or using a cell phone in class because they are causing a ""disruption"" yet that is only causing even more of a disruption. Quizzes are extremely hard and recitation doesn't help. | Blair is a funny n endearing guy but if u have a hard time comprehending economics then consider a different professor. The quizzes (we have 4 instead of 2 exams) are difficult imo because they dont match with the online hw. Probs not the best micro prof but he is rly open to helping his students n actually cares about you despite his large classes | He gives weekly homework that doesn't pertain to the quizzes. The quizzes are very tricky and the time given to take the quiz is not enough. He also gives random iclicker questions, there is no pattern of when he gives them so attendance is kind of a must if you want to get credit. The recitations are helpful but not enough for the quizzes. | He Actually thinks he's good no way he studied | He Actually thinks he's good | This micro class was extremely hard, his slides were mostly graphs and it was confusing. It felt as if the exams were on material that we never even went over. I don't recommend this class | Yes, Public Economics is hard. Yes, it's a lot of work, and you're going to have to actually read the textbook. But Professor Blair has a charmingly dry sense of humor, and despite his intimidating demeanor during the first half of the semester, he's very kind to serious students who work diligently. His curve is also extremely generous. Fear not! | He is a decent enough guy. He sees that people make an effort to try, but he just covers too much information in a semester. The final is cumulative and covers the entire textbook (25 chapters). This class is not worth it. He assigns A LOT of reading, and you need to read and understand the textbook to do well. Take an easier elective. | Took Public Economics with Blair. He's a great guy and is super nice, but his lectures and exams were extremely confusing and overwhelming. Listening to his lectures and reading his powerpoint slides will not help you much. You MUST read the textbook chapters in detail and he will test you on maybe 4-5 main topics out of a gazillion topics. | He seems not to be a baddy at all at the first sight. Then, after we have purchased the Aplia thing, he has changed. He doesn't care about students at ALL! I sent him email TWICE! I missed the quiz that worth 10% of the grade because I was sick. He didn't even reply. What an nice guy! : Don't take the course. I dropped it :D | DONT TAKE HIM. horrible lecturer, and explains things horribly. will yell at anyone with a laptop or cell phone out. Only reason to go to class is iClicker questions because you dont learn anything. Got a C+, and even that was curved. Get someone else! | Dry lecturer, can be confusing, but pretty fair professor overall. Online homework 10%, clicker questions 10%, 2 exams 20% each & cumulative final 40%. read the textbook as it is easier to understand than lectures (which I stopped attending). Exams are confusing but he makes up for it with a massive curve (77.5 was an A- for an exam) | Blair is a very caring and knowledgeable professor, however that doesn't translate into being the best teacher. The class is difficult and it takes a lot of effort, readings, and homework to keep up. Unfortunately lectures make the content even more difficult than it already. | Prof Blair is a really nice person once you get to know him but he is a terrible lecturer. His exams are very difficult and he makes microeconomics seem a lot more complex than it really is. Class is mandatory and he kicks students out frequently during the lectures. He definitely knows what he is talking about though. | His slides and explanations are really tricky, but he's nice and really cares about you succeeding if you go to him for extra help. Read the book to understand the material better. There's a lot of extra work, but it's not that difficult. Your grade is based on how you rank in class. | This guy does not know how to teach. Lectures are extremely boring. Take another professor if you actually want to learn economics and get a good grade while doing so. | This teabag doesn't prepare you at all for the exams but if you actually read the textbook on time and do all the aplia you should pull at least a B | not that good and not that bad. read book carefully and u will get good results | Stay away from this professor. Although he doesn't totally and completely suck, there are better options for professors. A lot of unnecessary work for the class, and he is not really clear at explaining himself. He relies heavily on the textbook and material is pretty hard. His class has a recitation,should take different prof without one. | Blair is a great teacher. Yes his exams are challenging and his slides can be confusing, but he is always available and willing to help. If you read the book and go to him with questions you will have no trouble in his class. Also he likes to act like he's a tough guy but he's actually a nice guy | Despite the intimidating impression he gives in lecture, he is actually a very nice and helpful professor outside of the classroom. He's very challenging and he will make you work for your A. With that said, he still does give generous curves. I recommend him if you're an econ major. If you're not, I suggest you take a different section. | he needs to understand that we were not all born knowing the material. originally an econ professor, was terrible in explaining anything. DONT TAKE. my TA saved my life and i ended up with an A. its all up to how your TA is. | Probably the worst lecturer ever. Makes things incredibly difficult to understand, and talks about nearly nothing that will be on exams. His class is literally all textbook. Don't expect study guides, example problems, or any help from Blair in getting prepared for the exams. Very condenscending and non helpful though he thinks he is. Avoid | Blair is such a nice guy, but a terrible lecturer. His exams are pretty tough too, but he gives a huge curve. Just read the textbook | I found blair very hard to follow during lectures. i actually cleared myself up while reading the book afterward. he uses the most complicated ways of explaining simple terms and ideas. i recieved a 64 52 and 53 on the final and ended up with a C. i recommend staying away from this teacher. | Put effort into Aplia homework; you need a really high percentage like 96% to get full 10 points for it. You could probably pass exams without going to lecture, but there are clicker questions. READ THE BOOK. It's pretty easy to understand. He's incredibly helpful. Use his office hours. He's a great guy..so nice. | He can be hard to follow at times and some of his lecture slides are confusing but he really makes himself available for help if you need it and offers plenty of studying resources. The textbook is available online through aplia but you can get a hardcopy if you want to. Overall nice guy, just study hard for the exams!"
"Akdogan, Enver Koray","Very condescending, makes you feel like you are never enough in an extremely rude manner. Expects us to know things we've never been introduced to and treats us with too high of expectations. Will go on 20min rants/freakouts, repeating the same thing over and over again. I would only recommend taking him to pass because his exams are take home. | So your entire grade is 3 Midterm exams (Celebration of Learnings) and homework is assigned but not graded. Honestly, a very different class than many engineering classes regarding to structure. Lectures are very abstract but interesting to say the least. Sometimes he comes off as egoist but grades in the Celebration of Learning is very fair. | Are we clear? | Hot take, did not like him. Spent so much time in class talking about random topics unrelated to the course that didnt help on exams. 3 exams all 1/3 of grade. Says ""attendance quizzes"" will affect grade, they never do (same with homeworks) even though they are ""mandatory."" Very inconsistent grading on the take-home exams (which take all wknd) | People keep saying this is mandatory attendance and homeworks, but they are wrong. They are ""mandatory"" but there is 0 repercussion or grade penalty for skipping/not doing homework. Little condescending in lecture but he has good intentions and if you put effort into the ""Celebration of Learning""s you will get an A. Just be thorough in answers. | He tells us to use the canvas ""chatroom"" to ask questions during the take home exam, yet rarely answers them. | He is IMPOSSIBLE to reach outside of class. Email him, he never responds. Good professor in class but if you need to communicate with him for any reason, even a take home exam, he will not respond at all. | He's a great lecturer, tests are take-home and pretty straightforward if you use the slides and textbook. He is very repetitive at times though and comes off as very condescending. ""Are you aware of this? You guys are engineers you should know this."" Be prepared to hear that a lot. Also random participation checks every now and then | He lectures in class and has open notes tests where all the answers can be found in his slides. highly recommend writing notes on the slides but don't be upset if you miss a class. he does pop quizzes for attendance which he uses to see if he should bump you up a grade if you're one below the next letter grade. Each exam is online and takes forever | He's an amazing professor who's very interested in student growth. He has 3 take home exams which make up your grade. His class is not that hard, just show up to class, and take some notes. Has sense of humor, and has a lot of catch phrases. Best engineering professor at Rutgers, take him. | Akdogan stands out from pretty much every professor I've ever had, for better and for worse. Grade is entirely based on 3 take home exams, which aren't too hard, but he'll still pester you to turn in your homework and attend class with threats of docking points. His passion is unmatched and he's pretty funny sometimes, so I didn't mind going. | Professor Akdogan is a really good professor. He cares more about the facts that you have learned something than just superficial test grades. He also gave us take-home exams and was happy to see that everyone did well. His only concern was if we were understanding the material and honestly we were because there was less pressure put on us. | I have seen god, and his name is Koray Akdogan. One of the best professors I've ever had. Was very practical, talked about industry applications a lot, dissected the material in a digestible way. His exams are reasonable, but you will need to make a good equation sheet for them. He is known to do take home exams, though my section didn't have one. | My favorite professor in the school of engineering by far. Extremely knowledgable about several fields, challenges students to think outside the box, and gives good advice for job searching/interviewing. Tests are very straight-forward and if you spend adequate time making your cheat sheet you should easily get a B+ or higher. | Pretty normal class. Go to lecture and pay attention even though his lectures are dry. Actually DO the homework because half of those questions are on the exam | Dr. Akdogan's a very intelligent professor who places genuine interest in the students' learning. Class moves fast, but exams are fair. Just 3 MTs and no final, and he provides study guides and lets you bring a cheat sheet. He always pushed us to think on a large scale, even though sometimes it felt like he was disappointed when we couldn't do so. | Had him for Mech Prop of Materials. Attendance sign in is required. Homework isn't graded. Test is fair with partial credit, so try to learn some of the material. He'll let you know what to study. His personality is quite arrogant, but he pushes his students to think outside the box. Would be a great lecturer if he didn't constantly belittle us. | I took his thermo class. Even if it was so hard, he was extremely helpful. He treats you as a future Engineer and he does not judge you if you ask any question. He is always there to help ! | Take this guy every chance you get. He's one of the best, if not the best, professors I have had at Rutgers. Make sure you go to every lecture because he does take attendance and will deduct points from your final grade if you miss more than 2 classes. | When I first took this class, I was scared because Dr. Akdogan really pushes people to learn the different parts of engineering. But for the exam, everyone is allowed a page of formula sheets. If you attend his review session, he will tell you what you need to know. Overall, he was a great prof who wants you to do well and if you get 50+ you pass. | This professor is the easiest professor I 've ever seen in the engineering department. No quiz, NO project, just exam. Nobody get grade below B and most of students get an A. He would post every thing in the sakai,which is so good. He deserve and get the professor of the year in the department. I so glad if I can take his other class | As stated under me, this professor is very intelligent. He really cares about every one of you and wants you to do well in the class. He makes you think in lecture so that you develop this mentality when you begin your professional career. Make sure to do the HW and show up to lecture and you should do fine in the class. | This guy is awesome, a very intelligent man. He actually wants you to do well and succeed and treats you like you're already an engineer. If you do the HW and stay on top of the class, you'll do fine. Put in a bit of extra effort, it's not hard to get an A. He clearly outlines everything about the class too. Would definitely take him again. | Awesome professor! had him for mech properties of materials. really nice! allows you to have cheat sheets and has generous curve despite the averages being in the 80s and even 90s. Assigns a lot of HW but his exams are like HW so if you do HW, you'll be fine for the 3 midterms (no final)!"
"Matthewson, Michael","Prof. Matthewson is an incredible person. I've visited him several times during the semester for office hours and he was very helpful. I'd say he is the best prof. in all of Rutgers Engineering. Hands down. | Professor Matthewson was hands-down the best professor that I ever had at Rutgers. He is quick-witted, funny, and extremely knowledgeable about many subjects. Take as many of his courses as possible, even if that means taking a graduate course as an undergrad! I can't say too many good things about this man. | Professor Matthewson is an unrivaled educator in the Materials Department. His courses are extremely challenging, but worthwhile. I had him for Physics, Strength, and Thermo and found that as the coursework became more and more complicated, his understanding of the material began to shine through. A great teacher and a fantastic fellow! | Strengths of Materials - Best teacher in the major. Incredibly helpful. Homework is not too bad, can be slightly harder than most homework but it not only makes sense but is useful. Always willing to help you too. Great teacher. Class is a bit tough but its worth it. | Professor Matthewson, before all other engineering professors, should be rated on this website. He is the most funny/interesting, insightful, and thought provoking professor I have ever had at Rutgers University. He also has a great accent that makes you want to listen, even when material gets dry. Also, he talks about tea time. God bless MJM."
"Saxena, Lakshmendra","Definitely the best individual if you wanna learn a lot and apply in your work, believing in experiential learning with flexibilities! | I didn't know YorkU actually had good profs! He was the best EECS prof I ever had. Very good lectures, reasonable labs, midterm, and exam. He actually cares about you learning the content and he even gave us a solid and detailed outline of what to expect on the exam. You have to put in the work but it definitely pays off. Take it with him! | The lectures were surprisingly cool considering the class is mostly common knowledge on communication. A lot of in class activities, so if you're introverted this should help you come out of your shell (it definitely helped me). Marking on assignments is pretty clear and he marks super fairly! Final quiz was super long, but doable. Take it with him | Really great prof that cares about his students! He's not conventional ""read-off-the-slides"" but uses his personal stories to explain the material. Be prepared to work in groups even if you are an introvert. It might take getting used to but in the end, it's not so bad :) | Way too energetic, needs to calm down. He was way too invested in this course than most of the students. His earrings threw me off and i could not focus in class. Way too many in class activities that you are forced to work in groups of four even if you didn't want to."
"Kotelnikov, Alexei","Great professor, go to office hours if you need extra help! | Kolesnikov is, and I cannot stress this enough, the BEST teacher I've ever had. Never before have I seen a professor care this much about his students succeeding. He strikes the perfect balance of giving students every chance to pass and making sure we really learn the content. He'll go above and beyond to ensure every individual student does well. | One of the best professors I've had. Lecture is great, which is important bc open note tests are designed more to show that you understand concepts instead of just getting problems right. There's weekly online homework that is about 10 problems to solve, and written homework which is more wordy problems like the tests (6 or 7 thru the semester). | Alexei is very chill and nice. Little bit of accent but very clear. If you have not taken Calc before, this class will be really tough, but he explains everything in such a way that really helps you understand. Get used to the grading criteria on tests... explain everything that you are doing, NOTHING is just understood - only like a one word expl | There is team assignments , 30% of final grade. 2 exams and a final. Team chances after each exams. Team assignments consists of programming & math problems. Cryptography isn't an easy class but if you have good attendance and go over the team assignments problems, you should be fine for the exams. | I came into Calculus 1 not having any pre-calculus background. This class was extremely hard for me but Alexei made it better. He is a very particular grader and expects things to be done a certain way but he really works with you if you don't understand. He stayed at countless study session lasting to 1 am with us. All I needed was a C. | Kolesnikov is the best professor I've ever had. This class was very hard but if you are willing to put in work, you will pass. Even though he might have not been the easiest professor, I learned so much from him. Make sure to go to office hours, he is always available. The night before final he stayed all day to help us. Highly recommend. | Amazing Professor. Will go out of his way to help you before exams. This class was super hard, but as long as you are willing to put in HOURS of work, you will definitely see results in the end. He doesn't leave you hanging. | Professor Kolesnikov has been so helpful. Hosting two 4 hour long study sessions twice a week right before an exam has helped me immensely! He gives extra credit assignments that adds percentage to your exam. Definitely a highly qualified caring teacher - he is extremely patient. | He has high expectations for his class. He is a funny person, but not a good teacher. He usually skips steps, not good at explaining things in detail. DO NOT TAKE HIM if you're not a math major. | Great professor! Dr. Kolesnikov is very knowledgeable and is very willing to help during office hours. He does study groups after class before every exam and actively participates with his students. You can tell he is very passionate and if you show the same drive/passion he takes note. Homework volume is average but difficulty is high on written. | He's a great professor, I took him for Linear Algebra and he's great! He's funny, engaging and is really welcoming during his office hours. He assigns a lot of homework and moves really fast, but towards the end of the semester he slows down, which I really appreciated. He offers a lot of extra credit, but again, you have to work for it. | Best professor I have ever had. Calc II is one of the hardest classes in college, and he teaches it so well I not only passed, but actually learned instead of memorizing. He went out of his way before every test to reserve a room for his students, and he stayed for 8 hours on one occassion, on a sunday. You will not find a more passionate professor | He's amazing! He taught me to think critically and gave Team homework so we could learn from each other. His tests and final were doable, (we learned fields, rings, and groups), but you must know the material well since he wants conceptual proofs rather than restating definitions. Overall, he enhanced my math skills and is worth the experience! :-) | Dr. K is the hardest teacher i've ever had at Towson. His homework's are the most difficult thing in the course and they do not correlate at all with the exams. Makes you solve all examples on your own in class with no direction at all. If you want to understand the material you need to see him A LOT outside of class. | Hardest class I have ever taken!!! If you struggle with Math, AVOID him!! He gives insane HW and the problems are HARD!! | Dr. K is one of the most difficult prof I've taken but he's also one of the most willing to work with students during his own free time. His teaching method makes you construct your own knowledge so don't expect him to give you answers (best way to teach). I'd recommend him to everyone taking a math class! | Dr. K is the best prof I have ever had & most likely will ever have. He does expect you to put in a lot of work for his classes but you can go to him during his office hours and he'll help you work through any problem, even if it's not for his class. Super smart man, has an odd sense of humor but clearly loves teaching & is there for the students | he helped me so much throughout the semester. He is my favorite professor | Math sucks, and this class is really hard even coming in with some calc experience. But Alexei is an amazing teacher, even during 2 hr long classes he makes the time fly by. He's also really funny and understanding. Lots of homework a week but you'll need the practice. 3 midterm tests and 1 final. | Amazing teacher, highly recommend for only Math majors, Will not teach in details. Expect you to know everything before u come to class. If U take this class it will feel more like taking calculus 2. I didn't take pre calculus but Calculus is not supposed to be this hard. Too many homework, didnt have enough time for other classes. NOT RECOMMENDED | Great helpful teacher. Hard subject but helps you understand | Really liked him personally, wouldn't take another class with him to save my life. Math majors would probably really enjoy him. Speeds through examples, skipping steps, and expects you to remember every potential algebraic manipulation since third grade. Assigns the hardest problems in the chapter for homework. Get your working boots on, and pray. | hard class, but he teaches very well. it's not quite as hard as some think because his grading is different, >60% is a C on Exams. | Will challenge you; but is an awesome teacher. | one of my favorite professors at towson so far. he really teaches you the material rather than just writing stuff on the board & having you memorize the steps to do something. he goes over a subj with the class then he puts an ex on the board & has you try to figure it out on your own but he goes around & helps you through it. it really helped. | extremely hard, and expects alot out of his students, including remembering almost all material taught in pre-calc. Some concepts he is really good at explaining though, others, so-so. | Professor is extremely hard. Very smart but succeeding in this class will be very hard. Extremely hard tests(only 8 problems/test)and homework 3x/week(witten(hard), online(easy), mathamatica(easy)) | Exams are hard. Homework (3 a week:written, webwork, and mathematica)is even MORE hard. He has a good sense of humor but he has favorites. | Awesome guy. He's really nice and super helpful. He has a good sense of humor. I took this class once before and had to withdraw, but when I took it with him I got a B+. He requires group homework, which can be really helpful, depending on who's in your group. It was a really tough class, but he made it not so bad. I highly recommend taking him. | he is a great professor highly recommended for calc 273. Calc is hard but he is willing to help and makes thing easier especially if he knows you are trying. And he has a good sense of humor. a great guy... take himm"
"Farokh, Pedram","He knows the subject, obviously, and he expects you to study hard. He is intelligent, and the level of his lectures is above average. he used real work examples in the course, which makes it so cool and relatable and shows his experience in the field. He is caring but a tough grader too. | He is an excellent teacher since he is caring and pays attention to details. He is responsive to his email. He is the best teacher I had at JSMB. Too bad not teaching there anymore. | I love how passionate he is about teaching and his career, I will take what ever he will be teaching | I took this course a year ago, and I got a great grade. better than my expectation tbh, he changed my opinion about the finance major at school, his lectures were inspirational. | he is a real gem. | Excellent professor. Knows his stuff. exams are not easy but can get good grade | I enjoyed every session, I wish it wasn't an online course. I will take what ever he teaches at JMSB. | He really tried to make his lectures interesting by giving real-work examples. and also helped us with the quizzes and exams. It is just a difficult course. I tried to get a better grade. | Although I hate online classes, he is trying t make them more interesting, I really enjoy his lectures. He is caring and listens to students. | Maybe its the subject matter but his lectures are EGREGIOUSLY boring. Can sometimes be unhelpful and will usually ignore your questions for the sake of moving on. Intelligent and knowledgeable yet not necessarily the best teacher. | Great lectures | He is so confident in his class that makes him inspirational. | I should have studied more for the course. But he is amazing and caring. | Fina 385 was a tough course for me. Although he is young, his knowledge was beyond my expectation. I'd rather take any class with him again than other profs. | He is an amazing lecturer. | He is young and energetic professor. He respects you and does his best to answer your questions to make sure you understand the points. He does lots of problems in class and you always can count on his help | Very knowledgeable, down to earth, super-nice, and most importantly accessible out of class for addressing your questions! Don't miss the opportunity to take a course with him!young yet better than most teachers at JMSB who claim to have years and years of experience, he is very patient and goes through every detail with you. | This course had a class project and he was really supportive. He knows his stuff and unlike many profs, at JMSB he is very fluent in English, although English is not his first language. Very nice professor! He is knowledgeable and approachable. His lecture is clear and he stressed every detail that we might encounter in the exam. | Best professor ever I have ever encounter in JMSB so far!!! He is beyond amazing with his passion and cares for the understanding of students. He's truly amazing! His lectures are crystal clear, straightforward and easy to understand | Amazing. Best teacher I've ever had at Jmsb. He does care about students, unlike other JMSB profs. | This teacher will rarely respond to your emails. I STILL DID NOT EVEN GET MY GRADE BACK WHEN THE NEW SEMESTER HAVE ALREADY STARTED AND HE DROPPED THE WHOLE CLASS GRADE BY 10% AT THE END!!! Also forget about his office hours. HE WILL ALWAYS BE LATE and you will be already gone before he comes. His exams are not hard BUT IT HAS TONS OF MISTAKES!!!!! | Pedram is a really nice person and teacher. Cares a lot about his students and his classes are not boring. He's a little bit nervous since he doesn't have too much teaching experience, but he improved that a lot through the semester. He is really approachable and he will explain to you a whole concept or chapter during his office hours if you need | Clearly cares about his students. Seemed a bit nervous when lecturing, though that might be because it's his first year teaching. Would take again. | He is a nice guy and encourages students to ask questions, but sometimes he couldn't answer the questions. He reads the slides and doesn't explain well. You have to learn by yourself. | He cares a lot about students, makes easy midterms and gives a lot of hints about the type of questions. Unfortunately, he reads off of slides and explains very poorly. It seems as if he doesn't manage the topic well because he didn't know the answer to a lot of simple questions asked by students. If the topic interests you, don't take him."
"Singh, Jeevanjot","Lectures were not in line with curriculum. We still needed to learn the fundamentals of scheduling and estimating but instead she assigned us a very confusing term project which took nearly the entire semester to complete. By the end of the class, most of us did not have the skills or knowledge that were supposed to prepare us for the next semester | I really like this professor!"
"Nikolopoulos, Efthymios","He's a great professor. So unique and inspirational. Creative writing was an enjoying relaxing class. Honestly just show up, participate, and do all the work and you should get an A. He brings his cute dog too. He's not bad on the eyes too. | Angelo is my favorite professor this semester. His creative writing course is fun and he treats it like a graduate class where we workshop each others works during class. Not to mention he brings his ADORABLE dog to class. | Intro to Creative Writing was my favorite class this semester, and one of my favorites ever. Show up for every class, participate in discussions, and turn in your work on time and you'll have an A. Angelo is so much fun and absolutely hilarious. Read what you're assigned (which is mostly really awesome), say what's on your mind, and have fun! | I listed in my tags that I would take again-- and I really would. Easily my favorite professor of the semester (although i just transferred into Rutgers), he is an inspiration and a joyous person to be around; his creativity is infectious. Made me a much better poet than i originally had been. | Great class. Read some poems, write in ANY way that writer or style speaks to you. Good with feedback, relaxed fun class. TAKE IT!!! | LOVE HIM, LOVE THIS COURSE. very laid back, get to explore creative writing in a fun way. Mainly focuses on Poetry and then one assignment of short fiction. TAKE THIS CLASS, EASY NO TEXTBOOK. LOVE HIM | He's an awesome professor! The class is always fun and interesting. Definitely take him for creative writing if you need a class that wont stress you out. | He's funny, nice, keeps things interesting, has great insight, is very understanding, and brings candy to class! Talented teacher and poet. | Really nice creative writing teacher. Each week a poem/short story is due and you do group workshops on your work with the entire class. Basically an easy A though you don't really know you're grade until they're released at the end of the semester. | Fun, interesting, enjoyable class. He created a great classroom atmosphere and offered helpful criticism without putting anyone down. Recommend. | Professor is extremely funny and interesting. He is very strict about attendance though."
"Yang, Guosong","Jing Yang is unsympathetic and cruel. My mother passed away during the semester and I left school for a month in bereavement and preparing her funeral, and when I returned I told Ms. Yang and she made me complete two projects in a week and took off 30 points because I was a month late, the month I was mourning my mother and preparing her funeral. | Professor Jing was a decent professor. She is always wanting to help her students succeed. The only confusing thing was that she was not always super clear with her instructions on the assignments. Otherwise, she is understanding and pretty lenient with late work as well. | Get out of this class while you still can. The worst professor I have every had. I did not get any help or advice. The only thing I got was depression. | You could lose your arm to a shark attack and still not get an extension for an essay. No remorse, she doesn't even believe in you most of the time. And somehow a 91 is a B. | She was a really harsh grader and just generally inflexible with things like due dates. The class was just a struggle in general and took up way too much time for a mandatory lower-level course. | I've tried to reach out for a 2 day extension to a rough draft because it was given 3 days before all of my midterms, and I was told that I would need approval from the Dean of Students for an extension as short as that. The level of understanding and proficiency in writing that is expected for a 100 level class feels impossible with her teaching. | She caused more pain and suffering than a lactose intolerant person that drank milk."
"Liu, Xufei","Horrible professor, should not be teaching by any means. She has absolutely no work experience hence should not be teaching construction management. Just cause someone has a pHD, should not be the reason one should be teaching construction management. Waste of money, worst professor. Pick someone who has a more reputable background and experience. | She is trying though. Tries to make it simple for students | Don't do it. Grading is super harsh for exams and homework, reads directly off the lecture slides and barely seems to know what she's teaching. You won't learn anything and exams have nothing conceptual on them. Don't waste your time or money."
"DeMauro, Edward","Terrible class, he went through content really fast and presented meaningless formulas without explaining their purpose. He skipped a ton of stuff in lecture, but it showed up on the hw and exam. The exams were open book and I pretty much learned how to do the exam problems by literally reading the book during the exam. He also never answers email. | This man literally never responds to emails. Also will often give a bad/ incomplete answer to the question. Will contradict himself multiple times when answering. On the other hand, he does teach in a very interesting manner. He is never monotonic (unlike 90% of the department). Overall great guy 4/10, one of the best of the department. :) | To do well in this class purchase a physical copy of the textbook. It's worth it, as his tests are all open book closed notes. Additionally, it is important to actually read the book because it clarifies concepts well. Do MANY practice problems. His lectures are conceptual and he rarely goes over any problem-solving strategies or examples. | Had him for Intro to Aerospace. You get 1 beefy homework a week that is usually difficult but good practice. Tests are open book and 1 or 2 cheat sheets, multiple-choice questions can be found in the book if you look. He makes his tests fair but they are not easy, and yes he does curve. Also, go to ALL lectures, there's a handful of pop-quizzes. | Great professor. Even though attendance not mandatory, I would not recommend skipping class. (Regular HW and Quizzes) | This guy is good, but the only thing is he writes all kind of equations from the book, but i really want to know how to them. of course you can apply them on homework. but i really wanted him to do some questions in class. But he curves a lot. just pray every does bad and you do better than class avg and you will end up with an A | The man, the myth the legend. Some say that the first compressed fluid formed when Prof Demauro spoke his first words, others say that fluids never even flowed until Prof Demauro showed them how, and many believe entropy exists because no fluid can move without paying tribute to Prof Demauro. Truth or tales? Take a class with Demauro to find out. | Demauro was very a good teacher and made the lecture material very interesting. However you really had to work for it if you wanted a good grade. | He follows the textbook very closely. But a really good professor, he brings real world examples and stories into the class. He explains every step he makes whenever he has to do math which helps everyone understand. Exams are about medium hardness, if you do the homework and you study at least a bit you should be good! | He was my intro to aerospace professor. He was precise and clear to understand. The exams are extremely difficult but they are open book. Deffinetely do the homeworks yourself and read the book before exam. Otherwise he is very intelligent in the aerodynamic field. He has office hours where he helps. Overall one of the good professors I took at RU"
"Pedersen, Henrik","slackers BEWARE! Dr. Egar has an enormous amount to give if you are prepared to work and listen. He will give you the tools and techniques to write clearly and concisely. Respect his experience, knowledge, and mastery of the English language and you will reap phenomenal benefits. He WILL NOT coddle you! | Dunno if this man still teaches, but I took one of his classes years ago. Repellant human. It's not just ""slackers"" that don't like him. Eger picks favorites early on. Not you? Tough. He will attack you personally and teach little. He couldn't care less about real learning. Eger is vindictive, egotistical, hypocritical, insufferable, you name it. | Dr. Eger was a tough, no nonsense teacher, but he was fair to the point of giving my class a second exam after the first surprised everyone by requiring very precise answers. No one passed the first time. Let me be clear: the class was not easy. It was challenging. I had to step out of my comfort zone. But that is how I grew. | Best Teacher hands down I've had throughout a long college career. Yes, he is difficult. He has high expectations and many students aren't up to the challenge. If you are in college to better yourself and are willing to work harder than you have before then this prof is for you. He doesn't sugar coat things and expects you to be professional. | This class changed my life. From the moment I walked in I knew this class would be different, and on the day I walked out I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness. I did not want the class to end. I will never forget the things that Dr. Eger and the class taught me, and this I could never have learned from any other professor. | This teacher is unbearable, very smart but not interested in helping his student just like to show off his accomplishments and swears he no everything its his way or no way.......Good Luck | Beware do not ever take this class he is aweful. He is anal rententative egotistical and be prepared to do extreme load of work...not worth your money not worth the stress | I love this man. I learned a lot!! If you hang in there it'll be well worth your time... | He is very demanding, wants whats best, but is very harsh, thinks he knows everything, and definitely hates to be challenged. but he is an ok teacher, just be ready to BE STRESSED all the time in his class..CHECK YOUR delgate EMAILS all the time! :) He sends emails out at random times of the day. | Dr. Eger's class was incredible. He is an extremely demanding professor, but he will also give you every single tool you need to acquire an A in his course. He is opinionated and harsh, but it is for your own good. He only wants greatness from his students. I would definitely recommend his class to any student willing to learn and work hard. | Dr. Eger is irrational and gets angry when students challenge his opinions. He is very smart but he is too busy trying to show how much he knows instead of trying to help his students learn. I received an A in his class but only b/c I was willing to ignore his rants. He has a wealth of information, but ruins it by being self-righteous. | Great Teacher! | Dr. Edger only wants the best for his students. I agree with many of the post that he is demanding, but he prepares you for the real world. Nothing is given to you, you have to earn it. I have matured and learn alot from Dr, Edgar,in my opinion he is a class well needed to many students growth in life. | Professor Eger is highly demanding but insists on getting the very best out of his students. Note taking becomes disjointed as he doesn't spoonfeed information. Very useful information that students can take with them throughout life. If you want an easy course or grade, do not take this. You will earn every bit of your grade here. | Very demanding professor, however the knowledge gained from his personal anecdotes along with the class notes proves useful in everyday life. If you are looking for an easy class, don't take this one. Professor Eger expects you to perform at your best level and will call you on your nonsense if you try to hand in mediocre work. | If you are willing to work hard in this class and want a challenge, it's worth it. He makes the schedule so that the beginning of the semester is hard and by the end the workload lightens up. He wants his students to do well and goes out of his way to help you if you take the initiative to ask for help. | Terrible professor. Belittles his students and exploits your flaws to the entire class. Cares more about writing down useful information he blabs on about more than the actual papers and materials. Strongly advise switching professors, getting an A in this class was a huge achievement, | Dr. Eger is an AWFUL professor! He belittles his students and gets angry when anyone challenges him. He makes condescending remarks and likes to ""weed out"" anyone who will not do things his way. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. | Dr. Eger is absolutely one of the most rotten people I have ever met. There aren't enough words to clearly express how awful of a person he is. I had a professor offer to pull strings to get me out this class after the drop date because he's horrible. I stuck it out, and I got an A. I felt incredibly accomplished for making it through! | Dr. Eger is class brought out the best in me. He genuinely cares about his students. His class is not easy though, that is because he expects the best from his students and nothing else. He is fair in his grading. Do your work, read Course materials, read Syllabus, follow exact directions & finally, check emails often and you will succeed in his class. | Dr. Eger is more concerned about demonstrating his knowledge and personal sense of accomplishment than he is about teaching. Only 2 out of 24 of us completed his class. He asks you to memorize sections of text rather than discuss content and share ideas. He does not value your opinions if they're different from his. I would suggest avoiding him. | This man, despite his experience, should not be teaching. Please don't take his class. | I had Dr. Egar about 8 years ago. He's one of those teachers that will leave a good or bad life time impression on u. He really expects a lot from his students and is passionate about the subject. He can be scattered-brain at times but it was a great learning experience. I was 1 of 5 students remaining in the class of 30. I received a 'B'. | Worst Prof. ever! The first day of class he made us read and summarize the whole table of contents from the book required for the class. He also forced us to read his syllabus everyday in class. I had him for fall 09 and the deadline to drop him was on the first day of class so it was too late for me. The other bad comments listed are very true. | I AM WARNING YOU DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.. I had him a few yrs ago, I felt so degraded, He made us make name tags and tape them to our desks, if you diddnt write down every little thing he says [even if irrelevant to the course] he gets in your face like a drill sargent. Not to mention on your papers he takes 10pts off every MLA violation BEWARE | He needs to do a 180 with his teaching methods and actually grade papers on content not as much as on structure. Lastly, also walk into oncoming traffic | Not an easy class, required a lot of work. It's manageable if you keep up with things. His grading is tough, but it was not hard to pass. If you want anything more than just a pass you will have to work very hard. Do what he tells you to do, it will train your mind to become a better writer, not just to make one template to use for all writing. | Overall: DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER Didn't like: always late but made a big deal about us being late, graded papers during class instead of teaching, lectured us about irrelevent things, spoke to us like we were children, graded the last paper especially hard but didn't hand it back until it was too late to revise it Like: useful handouts | Good Teacher learned alot. If you take this class stay on top of everything. Always willing to help his students as long as you make an effort. I would suggest someone take this class keeping in mind being prepared to work. | I do not think Dr. Eger cares so much what students think of him as much as he cares how much his students learn. He is concerned about the whole student-not just their knowledge of English! It is obvious that he cares tremendously about his students. | He's a bit of a tool though. | I learned a lot in this class, however none of what I leaned concerned the material in the course description or even in the teachers syllabus; two documents that you would not believe are related unless someone told you, then beat you over the head till you suffered brain damage and told you again, anyways f this guy I am law school and he is..... | In other words: The antichrist. A pretentious and self indulgent moron who plays favorites. Didn't like me. I took 10 courses at DCCC and recieved 9 A's and one B. Where do you think the B came from? Avoid the class if you can. | I'M TELLING YOU NOW DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! All he talks bout is him-self. I learned nothing at all from this class !! If you have him get out now, while u still can !!! | He has some good ideas and can throw out some interesting facts, but he is very strict and cares more about the way papers are presented (font, size, spacing) rather than how well it is written. | DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER!!!! | He was a very hard professor and expected a lot, but you do learn a ton. I enjoyed his class and found him to be very interesting. He really does want you to learn and is willing to help you any way he can. I highly recommend him. | Professor had a lot of great real life advice even if it was a little mixed in with personal opinions. Hope you like to write, a lot of papers. This was a hard course but I really learned a lot. Good experience even if it was a little frustrating. | Understand hes trying to be helpful but he has unrealistic expectations for full time students. Took 4 classes this semester and took 90% of my homework time. Do not take him | Do not take this class. Only 3 people remained at the end of class. I really thought that I could stick it out and pass the class. He is demanding and unrealistic. I would not recommend him to my worst enemy. I have a F on my transcript and he would not remove it. | I WAS A 4.0 STUDENT ENTERING THIS CLASS. I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT I WAS UP AGAINST A NUT. NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED, I COULDNT DO WELL. HE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWELL. HE SAID TO ME AT THE END IN HIS ANNOYING ACCENT, .....""I'M SORRY.....I GUESS YOU DIDNT MAKE THE GRADE."" (MEANING I LOST MY 4.0 BECAUSE OF THE GRADE HE GAVE ME)RUN AS AST AS YOU CAN | when i went to sign up for classes, the counselor was very apprehensive about putting me in the class. if that doesn't tell you something i don't know what will.i didn't enjoy his class and at times hated it but learned a lot, still Dr. Eger is very annoying and i would not recommend this class to anyone. there were 6 people left in the end. | Worst class ever. I was in his class for maybe a week & a half and dropped it. He yelled at me because I didnt have a black folder (I had dark green). He was unbelievable. Turn back now! | Though I enjoyed this class, MANY ppl dropped out. We went from 24 down to 3 ppl by the end. This class involves a LOT of details (including being able to remember specific citations from the text on a Mult. Choice exam). If you know a great deal about grammar and writing, you will be okay. | I had to take this class (SPE100) in order to graduate. Rather than graduate, I am going to drop this worthless, egotistical, soldier bashing ""drilled"",""copius""bullcrap spewing idiot and take my chances with another class at another campus! WORST CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE EVER! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! DROP HIM NOW! | Class was extremely difficult; however, he encouraged everyone to participate. One of my best teachers. | Dr Eger means no harm, he's a nice guy from germany. He might be a little crazy and makes you work very hard, as a result of it I learned a lot. He still keeps in touch with his students via e-mail which no other teachers do. Students are lazy and don't want to do the work. | Recently received invitation for The National Dean's List, I intend filling out also used on my resume, per Dr. Eger. The Dean's List gives opportunity to name teacher who helped attain the honor, that is Dr. Eger. He equipped me to continue in school w/understanding on how to proceed and succeed at the very highest level. Excellent teacher. | I learned a great deal in Dr. Eger's class. If you are not willing to put the time and effort into learning how to become a proficient writer and perhaps an eloquent writer, this would not be the class for you. If you are a serious and mature, Dr. Eger will give you 150% of his time and energy. His life motivation is to simply ""teach"" . | I was excited to take this course.Dr. Eger seemed okay, but in the 3rd wk, i was one of only 7 remaining students out of 30. we finally went to the dean to discuss his constant tardiness, condescension, unclear assignments, and basic degradation of students. luckily the dean allowed us all to add/drop into a later accelarated course. Worst experi"
"Oathes, Tyler","Well organized course with few assignments. Professor Carson is always prompt to reply to emails and is easy to approach in class. | Essentially five papers in a summer session. Not too bad unless you have other classes or anything else to do. | I think he appreciates his students and can relate to them. He assigns a lot of reading, but gives opportunities to ""opt-out"" of the reading of sorts, through reading assignments only being due at certain points in the semester based on readings YOU chose from the syllabus. No multiple choice tests, all essay-based."
"Al-Adhami, Hiba","She's kind on a personal level, but as a professor, she's adamant, blunt, and intimidating. She looks for participating students who visit during office hours and answer questions during lectures to show their understanding. | a lot of homework that does not get graded till the end of the semester | last minute to grade, does not follow syllabus | just bad , last min to grade, rude doesnt allow u to speak and barley replies to email, does not follow syllabus ever | Early on, I thought people were being dramatic about her being difficult to communicate with! They weren't exaggerating, she can get very curt and condescending at times. I'm trying to take my remaining mechanics courses with other departments to avoid her class, it was such a fiasco. Got worse as the semester progressed. | Poor communicator. Will set expectations for you in her mind but not communicate them to you, then get upset with you when you don't live up to the expectations she never told you about. Her class(es) are a very psychologically unsafe place to be. | Very close minded. Hard to get in contact with outside of the classroom. Can come off as disrespectful/combative when trying to have a conversation regarding an issue. Takes forever to grade assignments and makeup exams. Lots of homework. Good luck.. | Hard grader but takes forever to grade. If its not her way then its the highway. I did not really understand her teaching style. Hw is on chegg. Wouldnt recommend | This teacher is only suitable for certain learning styles. She assigns a lot of work but takes forever to grade. It is December and I still dont know my grade before finals. Quizzes and exams are in person but the lab quizzes are online. She assigned a quiz during GHOE (very telling). Just apply yourself from the beginning. | She will not respond to your emails; she won't give you a chance to pass. She gives no room for error. The quizzes and tests are all under 5 questions so if you take them in person, it's an L if you aren't 100% sure. She just talks the whole class. | This is one of my favorite professors and she is one of the most caring out of any professor on campus. She will go over the material as many times as you may need so that one may fully understand the material. One thing that is a necessity in this class is to complete your homework, and even though there is a lot of homework it is necessary to do. | She's hard to get in contact with and doesn't respond to emails. It's very annoying. All of her quizzes and test are on chegg. She gives a quiz like every week and homework every week. | Dr. Hiba Ahmed is one of the better professors of the CAEE department. Her lectures are powerpoint slides that come directly from the textbook. She really breaks concepts down and makes them easy to understand. She's also available outside of class for help. Solid Mechanics is a hard topic but I understood it way better than I did my Statics class."
"Bletsas, Aggelos","He's not that bad but he's not perfect yet. | Postgrad students run everything 4 him,he doesn't even care about teaching and he doesn't know how to teach,altgough he has great knowledge... | Useless. Rarely shows up for class. Has grad students run exams. Makes up his own slides and bases exam questions off of minor details. Assigns big projects and then never reveals the proper solution. Overall, useless. | not a great professor. class hw ave are routinely in the 30s-40s. he doesnt show up to his exam reviews and has a grad student run them, who was useless. doesnt show up to give the exams. has a ridiculous curve, ie people with a 5/60 got a C. pretty sure he just doesn't fail anyone as long as you hand hw's in. | He's great. Really nice guy and knows his stuff. Defintely take his class. He makes you work, but you'll learn a lot and have fun. | He is one of the best teachers i have ever seen. He has an amazing ability to explain things so that everyone understands. Classes are not easy; but if you really want to learn the material, you will be satisfied with his class. His homeworks are designed to get you interested in a subject. Great prof.! Take his class."
"Barillas, Katie","She was honestly never clear with what she wanted and always changed her mind on what she wanted right before the assignment was due. I had asked her if what I was doing for her assignment and she said it was perfect and exactly what she wanted but then I had received a 78. She is one of the worst professors I've had and I don't recommend her class | 350 words is not enough to express how unqualified this professor was.Very unapproachable. She has no problem embarrassing students in front of whole class. The class was a writing about conspiracy theories class, instead she used the class as a platform to express her own beliefs, and only talked about Conspiracies for the last few weeks. | Professor Avagliano was a pretty good teacher. She was a difficult grader and didn't give clear feedback but if you pay attention in class and read the directions you'll do fine. She was very nice but a hard grader. | She was the most inexperienced professor Ive ever had. She gave no valuable criticism, purposely failed every student on their first assignment, and manipulated the grades, artificially showing progress to show her teaching effectiveness. On the first day we were all told we could not get an A in the class, and she did everything to ensure that | worst professor ive had thus far. does not give good feedback and made my first semester experience even worse. definitely not clear with what she is looking for and if she disagrees with your argument, even though it might be a valid one, your grade suffers | Ive heard about expos being a hard class in general but I felt like this professor made it harder. I went to office hours a lot actually, and her feedback at office hours would contradict the feedback she gave me on my papers. She was just very unclear with what she expected. Thank god expos is over. | Not a very clear grader, and her comments aren't the clearest when it comes to feedback. But Expos is just a bad class in general for most people. Hated the class not the professor. | I had her for expos and it was her first year teaching at Rutgers. As such she wasn't very clear in what she wanted and wasn't really helpful. She is a super chill teacher and her class is great but she grades pretty hard and isn't super clear."
"Miller, Christopher","I took his phil of death, and I got to say that his a horrible teacher. He goes wandering about different aspect of a topic without any focus, and when you present a particular scenario he cops out and say ""I don't know what your talking about"". Also, he is rude on answering questions and even harass students. Avoid, avoid, avoid! | Learned a lot, rude when answering questions, evil on question comments, but I did a BS final paper and got a B+ in the class so I guess it worked out. | nice cool guy, keeps classes relatively interesting. weekly quizzes help the grades. Responds to emails. | IMO, worst professor I have had during my 4 years at RU. Very inconsistent communicator Rarely would email back even when it involved final grades. Seemed to nit pick small mistakes in essays and was negative with criticism rather then constructive. I did well received an A, but I didn't enjoy the class, even though I was interested in the subject | yes. take it."
"Elsayed, Elsayed","don't take him if you can find a way to take an equivalent course. Save yourself time, you won't learn in his course | Simply put - a terrible, egotistical professor !!! | The grading for this class is not very clear. Myself and others had an 85 class average going into the final and we got Cs or Ds. Also, he assigns 1-2 hour long homework due every single class. Take this class elsewhere and transfer it in if you can | This class isn't difficult, but it's essentially a self-study course. His lectures involve reading off the slides, so you can save yourself time by going over the lecture slides and relevant textbook passages on your own time. One advantage of going to class is that he lets you know ahead of time what questions will be asked on quizzes and exams. | His lectures aren't clear, but he makes himself available for office hours. He graded on a curve and when people were doing bad, he asked if we wanted more or less quizzes, and sometimes even changed the grade distributions to benefit students. Would I take him again? No, that class was awful. But I don't think he is as bad as everyone says he is. | he is so bad, i wanna give him a zero. but that's not possible, so i give him a one. way too much homework, he is never clear during lectures, expects everyone to know everything immediately. the canvas page is also extremely unorganized. he does not communicate clearly with students. if engineering probability is required for you, good luck. | Terrible professor. It was already hard for the students and professors last semester. But jeez, talk about a bad professor. The material was hard enough but manageable if a good professor would have. He's on sabbatical this year thankfully. | Average on first midterm was a 30% and quiz averages would be lower than 50%. With these averages he still blames the student rather than his poor teaching skills (just reads off of slides). The Hw he gives is quite tedious and the test/quizzes are substantially harder than the hw. Will forever give me PTSD when reflecting on my college experience | If this class is mandatory for you, I strongly suggest considering transferring schools, by far the worst professor I have ever had, you will be assessed on material that you are never taught, and always makes sure to blame the students rather than his teaching skills, I wish you luck if you come across him because he will make you go through hell. | HW comes from the textbook and is tedious and repetitive but he writes all of the exams and quizzes which are much are much more difficult; will make mistakes on the lecture slides and then send spam emails to revise each slide after. worst. class. ever. | I can pretty comfortably say he's one of the worst professors I've ever encountered- and anyone that's experienced the Math department at RU knows that's saying a lot. He'll ask you about your opinion on his teaching style and course material, but if you complain he'll list every reason why you're wrong and a terrible student why he's the best. | Clueless professor has no clue what he is doing. The saying those who cant do teach applies hear. Run don't walk away from his class. | I would rather transfer to another school then take a class with him again | Just a total shambolic professor - he's utterly clueless on how to get projects off the ground, and pretends he's your CEO. Just take his course (since it's mandatory), get it over with, and move on ... He's really uninspirational and just ... horrid | horrible professor | Extremely helpful and intelligent professor when you go to him for help. Be prepared to work hard, as you cannot slack off in his class. Just do your work correctly and you will have no problems with the class. | Groups are assigned an extremely advanced project with his desired deliverables being mostly unrealistic due to budget, time, and knowledge constraints. Thinks he's a hero for making students his slaves while using them to boost his reputation. Extremely discouraging and unsupportive. | He is quite possibly the source for all discouragement, though he ironically carries an aura of inspiration around him. He lacks consistency, though his clarity at any point in time is absolute. Whether you take him seriously is done out of your own volition - whether he takes you serious is equally up in the air. | Cares a lot about his student's success in life and in the classroom. Dont skip his class! | Great Professor. Very clear and very helpfull. If you show intrest, he will help you. Dr. Elsayed knows what he's talking about. Take this guy and learn from his advice & corrections. | No Comments"
"Coit, David","Very engaging lecturer and a very fair grader. No one assignment or test is very punishing, so you have a lot of opportunities to improve your grade. The term project is a really good experience, as well as replacing a Final Exam. Pay attention in lectures and you should do well. | Really good, cares about his students. Homework is really hard, and when it's assigned is often a lot harder than the lecture, but it's not weighted heavily and you end up learning a lot. | Prof Shreiber was great, the class format for Tissue Eng II was unusual but he made it work. He's really passionate about BME, and wants to prepare you for the outside world. He's funny, engaging, but serious about making sure you know your stuff. He's flexible with how things are done in class too. | easily the BEST professor I've had at Rutgers so far. you'll definitely get a lot more out of the class than just biomechanics w/ shreiber. definitely go out of your way to have him. no regrets, hope he always stays the same | Amazing professor!! one of the best to teach in engineering.. very prepared.. knows his material on the back of his head.. no curve.. but notices ppl who deserves an A. extremely helpful. makes sure every student putting effort understands material... best prof ever!!! | The material is easy, but it is very boring. Exams can be tricky at times, but overall they are pretty easy. He doesn't give a big curve and does not care if that means only giving out a few A's. He is a tricky guy... makes mistakes in his lecture notes on purpose to catch people who don't go to class. The project can save your grade though. | A bit of a descriminaTOR... and i'm not talking grades | gives too much work and is cheap with grades | decent professor....easy material....project need a bit of work....hard to get an A | No Comments"
