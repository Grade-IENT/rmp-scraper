We love Dean Jean Patrick Antoine. He is the King of the Honors Academy.
Dean Jean is the best. Very approachable, cares about you, and is very helpful. He is my most favorite person at Rutgers.
Really encourages students to get involved on campus. Shows an interest in helping students prosper. Is available by appointment and likes when student come to see him. Is willing to help out in virtually any problem you are having. Overall a great dean!
Great Dean and Professor. Really cares about the students. But you have to be willing to seek his help and guidance. You have to take the first step, then he'll be able to help you more.
Amazing professor! Really cares for his students' success and pushes everyone to give it their all. Definitely has been my favorite professor so far!
